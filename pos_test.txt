i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry mancici music didn t lull me julie andrews was excellant and i sure don t understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor 
the many other comments about the film say it all just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our community cinema and it got an overall average score of 8 6 we d 100 recommend it then for today s audiences especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards as our audience did br br the sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding of course finney and courtenay were truly the stars but everybody was thoroughly well cast for our afternoon audience the majority of whom are senior citizens the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non techy use of camera and sound was a great influence br br how delightful many said to see a really great film that s british still not dated twenty years on not full filled with blood guts not confusing because of bob about all over the place camera shots and back and forth through time story lines no seedy sex scenes such views were even uttered by some who were younger 
julie andrews plays a german spy who falls in love with an american pilot rock hudson while on an assignment for germany br br the songs are beautiful the two are well paired julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays br br a half german half english girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in ww i julie sings some endearing mancini songs br br i loved the film some will say it s a chick flick but so what it s wonderful br br supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped it may not be up to rock s performance in pillow talk magnificent obsession or giant br br blake edwards shot the film in ireland and authentic ww i type planes were used in the film scenery for england and france is absolutely gorgeous 
this short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into his everyday life when he learns why that s not a good idea we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he s been lecturing on 
what a wonderful film filled with eccentric unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast the director also did a great job keeping the story held together getting those wonderful performances and using music to great effect s epatha in the lead role is great i had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is and although i have enjoyed her on law and order this really shows what she can do with a filled out complex role macy gray is terrific mos def as usual wonderful lou gossett great jimmy smits terrific and doesn t try to pull focus because he s a star a true piece of ensemble acting br br rent it enjoy it groove to it and treasure it something special 
ever since i first encountered the divine ms merkerson as a sex therapist in spike lee s she s gotta have it i have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress she received an emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well deserved is a masterpiece of understatement br br here she simply shines as the guiding force and hand in her community this was especially poignant for me for i grew up in this very same time period the production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s 60s and of women like ms merkerson portrayed she was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again i first saw macy gray s name in the credits and went ho hum her performance was so good i didn t even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through i am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in african american culture that is very tastefully done br br another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices br br this is a worthy elegant presentation of african american life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic you owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection br br i highly recommend 
a savage undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival he suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it at first he thinks bugs bunny s home is belong to a camel yet when he wakes bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground there he meets with bugs his next trainer br br if you ever wonder how bugs would turn a savage lion into a hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on you should watch this cartoon director bob mckimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour br br the signature scenes include br br 1 the look of bugs bunny s home cross referencing to donald duck with the b b name acronym on the headboard of bugs s bed br br 2 bugs bunny s short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor br br 3 when nero the lion calls his friend the elephant for help bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the elephant since the elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse he uses nero as a broom br br 4 bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make up and the practical clown jokes that he makes br br 5 the trapeze scene while nero chasing after bugs br br 6 the famous human cannonball scene after which nero the lion starts dancing hawaiian hula br br the magic moments which keep acrobatty bunny fresh at all times in our memory br br 1 when bugs comes out of his bunny hole he thinks he s in the pinocchio tale and starts acting to save pinocchio out of the giant whale s stomach br br 2 when the lion roars to scare him bugs replies back to him with roaring br br 3 bugs arguing with the lion for he s making so much noise then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him br br 4 wearing rubber heels at the circus bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes nero to bounce br br those are the 10 main reasons that keeps acrobatty bunny as a bugs bunny classic and can be found in the bugs bunny classics mgm ua video 
superb editing outstanding acting especially by epatha merkerson and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack this film reaches back to the 40 s to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady br br the actor portraying the young terrence howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate new york town the audience laughed cried and erupted in applause for the film and its director br br soon to be shown on hbo fire up the tivo and enjoy a great story 
a very good film focusing on a very important issue fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable if more families saw this film perhaps more children would not end up like adam jimmie smits performs in one of his best roles ever this is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs this is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the united states today there are children struggling with this world wide the really important point here is that it all could have been prevented more people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously it is well done with important messages handled in a graceful way 
having been raised in canada i saw this short many times mostly on the cbc i have seen it numerous times at many ages in my life and each time the reactions are the same it is a joyous bittersweet beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart i am sure i have it on some vhs tape somewhere digging around br br every kid growing up can relate to the situation and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols the scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless i haven t seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short has br br sure i am a montreal habs fan and that makes my appreciation for it more special but in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it isn t exactly what you wanted and oh yeah the animation is beautiful too br br rating 10 out of 10
what is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews i have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film while courtenay s character is evidently gay he is not the only one the often talked about mr davenport scott is the other and the reason that he is never seen the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity a criminal offense in england at the time br br we can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled norman courtenay s character and we can also see in a passing remark by oxenby the edward fox character the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved the fear of association affects many of the characters and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it the abandonment of courtenay at the end by sir has been anticipated all the way through if this subtext is included it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to the flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that courtenay has to step into the footlights as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man s inner torment br br so while the drama is of the decline of finney s sir a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the fatal flaw of courtenay s gayness and makes this a film about him as the title suggests br br the art direction pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time more distant than the eighties and in some ways even than the second world war the implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant for all its flaws 
this story focuses on the birth defect known as fas or fetal alcohol syndrome a disease diagnosed too often among native americans in spite of the down beat nature of this drama the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well this is arguably smits best performance 
my boyfriend and i went to watch the guardian at first i didn t want to watch it but i loved the movie it was definitely the best movie i have seen in sometime they portrayed the uscg very well it really showed me what they do and i think they should really be appreciated more not only did it teach but it was a really good movie the movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is i think being a uscg would be challenging and very scary it was a great movie all around i would suggest this movie for anyone to see the ending broke my heart but i know why he did it the storyline was great i give it 2 thumbs up i cried it was very emotional i would give it a 20 if i could 
this marvelous short will hit home with everyone who as a child specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your mom or dad that it didn t matter as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a witness protection program in order to avoid ridicule for those u s residents who don t get the horror because you don t follow hockey it s like a dallas cowboy fan getting a washington redskins jersey or a yankees fan getting a red sox jersey it isn t pretty for our european friends think of two great rival football clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other ouch nfb of c outdid themselves here br br une hommage du maurice rocket richard merci m richard

just a great soundtrack really enjoyable music outstanding cast great lead performance worth watching br br doesn t really explain what happened to the neighborhood you are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated br br this movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted i especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like jeffrey wright br br the cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music food drink dancing gambling and sex 
this often maligned movie is a must for fans of blake edwards julie andrews henry mancini or hollywood musicals other writers have commented on the shifts in tone the confusion of plot etc but the film has many things to recommend it the score is one of henry mancini s best several songs are sung to perfection by andrews julie s performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes the on location shots are breath taking and there are some funny inspector clouseau type sight gags to boot rock hudson basically phoned in his performance but he is passably good a real curiosity item in that it was the last major film julie did for about 10 years and in many ways is a precursor to victor victoria it is lovely to look at and listen to when will it be available on dvd when it is i for one would like both versions the longer and shorter director s cut since it was lampooned in s o b they would make a great two pack 
this blake edwards film isn t too sure whether it wants to be a comedy a drama or a musical no matter the sheer presence of julie andrews is reason enough to see this comedy drama musical spy spoof julie is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film rock hudson looks tired but he s is more than fine as julie s romantic interest authentic world war i cars and planes add to the appeal overall the film is very entertaining the dvd release is an edited version of the original release supposedly this is the only version that edwards would allow but turner classic movies has shown the complete version recently recommended 
i ve seen this story before but my kids haven t boy with troubled past joins military faces his past falls in love and becomes a man the mentor this time is played perfectly by kevin costner an ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction to save lives after losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes the young troubled recruit is played by kutcher while his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don t generate enough heat to melt butter he compliments costner well i never really understood sela ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs but her presence on screen is a pleasure the two unaccredited stars of this movie are the coast guard and the sea both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie the movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships but it still works the rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact this movie earns the audience applause and the applause of my two sons 
robert mckimson s acrobatty bunny is one of the director s finest shorts although the circus based setting may evoke hideous memories of mckimson s dreadful big top bunny acrobatty bunny is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty pitting bugs bunny against a ferocious lion acrobatty bunny is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at there s a classic scene in which bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion in a brilliant disney parody he hollers pinocchio down the lion s throat this brilliant opening is a sign of things to come there are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion s cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of laugh clown laugh which as a child i used to impersonate regularly all this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name i ve never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but acrobatty bunny breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst mckimson s best 
our family enjoyed the guardian kevin costner and ashton kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters ben and jake after seeing this movie you can t help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the uscg helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues br br even though this is a fictional movie it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual u s coast guard br br the special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible you actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue br br i feel the movie could have been made without the hollywood bar scene since the real coast guard does not condone such behavior br br very entertaining very action packed definitely worth seeing thank you u s coast guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers so others may live i d highly recommend this movie to everyone 
lackawanna blues is a drama through and through it details the life of a strong woman by the name of rachel crosby rachel is referred to as nanny by all who know her but she could have just as easily been called wonder woman she epitomized strength will power confidence and resolve she owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject her tenants consisted of a lesbian a psychotic war veteran an amputee and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary each successive event rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly she wasn t a dictator devoid of compassion but in fact she was quite the opposite she displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over extend herself br br merkerson did a good job but i believe this role was right up her alley anyway the movie had an even keel never straying from rachel there were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than rachel herself 
this was absolutely one of the best movies i ve seen br br excellent performances from a marvelous a list cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back br br i couldn t help but care about the characters ms merkerson will blow you away as will the young man playing the young lead br br i also thought that the set design was top rate the viewer is really placed inside each era as it s presented br br the music is a blast too nice selections to represent mood time and place the blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs br br this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings take the time to watch it 
lackawanna blues is a fine stage play by ruben santiago hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen this brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors fine music brilliant editing superb direction by george c wolfe and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory yes it is just that good br br the story is based on the author s life as the child junior raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic rachel nanny crosby a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the south from mental hospitals and from the streets to lackawanna new york the boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house odd characters with painful pasts and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by nanny the myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business terrence howard rosie perez mos def the beautiful carmen ejogo louis gossett jr jeffrey wright ernie hudson charlayne woodward jimmy smits patricia wettig macy gray liev schreiber kathleen chalfant lou myers hill harper the list goes on and on br br in the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism the history of desegregation the dynamics of drug abuse and violence the infectious joy of african american music contributions to our musical culture and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact s epatha merkerson is wholly submerged in this role a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos she offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an hbo movie she without a doubt would add the oscar to place along side her golden globe award br br the entire cast is exceptional and wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master like riffs in a jazz piece he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues jazz dancing and joy the production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story highly recommended almost compulsory viewing grady harp
the centerpiece of lackawanna blues is the character rachel nanny crosby who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy ruben the narrator of the film based upon the experiences of writer actor ruben santiago hudson the film lovingly recreates the upstate new york boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s br br the first half of the film is virtually non stop music the second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse nanny s ability to take fragments and make them whole affects everyone within her sphere an especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband telling him firmly if you ever touch that child again we re going to dance as delivered by actress s epatha merkerson that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair trigger temper is frozen in his tracks br br from start to finish merkerson delivers a commanding presence her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home this was a touching heartfelt film with a wonderful cast as played by merkerson the character of nanny simply radiates love this is a film experience that i will remember for a long time to come 
one of the best lackawanna blues br br great movie great cast great music this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes i will w3atch this one many times br br this is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature the cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role you get the sense that you re really there taking all this in a great deal of care was given in the sets costumes and music of the period the relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on but the steady performance of ms merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we ve had our fill of the wonderful misfits to single out anyone other than nanny is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including br br jeffery wright jimmy smits terrence howard and delroy lindo but it is marcus franklin macy gray and ms merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience br br the movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards but it is without question one of the best movies you re going to see this year if you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally tug at your heart lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time then this is the movie for you i ve shown it to several friends and they all want my copy that says it all the movie is that good check it out for yourself br br danceability 1 amsterdam holland
if you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film i would have told you it was great however i left the theatre feeling unsatisfied after thinking a little about it i believe the problem was the pace of the ending i feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow and then the ending developed very fast so i would say the ending left me disappointed br br i thought that the characters were well developed costner and kutcher both portrayed their roles very well yes ashton kutcher can act also the different relationships between the characters seemed very real furthermore i thought that the different plot lines were well developed overall it was a good movie and i would recommend seeing it br br in conclusion good characters great plot poorly written edited ending still go see it 
when the circus comes to town and places the lion s cage directly over bugs bunny s home bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid despite the title acrobatty bunny it s only at the end when bugs and the lion perform acrobatics but even leading up to that it s quite funny what bugs does to escape getting eaten somehow he always manages to use the other character s weakness against him and then pull any convenient object out of thin air bugs later ended up in the circus in big top bunny i liked this one better as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an eastern european accent i recommend this one br br and with the end we can affirm that it ll never be aloha oe for this cartoon 
 the dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film brilliantly acted by albert finney and tom courtenay how in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major academy award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me but it s nice to know the academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while br br albert finney is a drunken shakespearean actor in a production of king lear tom courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights it s both hilarious and piteous to see courtenay s character showering finney s with attention and affection only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed even up to the very bitter end finney and courtenay work wonders together and though finney gets the showiest moments courtenay is the heart and soul of the film br br grade a
lackawanna blues is and excellent movie the casting was perfect every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played their chemistry together was amazing the acting was superb i felt as if i knew the characters i could almost feel them they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the 50 s and 60 s oh the memories my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see i have watched this movie so many times that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them i can t even list my favorite part because i have so many favorite parts thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age and that is black people loving each other looking out for each other respecting each other caring about each other and doing all we can to help each other gotta go now i have to go watch it again 
i always felt that ms merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills familiar to millions as the lt on law and order she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases always in a supporting role hbo s lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna new york a suburb of buffalo br br the story could be set in any major african american community of the 50 s and 60 s from atlanta s sweet auburn to new york s harlem but the segregation integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny s boarding house the story revolves around nanny s relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day 
lackawana blues an impressive hbo movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several characters touching alive entrancing a great mix of sound and story based on a true story featuring an all star cast a time capsule about  br br you get the point and no i am not on the payola for the hbo crew i would throw around more superlatives but i am about to go out the extras on the dvd include a deleted scene a featurette and commentary the funniest part about the featurette was star lighting they used when interviewing exec producer halle berry br br ok seriously good times a
 sir has played lear over 200 times but tonight he can t remember his opening lines sitting at the mirror his eyes reflect the king s madness his dresser prompts him gently mouthing the words there is an air of desperation about both these men the great actor knowing his powers are slipping away his valet cum major domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife aware of his boss s decline into madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than ease his passing the dresser is really a love story between the two over the years they have become mutually dependent on one another to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other set during the second world war it concerns the fortunes of a frankly second rate touring shakespearean company comprising an equal number of has beens and wannabes led by sir a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called the old school whatever part he is playing he grabs centre stage and bellows out over the footlights bullying his audience into applause but somewhere inside him buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dishes out there still remains an occasional glitter of his earlier greatness it is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for mr a finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham often to the point of caricature and just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor the same goes for mr t courtenay it s easy to write off his portrayal br br of norman as an exercise in stereotyping here we have a middle aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life enjoying the company of the girls and loving the wicked insider gossip rife in the theatre there were and i strongly suspect still are many men just like norman in the profession infinitely kind and patient knowing more about the plays than many of the actors they run backstage with wisdom and affection i believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at mr courtenay s portrait i saw the dresser on the london stage where against the perceived wisdom mr courtenay s norman was rather more subdued than in the movie sir was played by the great mr freddie jones to huge acclaim from the audience it was a memorable performance that overshadowed mr courtenay s reducing him rather to an also ran as opposed to an actor on level billing the idea that sir and norman might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window norman was reduced to being his puppet which i m not sure was what ronald harwood intended but made for breathtaking theatre messrs finney and courtenay redress the balance in the movie restoring equality to the relationship both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the british new wave pictures when they became the darlings of the vaguely leftish middle class and ashamed of it movement when the british cinema virtually committed hari kiri in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door with the renaissance of more substantial movies they re appeared blinking in the unaccustomed bright light br br the dresser marked their return still fizzing with energy and talent shouting to the world at large we re still here it s not a big movie but is assuredly a great one 
no blood no sex no special effects but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you re not really looking and grabs your attention br br great acting great sets great music beautiful storyline if only there were a lot more movies made like this one br br the sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there br br the acting appears like real life and elevates us to the level of awareness of nanny to whom no one is a lost cause least of all the inhabitants of her own halfway house br br best of all it s a true story of misfits learning to fit in i was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie could we all spend some time in nanny s house 
s epatha merkerson shines as nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of ruben santiago jr while growing up under the guardianship of nanny the film gives a good character study of both nanny and ruben and manages to capture life s ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film the supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including mos def macy gray terrence dashon howard rosie perez louis gossett jr liev schreiber jimmy smits ernie hudson delroy lindo and patricia wettig loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling but overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by merkerson 
it really is a great film julie is as usual wonderful singing and acting brilliantly i remember seeing it at the odeon cinema in the haymarket london on its release however julie s non appearance at the uk premiere of star was most unfortunate and due to filming the aerial shots for darling lili over ireland a reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years but darling lili just like star deserves much more public appreciation 
well i have to disagree with leonard maltin on this animated short he loves it and claimed it was hilarious i enjoyed it but didn t see any humor he doesn t even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story living right across the border from canada i have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in buffalo but i didn t think much of this cartoon oh it was interesting and i know what would happen if you wore a toronto jersey up in the quebec area disaster that especially holds true in the glory years of les canadians however that doesn t make the story funny br br back in the 1950s everyone in the quebec provinces idolized the montreal canadians and their star player maurice richard and everyone wanted to be like him when his mother orders a new sweater it has the toronto maple leafs emblem on it so the kid doesn t want to be caught dead wearing it when he finally does and heads to the local rink he gets ostracized from the rest of his hockey buddies what s so funny about that i could see the same thing happening to a kid in boston who is red sox die hard and his mom gets him yankees shirt horrors you couldn t wear it and vice versa br br maybe to someone who doesn t follow sports at all like maltin this situation seems odd and humorous to him but it s a fact of life or any bit time sports fan and his favorite team it was an interesting story and totally believable but nothing that made me laugh br br the art was fun to look at throughout almost like looking at a long series of crayon paintings done by a talented school kid the french canadian accent was good too this movie was part of the dvd leonard maltin s animation favorites from the national film board of canada 
lackawanna blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy the film clearly supports it takes a village to raise a child and reminds of an important time in black history and culture i gained an incredible amount of respect for macy gray as an actress her character was a little crazy yet lovable clearly we all have known someone like macy s character s epatha merkerson is absolutely fantastic as nanny i never realized that epatha was such a great actress law order never showcased the depth of epatha s acting abilities like lackawanna blues i was pleasantly surprised and amazed the music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood it was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane i truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the dvd release to add to my collection 
i gave this film my rare 10 stars br br when i first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line i almost turned it off i am very glad i didn t br br this is a character driven film a true story which revolves mainly around the life of rachel nanny crosby a strong beautiful black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of lackawanna br br highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for african americans in the 1950 s prior to integration and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the black community br br in addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast there is some fine singing and dancing from that era 
this movie was very good not great but very good it is based on a one man play by ruben santiago hudson yes he played most of the parts on paper it looks like stunt casting yes let s round up all the black folks in hollywood and put them in one movie halle berry even produced it the only name i didn t see was oprah s thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a hallmark movie instead this movie was not some sentimental mess it was moving but not phony the characters came and went with the exception of her husband pauline and the writer in question the movie revolved around the universe of nanny mrs bill crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people now being a jaded new yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man i m thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going getting folks jobs and taking the medicare caid checks but no she explains to lou gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time i think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded new yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks it was written by a new yorker so he knows the deal she almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes i can see why she is married to a ne er do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her terrence howard was born to play these type of parts he was good but i would like to see him play something different markerson who plays nanny is also very good but for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by jeffery wright where is this mans oscar he already won a emmy and a tony he was in shaft and he stole the movie i did not even know who he was in this movie he is a chameleon never the same i never seen him play a bad part yet this was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry i re winded the scene few times one time because i didn t know who he was his wife carman ejogo was excellent i have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff but she is so good here i actually know people who act just like her so it was very real to me macy grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good i was very happy that they did not kill nanny off i thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie but she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people there are women like that in most of our lives people we might know or even lived with thank god for them i do not know how they do it all of the time i have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever i am feeling selfishly sorry for myself i call her and she always puts me in a good mood this movie is a tribute to all of those people i only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on hbo s the wire omar rosie perez s character and richard the lesbian and delroy lindo s one arm man he was mesmerizing in another small role 
 the dresser is perhaps the most refined of backstage films the film is brimming with wit and spirit for the most part provided by the energetic character of norman although his character is clearly gay and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer that he assists the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is br br the gritty style of peter yates that worked so well in bullitt is again on display and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence this is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious in the end the dresser will bore many people silly but it will truly be a delight to those who love british cinema br br 7 7 out of 10
the main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of s ephata merkerson ms merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as nanny the woman who believes in doing good no matter to whom with no strings attached this actress clearly shows a range that is amazing br br thanks to director george wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best black americans actors together this ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place br br of course none of this would have been possible if ruben santiago hudson hadn t written his wonderful play working with mr wolf perhaps the best theater director of this generation they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of ms crosby when his own parents are not around to take care of him ms crosby becomes the adoring mother of little ruben in a way he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter br br unfortunately there is no time to develop some of the characters as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between nanny and the young ruben played with such charm by the young marcus carl franklin who is a natural the only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive as it doesn t clarify or justify what one is seeing frankly just by watching the interaction of the players is self explanatory br br in the background there is always music no matter what hard times these people are going through but nanny s house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era br br aside from ms merkerson other notable performances are given by terrence dashon howard one of the rising stars of the moment mos def jeffrey wright marcy gray louis gossett jr delroy lindo rosie perez carmen ejogo jimmy smits and the rest br br ms s ephata merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience in lackawanna blues she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma 
this film has its detractors and courtney s fey dresser may offend some folks  but the film is top notch in every way engaging poignant relevant finney naturally is larger than life courtney makes an ideal foil i thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads and courtney s character provides plenty of dark humor the period is well captured the supporting cast well chosen this is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial i only wish it were out on dvd already 
lackawanna blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people br br it s editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen br br the music really tied into the story which made the characters come to life the editing made the story more progressive and captivating br br i was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast most notably s epatha merkerson s br br i can t wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer ruben santiago hudson 
yes i am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill julie andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the whistling in the dark production number the sedate to outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that rock hudson has been seeing a dancing call girl is eye popping and will certainly make you giggle br br i only wish that this film could be found in video or dvd as i would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library 
once again bugs bunny sacred home is violated by careless people this time the traveling circus put a lion s cage right over the rabbit s hole so bug s has to come out of the hole and face nero which he does in his usual hilarious style after a slow and rocky beginning to the cart it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one if still shorn of a classic this animated short can be found on disk 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 3 br br my grade a 
albert finney and tom courtenay are brilliant as sir and his dresser of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre and i think you listen better in theatre but on the screen we become more intimate we re up close more than we are in the theatre we witness subtle changes in expression we see better as well as listen both the play and the movie are wondrous moving intelligent illuminating of the backstage story of the company of historical context of the two main characters and of the parallel characters in lear itself if you cannot get to see it in a theatre then please do yourself a favor and get the video 
fun entertaining movie about wwii german spy falling in love with american pilot while trying to get secrets from him for some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970 i can t see why it s beautifully shot has wonderful costumes and interiors and exciting aerial dogfights also it has andrews doing a strip tease and singing a beautiful song whistling in the dark the movie does have problems andrews and hudson did not get along during the shooting of this and it shows their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry still they turn in ok performances the film is a little long and gets way too dark and serious at the end still worth catching try seeing the directors cut the other one runs half an hour longer 
i was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre release last night and though i wasn t expecting to actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part the rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living the weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes i m not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of an officer and a gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste br br like i said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clichés 
i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine i ll admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy i was wrong kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions this one did exactly that the entire theater was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie and were moved to tears during the second half while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears but many full grown men as well trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying this movie was great and i suggest that you go see it before you judge 
i went to an advance screening of this movie thinking i was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines mindless plot and the kind of nauseous acting that made the postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time but i was shocked shocked to find a film starring costner that appealed to the soul of the audience shocked that ashton kutcher could act in such a serious role shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions not since robin hood have i seen this costner full of depth and complex emotion kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in butterfly effect these two actors came into this film with a serious focused attitude that shone through in what i thought was one of the best films i ve seen this year no its not an oscar worthy movie it s not an epic or a profound social commentary film rather its a story about a simple topic illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible that s what i think good film making is and i for one am throughly impressed by this work bravo 
this was a excellent movie i deal with a child who i am raising that has fae and watching this movie was more than word can explain i also purchased the book and it was great i would like to have a copy for my own use and so i can have my son s teachers watch it also i would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where i could purchase it thank you myra i would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children adults with special ability s this movie should be shown again on tv the team of doctor s that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy his special ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrow br br thank you
a boy who adores maurice richard of the montreal canadiens receives much to his horror a toronto maple leafs sweater in the mail i recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey but nearly everyone knew about maurice richard and the toronto montreal rivalry highly entertaining amusing and accurate 
this is a piece of cinematic beauty and it shows more of quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province it takes everybody into a first person experience of the culture to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived breathed and ate everything maurice richard the book does this as well as the short and i m glad that in all the time i did spend studying french in high school this was required reading in both languages br br i thought it was brilliant to have roch carrier narrate this story his molasses thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story the animation was good as well very surrealist which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream fancying over better days gone by br br again as a symbol of culture quebecoise this is unsurpassed one can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove this whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be canadian and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots i m from ontario and this film made me fall in love with quebec maurice richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs 
i m a petty officer 1st class and have been in the uscg for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the coast guard there were only a few scenes that were far fetched the most far fetched was when po fischer went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel s captain out of the engine room that would never happen swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances second the command center it looked more like a nasa command center we don t have any gear that hi tech third the captain of the airstation would not be running the search rescue cases with like 10 people on watch in reality it would be an e 6 or e 7 as the sar controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist sar controller a radio watchstander otherwise the movie was dead on i think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the cg and their roles in search rescue instead of just aviation based rates some of the scenes from a school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff i did and got in trouble for in my younger days 
anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love br br this film taken from ronald taking sides harwood it s a funny br br and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two br br very actorly types albert finney is sublime as the despotic br br shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging br br around him so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatre br br company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown br br tom courtenay is matchless as norman the dresser of the title br br whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless br br really a must see 
this is a must see movie you will laugh you will cry and when it s over you ll wish there were more well written and compelling this movie draws you in and holds on tight the casting was perfect the characters purposeful and the performances outstanding nanny is the standard to which all women should hold themselves strong forgiving protective and never judgmental nanny to me is the epitome of what a christian mother and woman should be a true pillar of the community if i were half the woman nanny is i might consider myself to be doing okay i would have been devastated if nanny had died at some point in the movie but since she didn t i will definitely buy this when it comes out on dvd i can only hope that the story continues and that ruben goes back to lackawanna to try to rebuild the town piece by piece and person by person 
i just watched the dresser this evening having only seen it once before about a dozen years ago br br it s not a big movie and doesn t try to make a big splash but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie br br the dresser is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor and his dresser norman sort of a valet putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these are two men each dependent upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear and norman lives his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway br br this is a character driven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only 47 years old is completely believable as a very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they re taking their bows and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple br br yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there aren t other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the long suffering stage manager madge there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been br br although it doesn t get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay best picture best director and best adapted screenplay br br i had remembered this as being a good movie but i wasn t prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then i encourage you to see the dresser 
darling lili is a mixture of perfection and magic the stars julie andrews rock hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried it s full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you the brilliance of the director blake edwards is shown to be at his best he was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen br br the blend of each song went perfectly with the moment in the film the film opened with julie andrews singing whistling away in the dark and closed with the same song by andrews br br for a film of this excellence to have been such a failure when it was released is a total shock br br as it is inspirational purely inspirational one of andrews most memorable lines in this film 
this is one of my three all time favorite movies my only quibble is that the director peter yates had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene but the performances were so great i forgive him br br albert finney and tom courtenay are absolutely marvelous brilliant the script is great giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during world war ii lots of great subtle touches lots of broad overplayed strokes all of it perfectly done scene after scene just blows me away and then there s the heartbreaking climax 
i watch lackawanna blues every time it comes on it brings back happy times for me i grow up in a big city in the mid west it reminds me of when i was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same it makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost the big mama s of day are under the age of 55 will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other i hope that i was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past the music was great in this movie i truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters i would have paid to see it as i viewed the movie for the second time i figured out who life this movie was about he did an superb job in writing and producing this film i guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you as soon as i can i will be obtaining a copy for my home use i alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than thanks for such a great movie 
 the dresser is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them written by ronald harwood it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights br br as sir the overbearing actor and main focus of the play albert finney is a joy to watch whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the blow winds bit of king lear or chatting to his faithful stage manager madge about the old times as norman his camp dresser tom courtenay gives a fabulous performance wiggling around at the beck and call of lear collecting a bottle to go at the pub or bitchily disparaging the former fool mr davenport scott br br in an engaging support cast there s edward fox as oxenby zena walker as her ladyship lockwood west as the replacement fool and many others br br this film has great energy bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins it is true but being so well acted you don t notice very well done indeed 
as others that have commented around the web i m a 130 pilot in the coast guard having said that and being the skeptic i am i went expecting the over the top cheese factors there was some cheese but all in all not much and the film was pretty accurate br br i watched the trailer again today after seeing the film yesterday i ve realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes this isn t the case br br the movie is truly more character story driven than action the inner struggles both costner and kutcher are dealing with kutcher s is revealed further into than movie than costner s is br br of course there is a minor love story no surprise there but for the most part the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together and after some time help each other heal old wounds br br as girlie as it sounds costner and as much as i try not to like him kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie br br as critics have stated you ve seen it all before top gun officer and a gentlemen etc but what movie hasn t been remade a million times br br i can recall only one f word being spoken and can t really recall any other language br br the movie is 2 hours and for some may tend to get a little long towards the end br br you ll laugh you may cry but i can honestly say it was worth the 4 i paid br br i hope you enjoy the movie 
i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher both have delivered less than memorable performances films while the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar this film was excellent both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film s most unforgettable emotional moment the specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job responsibility to save lives at sea the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowing i haven t seen such angry seas since the perfect storm co star clancy brown played the captain of the coast guard s kodiak alaska base in a strong convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins the film wonderfully and finally gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard it had the audience applauding at the end 
fantastically written acted and produced loved seeing this gleaming talented cast every single one of them give a such great performance this movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart great storytelling br br this is a great movie for black history month full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain with dignity and a belief in a better future it is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood the next time you re in the company of a listening and observing child remember show or he may be a writer in the making 
i always loved this film the music story and the action i especially love the opening and closing of the film the music stayed with me throughout the years the wwi plane battles were great and the comedy is typical blake edwards slaptick is his forte after all julie s singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen the sets and the scenes are wonderful the characters are appealing i loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and julie s singing to them i wish she sang to me in vietnam i also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the wwi music i was glad when the dvd arrived now i can whistle in the dark watching it again and again 
this is one of those movies that you just don t want to end the characters are rich like a well woven tapestry colorful costumes music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war a young man is taken in by a dynamic big hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences br br i couldn t believe this was a made for television film it was so well executed s epatha merkerson is wonderful as nanny and she brings so much life to this role you want to be right there amongst her boarders br br i enjoyed this film so much i bought the dvd 
lackawanna blues is a touching story about nanny a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need it s told from the viewpoint of a boy taken in by nanny when his own mother isn t quite up to the task br br i have respect for this movie for three main reasons 1 it is touching but not sappy it s told in a very real fashion without a lot of the aggravating hollywood storytelling baggage and the ending is quite good br br 2 although it s clearly an african american film being set in the post segregation black community of lackawanna new york it doesn t wear its ethnicity on its sleeve the story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas surrounding their lives it s not preachy it s simply good br br 3 it has a great soundtrack br br generally the acting is strong but not universally so some of the performances simply don t hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray but considering it was a made for tv movie that s to be expected br br 8 out of 10 imperfect but likable good film for a rainy day 
darling lili is fantastic its by far one my favorite films it certainly didn t deserve the poor reviews it received julie andrews playing the title role of lili smith is the best part of the whole movie she is entrancing and spectacular as julie andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far i was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is this movie is just great it s magnificent marvellous amazing funny terribly romantic sad and just an all out thrill and its all thanks to dame julie andrews and to her husband director blake edwards oh yeah rock hudson was ok too br br julie andrews is the beautiful and well loved singer lili smith rock hudson portrays major larabee who quickly falls for lili and she with him but their affair was not coincedental there meeting was planned by the german government because the warm happy singing entertainer lili is actually a german spy lili is told to seduce major larabee in order to get information of the new top secret opertaion though lili is on a solemn mission she falls in love with bill for real making her original quest challenging but lili pulls through and completes er task after she finds out something that is not really true about bill the ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out if anything you ll thoroughly enjoy this movie i most certainly did  br br 
julie andrews and rock hudson were great in this movie musical the opening song by ms andrews whistling away the dark will always be in the back roads of my mind the plot line during world war i is great and suspenseful one if you are a romantic you will love this movie this is a movie that i always enjoy to see again and again 
i first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an lp recording of the soundtrack i liked it so well i went back to see it several times cannot understand why it was considered a flop julie andrews was lovely in this film her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful br br the film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy handed they were still fun br br i recently found i could get a copy in dvd form and ordered it i was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the dvd i ordered 
lackawanna blues is an entertaining engrossing emotionally charged hbo tv movie based on the childhood memories of actor ruben santiago hudson this joyous motion picture experience is centered around santiago hudson s childhood guardian rachel nanny crosby a strong big hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate new york during the 1950 s nanny was a one woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks derelicts cripples drug addicts misfits and everyone else in town who needed a hand up instead of a hand out the crux of the story revolves around nanny s relationship with young ruben a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so nanny took him in s epatha merkeson who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of lieutenant van buren on nbc s law order turns in a powerhouse performance as nanny the neighborhood mother figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town merkeson is nothing short of magnificent in a performance that earned her a golden globe and an emmy award merkeson is backed by an impressive all star cast that includes terrance howard louis gossett jr rosie perez jimmy smits delroy lindo macy gray michael k williams jeffrey wright henry simmons patricia wettig ernie hudson mos def and hill harper as the adult ruben colorful and exciting beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels but if for no other reason is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by s epatha merkeson who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it 
the good news is that the circus is in town the bad news is that s right over bugs bunny s underground home he wakes up as his place shakes like an earthquake hit it when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants stomp by etc br br to be more specific the lions cage is place exactly over bugs hole the lion sniffs food and by process of elimination figures out it s a rabbit bugs curious what all the racket is about winds his way through the tunnel and winds up in the lion s mouth br br i ll say for thing for bb he is totally fearless at least in this cartoon and at least for 30 seconds when he comes to his senses he runs like crazy and we get a lion versus a rabbit battle the rest of the way once again bugs faces dumb opponent one he calls nero but lion is fierce and bugs will need all his wits and somewhat fake bravado to fend off this beast br br about half the gags are stupid and the other half funny but always fast moving colorful and good enough to recommend i mean it s not everyday you can see a lion on a trapeze or doing a hula dance 
i was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater br br we have all seen this plot line before but a good script still works this story is basically about the training of a coast guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines kevin costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader ben randall who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission the movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the costner character and that of jake fischer played by ashton kutcher i am happy to say that ashton is great in this part br br there are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives however the use of humor the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ben randall do his own thing as a trainer kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained i really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud gasp here and there and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie br br we all had a good time and i think you will too 
animated shorts just don t get much better than this wonderful canadian film this short feature is dripping with canadian references and so this film will probably be appreciated by canadians most of all but the basic story is universal and it is told lovingly by writer roch carrier it is a hilarious story that i have known for quite sometime and i was recently fortunate enough to see it again so i simply had to write a hearty recommendation for it this is a masterpiece and a must see whether or not you are canadian 
my yardstick for measuring a movie s watch ability is if i get squirmy if i start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore the film is too long this movie did not even come close to being boring predictable in some parts sure but never boring br br all of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up why not the coast guard too they are definitely under appreciated until the day your boat sinks that is br br the movie was very enjoyable and fun kevin costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn t know when to quit however i was most impressed by ashton kutcher s performance i have never liked him never watched any of his tv shows and always considered him an immature  well punk in this film he does a great job he is well on his way to having leading man status i think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something because about 2 3 of the way in the film stock turned very grainy the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place also at the viewing were representatives from the movie looking for audience feedback particularly on the parts of the film we didn t like br br  possible spoiler the feedback i gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning kevin costner comes home to see his wife sela ward packing her stuff up and moving out he says maybe i should be the one to move out and she replies no you don t know where anything is in this house i should be the one to go this doesn t make sense if she knows the layout so well costner is right he should be the one to leave 
it has been years since i have been privileged to see this movie on tv i only wish i could contact someone to see it again i married a man with three children and two had fetal alcohol syndrome i didn t realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how i can love them and help them overcome their difficulties my step son is now 35 and thank the lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother we speak every month to rehab patients with alcohol and drug addictions and this sharing has truly made monumental changes in their behaviors and endeavors to start out a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol please please let me know how i can get a copy vhs or dvd of this movie or when they will show the movie again on tv if you have not been in these shoes you probably could never understand its value thank you so very much 
this movie with all its complexity and subtlety makes for one of the most thought provoking short films i have ever seen the topics it addresses are ugly cynical and at times even macabre but the film remains beautiful in its language artful with its camera angles and gorgeous in its style skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories tobias wolff br br not wishing to spoil anything of the movie i won t go into any details other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself it takes pride in what it does and does it well it shows the most important memories of life all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling unexpected bliss this movie of its own volition has created in me the same feelings the main character felt when words transformed his very existence and that is one impressive feat 
i throughly enjoyed this short even as a toronto maple leafs fan br br director sheldon cohen and narrator roch carrier captured all of the boy s emotions perfectly from the feelings he had for his hero maurice rocket richard to the excitement anticipation and hope of getting a new montreal canadiens sweater soon to the look of horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother a toronto maple leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful blue and white toronto maple leafs sweater not the rouge bleu and blanc of the montreal canadiens with richard s number nine like his old sweater and worst of all his mum made him wear this maple leafs sweater out of the house you could envision and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got there br br i was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts i ve seen br br 
a fantastic cinema experience i really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out there is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir albert finney still isn t accepted by the ampas after roles in such films as tom jones murder on the orient express under the volcano the dresser is arguably his highlight yet br br i know oscars are just popularity contest but if americans like british actors and actresses why they always left sir finney with empty hands br br on the other hand they gave it to john wayne and marisa tomei i don t know should i laugh or cry br br if you have seen the two leads in the dresser you won t forget what is the art of acting watch this film and enjoy i recommend it to everyone who loves art br br i give 9 10 for this excellent film br br note my criteria is much stronger than this on imdb 
this is a movie that deserves another look if you haven t seen it for a while or a first look if you were too young when it came out based on a play by the same name it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors the young able bodied ones being taken for military service it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company especially with his dresser so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth while tragic overall the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama theater especially shakespeare or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity the backstage goings on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers 
i only went to see this movie because i have always liked kevin costner i felt that ashton did a great job in the butterfly effect unfortunately even though these two actors were are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here some of the scenes were just not believable and didn t have enough story line support br br though the movie claims influence from the hurricane katrina aftermath there was very little to that effect in the movie br br overall i liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective br br the special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating not sure i ll ever go deep sea fishing again br br i expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented br br definitely a movie that could ve been seen on dvd 
i have watch this movie almost every night that is was on hbo it is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale i was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played nanny she is an outstanding actress of course my favorite actor is terrance howard he is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received ebony magazine did do a nice article on him giving him some of his due propers lakawanna blue gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us they were from a similar town philadelphia pa were they had to have their fun in the junt joints and such i also like to say that mos def is a incredible actor he has found his calling i ve seen him in several movies where he has played a variety of roles from thug to doctor and he has the stuff overall please put lakawanna blues on video for rental 
 br br what more can you ask for a great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century two fine emotional performances by courtney and finney a realistic vision of war time london a great supporting cast this film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour sadness loss and fulfillment if you are in the theatre it is even more effective this is a true 10 on the rating scale 
this was a great movie something not only for black history month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child the performances by s eptath was outstanding mos def and his singing was off the hook had to do a double take when i saw that was rosie perez there but the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching all the different stories they had was amazing and how nanny protected jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence i can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone cant wait for it to come out on dvd it would be a welcome addition to any movie library 
channel zapping one night i just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning it tells the sad story of an adopted child adam whose mother left him after birth the movie takes us through his childhood and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from adam s past i will not reveal more but it is a very in depth movie and will intrigue you for sure this was one of jimmy smits best roles in my opinion 
i would assume that this film would get rave reviews in canada particularly in quebec that s because the canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the montreal canadians were like gods in canada for decades as an american the closest thing we have to them are the new york yankees if you are a fan then they are the greatest and winningest team in history if you are not a fan then they are satan s team well at least that s how it was as i grew up in washington dc in regard to the dallas cowboys so i am pretty sure when this film was shown up north that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction their national sport and the closest thing they have to a national team in the nhl br br now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around ottawa and rooting for the canadians and maurice the rocket richard however when his mother accidentally buys him a toronto maple leafs jersey and forces him to wear it i knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy this ability to connect to the character even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film the way the other kids treated him and his conversation with god at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film very clever and memorable 
this movie made by the nfbc was made in honor of the montreal canadians dynasty years in the 50 s 60 s and 70 s my 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986 i have been a canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life on a scale of 1 10 i give this film a 117 all hockey fans should see this as i hope it will be placed in the hockey hall of fame in toronto and shown at the bell centre in montreal or here in edmonton at rexall place watch this film with your family it is a great movie i also recommend the book in both french and english go habs go 
brilliant and moving performances by tom courtenay and peter finch 
i suppose i like this film as well as any i know it is not perfect but under the title the americanization of lily this charming and memorable semi musical satire might i suggest have been appreciated more and still loved by those who recognized its special blake edwards produced spirit of gentleness clever humor and solid narrative the improbably but delightful story line follows lili smith a fringe type spy for the germans in a much simpler and less black and white war lili schmidt passing as smith is helping her uncle who is patriotic too for germany but neither cruel nor political merely opportunistic lili s target is william larrabee a charismatic u s squadron leader who can supply her valuable information the plot thickens comes when lili falls in love with larrabee has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes she gets jealous of a rival for larrabee s affections then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business the logical end of the film comes when after the terrible wwi has ended as she sings the theme song of the film wishing in a darkened theater one by one the members of larrabee s squadron appear including her lover himself indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents and even uncle kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of it s a long to tipperraree to indicate all is well with the world again this is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea written by director blake edwards and william peter blatty of john goldfarb fame and it is a delightful narrative larrabee s squadron including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic both in its scope and realization credit must go to jack bear and donald brooks for their costume creations reg allen and jack stevens for sets fernando carrere for another beautiful production design henry mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score and to russell harlan for his shining cinematography in the beautiful footage the principal actors are julie andrews as lili rock hudson as larrabee keremy kemp outstanding as lili s uncle kurt michael witney lance percival as the inebriate pilot gorgeous gloria paul as lili s stripteasing rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts it is hard to say enough nice things about the pace or the cleverness of the just this side of broad comedy this element is introduced by edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare to example the almost comic opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent minded era of human civilization this comedy also helps prepare the way for lili s conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing this is a rare sense of life film about lili s americanization her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen it is haunting i find and beautiful in many ways i consider it to be blake edwards masterpiece of directing and under the title the americanization of lili i believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard i know 
i work at a movie theater and every thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next day today it was the guardian i saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie well turns out this movie was a lot more than i would have thought it was a great story first of all ashton kutcher and kevin costner did amazing acting work in this film being a big fan of that 70 s show i always found it hard thinking of kutcher as anyone but kelso despite the great acting he did in the butterfly effect but after seeing this movie i think i might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor br br it was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the u s coast guard 
even a bad julie andrews musical is worth watching and this isn t bad in fact it s quite entertaining actually it s a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star s personae br br to break julie s goody two shoes mold she plays a german spy english musical hall actress she subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie s o b and play a drag queen in victor victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby blake edward s direction br br the movie is admittedly problematic it is hard to feel for her character because she s a german spy we want to love julie but she s on the wrong side of the law probably this is why this movie flopped julie as a german spy our mary poppins our maria van trapp suddenly a german spy br br the romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere but never mind it s a musical and it has jullie oh and did i mention hunky rock hudson is in it too br br julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss great ww 1 songs and nice tunes by mancini br br yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn t seem logical for example why is julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the germans when a minute ago she was spying for them br br but on another note who cares the musical numbers are fun and exciting the costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish the cinematography quite on the mark br br it has the annoying idiot detectives that blake edwards puts in all his movies br br but it has julie trying desperately to change her image you can imagine dinner with blake and julie julie blake we need to change my image br br blake i will make you a german spy then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie they won t recognize you it will be the death of maria von trapp br br fascinating study on changing an image wonderful julie a must see for musical comedy buffs much more entertaining than star 
i am an avid julie andrews fan and i just watched this for the first time on dvd the director s cut version i was very surprised that it was rated g how did they get bedroom scenes a seduction story line two strip tease acts and war shooting blood into a g rating weird i would rate it pg 13 br br other than that i thoroughly enjoyed the movie it was a beautiful showcase of andrew s voice and talent the acting was great the storyline was a little weak leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue there were too many no talking just walking scenes for me i would have liked to see the the relationship between julie and rock blossom so that the intense love would be more believable 
how many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this i can t count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint i was reminded so often of other movies it became a big distraction one of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 day after tomorrow one line by itself is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk br br but br br see the movie despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever while borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard in fact you ll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out why  costner and kutcher played their characters very well i have never been a fan of kutcher s and i nearly gave up on him in the guardian but he surfaced in good fashion costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of costner s ability i don t think mrs robinson had anything to do with his success br br the supporting cast all around played their parts well i had no problem with any of them in the end but some of these characters were used too much br br from here on out i can only nit pick so i will save you the wear and tear enjoy the movie the parts that work work well enough to keep your head above water just don t expect a smooth ride br br 7 of 10 but almost a 6 
this is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times i ll go so far as to put it up there with ray and the aviator it is the story of a young bi racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing miss rachael aka nanny you will fall in love with nanny a woman who gives all of herself to those around her s epatha merkerson brings the character to life beautifully and the other cast members are do the same if i were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles i d have to mention everyone in the entire cast br br the music in this film perfectly blends with the story almost dictates the way it goes and what s more this film is actually entertaining it won t bore you at all not even for a minute br br i highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart very entertaining quality film 
this movie was sadly under promoted but proved to be truly exceptional entering the theatre i knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it br br i was caught off guard with the high quality of the film i couldn t image ashton kutcher in a serious role but his performance truly exemplified his character this movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support unlike so many other movies it does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie but in this case i highly recommend that everyone see it br br this films is truly exceptional 
every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love a film where you see people you know portrayed on screen it s cinema very at its best br br lackawanna blues is that film set in 1960s upstate new york the story surrounds a rock solid woman who is the foundation for her community this based on a true story film is told from a child she accepted as her own this child ruben santiago hudson wrote the screenplay br br emmy winner s epatha merkerson stars as nanny a woman who has wit drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home she does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover bill crosby played by the oscar nominated terrence howard br br but make no mistake see this film for the amazing performance of merkerson who is brilliant in this role she encompasses a person we have all known and perhaps love br br lackawanna blues is already on dvd be sure to pick it up at your local video story today br br merkerson has already won an emmy golden globe and screen actors guild for this role br br  howard has an oscar nomination for his role in hustle flow 
i was looking forward to the guardian but when i walked into the theater i wasn t really in the mood for it at that particular time it s kind of like the olive garden i like it but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it br br i m not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit the trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect i m still not completely sold on him something about the guy just annoys me probably has to do with his simian features br br it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers orange face lift my concerns briefly bristled at kutcher s initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglasses a tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin a smirk that d make george clooney proud yeah we get it i was totally ready to hate him br br but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs br br darn you ape man efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy you can quibble about its clichés predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment value br br i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group br br do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival and if all that isn t bad enough sometimes you can t save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies br br man who wants all that responsibility not me i had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought i d have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education br br not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers br br the gist br br moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it s like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance i saw it for free but had i paid i would ve felt i had gotten my money s worth 
 lackawanna blues is so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban blacks during the 50s and early 60s a culture of joy and sadness specific to working class blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture the characters of santiago hudson s play depicted black individuals who lived imperfect lives but maintained strong positive values of love loyalty and honor although the characters moved away from those values at times they did not deny the importance of the values instead they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and those of the other characters without judgment that passed through the life of nanny the central characters were strong and believable the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by gone era pre integration urban life was a time of sensory intoxication sight sound and smell that could almost be experienced by watching the drama lackawanna blues unfold i will watch it again and again 
this movie is certainly well constructed beginning and ending in the dark with focus on lili smith schmidt julie andrews initially the singing angel later the notorious spy br br it s beautiful i saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently while it was dismissed by critics in the 70 s as overblown cinema vulgaris and lacking in structure time has proven them wrong blake edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality br br the film soars and swirls and captivates one must just buy into the premise that julie andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong overlooking the tepid chemistry between julie andrews and rock hudson one must believe that these are lovers who in all innocence fall for each other and in the end love is far more important than winning wars and so is maintaining innocence br br there is a lot of understated acting and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies br br there are wonderful comedic elements interesting diplomatic asides and a general sense of good will br br suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away julie andrews belting out of war songs and the haunting whistling away the dark are reason enough to turn the tv on just for the soundtrack and the striptease number like the jenny number in star works br br this film has like a good champagne aged well paramount should bring it to dvd as soon as possible the same applies to transferring the laser disk of star to dvd these are both interesting pieces of julie andrews meticulous and then underrated works

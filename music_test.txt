gilbert and sullivan refers to the victorian era partnership of librettist w s gilbert and composer arthur sullivan together they wrote fourteen comic operas between 1871 and 1896 of which h m s pinafore the pirates of penzance and the mikado are among the best known gilbert who wrote the words created fanciful topsy turvy worlds for these operas where each absurdity is taken to its logical conclusion fairies rub elbows with british lords flirting is a capital offence gondoliers ascend to the monarchy and pirates turn out to be noblemen who have gone wrong sullivan six years gilbert s junior composed the music contributing memorable melodies that could convey both humour and pathos producer richard d oyly carte brought gilbert and sullivan together and nurtured their collaboration he built the savoy theatre in 1881 to present their joint works which came to be known as the savoy operas and he founded the d oyly carte opera company which performed and promoted their works for over a century the gilbert and sullivan operas have enjoyed broad and enduring international success and are still performed frequently throughout the english speaking world the collaboration introduced innovations in content and form that directly influenced the development of musical theatre through the 20th century the operas have also influenced political discourse literature film and television and have been widely parodied and pastiched by humorists gilbert was born in london on 18 november 1836 his father william was a naval surgeon who later wrote novels and short stories some of which included illustrations by his son in 1861 the younger gilbert began to write illustrated stories poems and articles of his own to supplement his income many of these would later be mined as a source of ideas for his plays and operas particularly his series of illustrated poems called the bab ballads in the bab ballads and his early plays gilbert developed a unique topsy turvy style where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences however absurd director and playwright mike leigh described the gilbertian style as follows with great fluidity and freedom continually challenges our natural expectations first within the framework of the story he makes bizarre things happen and turns the world on its head thus the learned judge marries the plaintiff the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes and so on and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts his genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand to blend the surreal with the real and the caricature with the natural in other words to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way gilbert developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction following theatrical reformer tom robertson at the time gilbert began writing theatre in britain was in disrepute gilbert helped to reform and elevate the respectability of the theatre especially beginning with his six short family friendly comic operas or entertainments for thomas german reed at a rehearsal for one of these entertainments ages ago the composer frederic clay introduced gilbert to his friend the young composer arthur sullivan two years later gilbert and sullivan would write their first work together those two intervening years continued to shape gilbert s theatrical style he continued to write humorous verse stories and plays including the comic operas our island home and a sensation novel and the blank verse comedies the princess the palace of truth and pygmalion and galatea sullivan was born in london on 13 may 1842 his father was a military bandmaster and by the time arthur had reached the age of 8 he was proficient with all the instruments in the band in school he began to compose anthems and songs in 1856 he received the first mendelssohn prize and studied at the royal academy of music and at leipzig where he also took up conducting his graduation piece completed in 1861 was a suite of incidental music to shakespeare s the tempest revised and expanded it was performed at the crystal palace in 1862 and was an immediate sensation he began building a reputation as england s most promising young composer composing a symphony a concerto and several overtures among them the overture di ballo in 1870 his early major works for the voice included the masque at kenilworth an oratorio the prodigal son and a dramatic cantata on shore and sea he composed a ballet l île enchantée and incidental music for a number of shakespeare plays other early pieces that were praised were his symphony in e concerto for cello and orchestra and overture in c these commissions however were not sufficient to keep sullivan afloat he worked as a church organist and composed numerous hymns popular songs and parlour ballads sullivan s first foray into comic opera was cox and box written with librettist f c burnand for an informal gathering of friends public performance followed with w s gilbert saying that sullivan s score is in many places of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded nonetheless it proved highly successful and is still regularly performed today sullivan and burnand s second opera the contrabandista was not as successful in 1871 producer john hollingshead brought gilbert and sullivan together to produce a christmas entertainment thespis at his gaiety theatre a large west end house the piece was an extravaganza in which the classical greek gods grown elderly are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th century actors and actresses one of whom is the eponymous thespis the greek father of the drama its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked offenbach s orpheus in the underworld and la belle hélène which then dominated the english musical stage thespis opened on boxing day and ran for 63 performances it outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration unlike the later g s works it was hastily prepared and its nature was more risqué like gilbert s earlier travesties with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors two of the male characters were played by women whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that gilbert later condemned the musical score to thespis was never published and is now lost except for one song that was published separately a chorus that was re used in the pirates of penzance and the act ii ballet over the next four years gilbert and sullivan did not have occasion to work together again but each man became more eminent in his field gilbert worked with clay on happy arcadia and with alfred cellier on topsyturveydom as well as writing several other libretti farces extravaganzas fairy comedies dramas adaptations from novels and translations from the french sullivan completed his festival te deum another oratorio the light of the world his only song cycle the window or the song of the wrens incidental music to the merry wives of windsor and more songs parlour ballads and hymns including onward christian soldiers in 1874 gilbert wrote a short libretto on commission from producer composer carl rosa whose wife would have played the leading role but her death in childbirth cancelled the project and left the libretto an orphan not long afterwards richard d oyly carte was managing the royalty theatre and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to offenbach s la périchole gilbert already had available the libretto he had written for rosa and carte suggested that sullivan write the score the composer was delighted with it and trial by jury was composed in a matter of weeks the piece is one of gilbert s humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession based on his short experience as a barrister it concerns a breach of promise of marriage suit the defendant argues that damages should be slight since he is such a very bad lot while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks substantial damages after much argument the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself with sullivan s brother fred as the learned judge the opera was a runaway hit outlasting the run of la périchole provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed fred sullivan was the prototype for the patter baritone roles in the later operas f c burnand wrote that he was one of the most naturally comic little men i ever came across he too was a first rate practical musician as he was the most absurd person so was he the very kindliest  fred s creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators works and each of them has a crucial comic little man role as burnand had put it the patter baritone would often assume the leading role in gilbert and sullivan s comic operas and was usually allotted the speedy patter songs after the success of trial by jury gilbert and sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together over the next two years richard d oyly carte was one of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms carte also proposed a revival of thespis for the 1875 christmas season which gilbert and sullivan would have revised but he was unable to obtain financing for the project carte s real ambition was to develop an english form of light opera that would displace the bawdy burlesques and badly translated french operettas then dominating the london stage he assembled a syndicate and formed the comedy opera company with gilbert and sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening s entertainment gilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories the elixir of love which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village the leading character was a cockney businessman who happened to be a sorcerer a purveyor of blessings and curses gilbert and sullivan were tireless taskmasters seeing to it that the sorcerer opened as a fully polished production in marked contrast to the under rehearsed thespis while the sorcerer won critical acclaim it did not duplicate the success of trial by jury nevertheless carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full length opera from the team gilbert and sullivan scored their first international hit with h m s pinafore satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good natured fun at the royal navy and the english obsession with social status as with many of the gilbert and sullivan operas a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story gilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes and he directed the performers on stage he sought realism in acting shunned self conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a standard of characterisation where the characters were never aware of their own absurdity gilbert insisted that his actors know their words perfectly and obey his stage directions which was something new to many actors of the day sullivan personally oversaw the musical preparation the result was a new crispness and polish in the english musical theatre as jessie bond wrote later our stage discipline was strict and unbending gilbert s word was law he thoroughly worked out in his own mind every bit of action by play and grouping and allowed no deviation from his plan he made drawings and took measurements with the minutest care  he had unlimited fertility of invention in comic business and would allow no gag no clowning no departure from his own definite conception sullivan s musical conception was equally clear cut and decided every part must be made subservient to the whole and his sarcasms overwhelmed the transgressor with scorn and now might i trouble you to try over my music he would say to a singer too anxious to display his or her top notes but there was nothing to hurt or offend us in this unswerving discipline we took their good humoured raillery as our due when we failed in our rendering or overstepped the bounds and the patience and enthusiasm of that artistic pair so infected all of us that we worked willingly for hours and hours at rehearsals trying with all our might to realize the conceptions of those two brilliant minds h m s pinafore ran in london for 571 performances the second longest run of any musical theatre piece in history up to that time hundreds of unauthorized or pirated productions of pinafore appeared in america during the run of pinafore richard d oyly carte split up with his former investors the disgruntled former partners who had each invested in the production with no return staged a public fracas sending a group of thugs to seize the scenery during a performance stagehands successfully managed to ward off their backstage attackers this event cleared the way for carte gilbert and sullivan to form the d oyly carte opera company which then produced all of their succeeding operas the libretto of h m s pinafore relied on stock character types many of which were familiar from european opera the heroic protagonist and his love interest the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue the baffled lyric baritone the girl s father and a classic villain gilbert and sullivan added the element of the comic patter singing character with the success of h m s pinafore the d oyly carte repertory and production system was cemented and each opera would make use of these stock character types before the sorcerer gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for as had been the case with thespis and trial by jury building on the team he had assembled for the sorcerer gilbert no longer hired stars he created them he and sullivan selected the performers writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars the repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer john wellington wells would become the ruler of the queen s navy as sir joseph porter in h m s pinafore then join the army as major general stanley in the pirates of penzance and so on similarly mrs partlet in the sorcerer transformed into little buttercup in pinafore then into ruth the piratical maid of all work in pirates relatively unknown performers whom gilbert and sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years becoming stars of the victorian stage these included george grossmith the principal comic rutland barrington the lyric baritone richard temple the bass baritone and jessie bond the mezzo soprano soubrette the pirates of penzance conceived in a fit of pique at the american copyright pirates also poked fun at grand opera conventions sense of duty family obligation the respectability of civilisation and the peerage and the relevance of a liberal education the story also revisits pinafore s theme of unqualified people in positions of authority in the person of the modern major general who has up to date knowledge about everything except the military the major general and his many daughters escape from the tender hearted pirates of penzance who are all orphans on the false plea that he is an orphan himself the pirates learn of the deception and re capture the major general but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers the major general bids them resume your ranks and legislative duties and take my daughters all of whom are beauties the piece premiered first in new york rather than london in an attempt to secure the american copyright and was another big success with both critics and audiences gilbert sullivan and carte tried for many years to control the american performance copyrights over their operas without success nevertheless pirates was a hit both in new york again spawning numerous imitators and then in london and it became one of the most frequently performed translated and parodied gilbert and sullivan works also enjoying a successful 1981 broadway revival by joseph papp in 1880 sullivan wrote the cantata the martyr of antioch presented at the leeds triennial music festival with a libretto modified by gilbert from an 1822 epic poem by henry hart milman concerning the martyrdom of st margaret of antioch in the 3rd century sullivan became the conductor of the leeds festival beginning in 1880 and conducted the performance it could be said that martyr was the 15th opera of the partnership since the carl rosa opera company presented the work as an opera in 1898 patience satirised the aesthetic movement in general and its colourful poets in particular combining aspects of algernon charles swinburne dante gabriel rossetti oscar wilde james mcneill whistler and others in the rival poets bunthorne and grosvenor grossmith who created the role of bunthorne based his makeup wig and costume on swinburne and especially whistler as seen in the adjacent photo the work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military the story concerns two rival aesthetic poets who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village who had been engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment but the two poets are each in love with patience the village milkmaid who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him richard d oyly carte was the booking manager for oscar wilde a then lesser known proponent of aestheticism and dispatched wilde on an american lecture tour in conjunction with the opera s u s run so that american audiences might better understand what the satire was all about during the run of patience carte built the large modern savoy theatre which became the partnership s permanent home it was the first theatre to be lit entirely by electric lighting patience moved into the savoy after six months at the opera comique and ran for a total of 578 performances surpassing the run of h m s pinafore and becoming the second longest running work of musical theatre up to that time in history iolanthe was the first of the operas to open at the savoy the fully electric savoy made possible numerous special effects such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies the opera poked fun at english law and the house of lords and made much of the war between the sexes the critics felt that sullivan s work in iolanthe had taken a step forward the daily telegraph wrote the composer has risen to his opportunity and we are disposed to account iolanthe his best effort in all the gilbertian series similarly the theatre asserted that the music of iolanthe is dr sullivan s chef d oeuvre the quality throughout is more even and maintained at a higher standard than in any of his earlier works iolanthe is one of a number of gilbert s works including the wicked world broken hearts princess ida and fallen fairies where the introduction of men and mortal love into a tranquil world of women wreaks havoc with the status quo gilbert had created several fairy comedies at the haymarket theatre in the early 1870s these plays influenced by the fairy work of james planché are founded upon the idea of self revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference in 1882 gilbert had a telephone installed in his home and at the prompt desk at the savoy theatre so that he could monitor performances and rehearsals from his home study gilbert had referred to the new technology in pinafore in 1878 only two years after the device was invented and before london even had telephone service sullivan had one installed as well and on 13 may 1883 at a party to celebrate the composer s 41st birthday the guests including the prince of wales heard a direct relay of parts of iolanthe from the savoy this was probably the first live broadcast of an opera during the run of iolanthe in 1883 sullivan was knighted by queen victoria although it was the operas with gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame the honour was conferred for his services to serious music the musical establishment and many critics believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera sullivan despite the financial security of writing for the savoy increasingly viewed his work with gilbert as unimportant beneath his skills and repetitious furthermore he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that gilbert s words could be heard but paradoxically in february 1883 just after iolanthe opened sullivan had signed a five year agreement with gilbert and carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months notice princess ida spoofed women s education and male chauvinism and continued the theme from iolanthe of the war between the sexes the opera is based on tennyson s poem the princess a medley gilbert had written a blank verse farce based on the same material in 1870 called the princess and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of princess ida ida is the only gilbert and sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts lillian russell had been engaged to create the title role but gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough and when she missed a rehearsal she was dismissed princess ida was the first of the gilbert and sullivan operas that by the partnership s previous standards was not a success a particularly hot summer in london did not help ticket sales the piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in london until 1919 sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto but two months after ida opened sullivan told carte that it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by gilbert and myself as princess ida showed signs of flagging carte realized that for the first time in the partnership s history no new opera would be ready when the old one closed on 22 march 1884 he gave gilbert and sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months time in the meantime when ida closed carte produced a revival of the sorcerer the most successful of the savoy operas was the mikado which made fun of english bureaucracy thinly disguised by a japanese setting gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic lozenge that would change the characters which sullivan found artificial and lacking in human interest and probability as well as being too similar to their earlier opera the sorcerer as dramatised in the film topsy turvy the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 may 1884 when gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements the story focuses on a cheap tailor ko ko who is promoted to the position of lord high executioner of the town of titipu ko ko loves his ward yum yum but she loves a musician who is really the son of the emperor of japan and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous katisha the mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in titipu when news arrives that the mikado will be visiting the town ko ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether ko ko has carried out the executions too timid to execute anyone ko ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the mikado which goes awry eventually ko ko must persuade katisha to marry him in order to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators with the opening of trade between england and japan japanese imports art and styles became fashionable in london making the time ripe for an opera set in japan gilbert said i cannot give you a good reason for our piece being laid in japan it afforded scope for picturesque treatment scenery and costume and i think that the idea of a chief magistrate who is judge and actual executioner in one and yet would not hurt a worm may perhaps please the public setting the opera in japan an exotic locale far away from britain allowed gilbert and sullivan to satirise british politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial japanese trappings gilbert wrote the mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution g k chesterton compared it to jonathan swift s gulliver s travels gilbert pursued and persecuted the evils of modern england till they had literally not a leg to stand on exactly as swift did i doubt if there is a single joke in the whole play that fits the japanese but all the jokes in the play fit the english about england pooh bah is something more than a satire he is the truth several of the later operas are similarly set in foreign or fictional locales including the gondoliers utopia limited and the grand duke the mikado became the partnership s longest running hit enjoying 672 performances at the savoy theatre which was the second longest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that time the mikado remains the most frequently performed savoy opera it has been translated into numerous languages and is one of the most frequently played musical theatre pieces in history ruddigore a topsy turvy take on victorian melodrama was less successful than most of the earlier collaborations with a run of 288 performances the original title ruddygore together with some of the plot devices including the revivification of ghosts drew negative comments from critics gilbert and sullivan respelled the title and made a number of changes and cuts nevertheless the piece was profitable and the reviews were not all bad for instance the illustrated london news praised the work and both gilbert and especially sullivan sir arthur sullivan has eminently succeeded alike in the expression of refined sentiment and comic humour in the former respect the charm of graceful melody prevails while in the latter the music of the most grotesque situations is redolent of fun further changes were made including a new overture when rupert d oyly carte revived ruddigore after the first world war and the piece was regularly performed by the d oyly carte opera company thereafter some of the plot elements of ruddigore were introduced by gilbert in his earlier one act opera ages ago including the tale of the wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors stepping out of their portraits when ruddigore closed no new opera was ready gilbert again proposed a version of the lozenge plot for their next opera and sullivan reiterated his desire to leave the partnership while the two men worked out their artistic differences carte produced revivals of such old favourites as h m s pinafore the pirates of penzance and the mikado the yeomen of the guard their only joint work with a serious ending concerns a pair of strolling players a jester and a singing girl who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the tower of london during the 16th century the dialogue though in prose is quasi shakespearian or early modern english in style and there is no satire of british institutions for some of the plot elements gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy broken hearts the times praised the libretto it should be acknowledged that mr gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things although not a grand opera the new libretto provided sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date the critics who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio the golden legend considered the score to yeomen to be sullivan s finest including its overture which was written in sonata form rather than as a sequential pot pourri of tunes from the opera as in most of his other overtures the daily telegraph wrote the accompaniments are delightful to hear and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly written for them more lovingly we place the songs and choruses in the yeomen of the guard before all his previous efforts of this particular kind thus the music follows the book to a higher plane and we have a genuine english opera yeomen was a hit running for over a year with strong new york and touring productions during the run on 12 march 1889 sullivan wrote to gilbert i have lost the liking for writing comic opera and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it you say that in a serious opera you must more or less sacrifice yourself i say that this is just what i have been doing in all our joint pieces and what is more must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful sullivan insisted that the next opera must be a grand opera gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto but he offered a compromise that sullivan ultimately accepted the two would write a light opera for the savoy and at the same time sullivan a grand opera for a new theatre that carte was constructing to present british grand opera after a brief impasse over the choice of subject sullivan accepted an idea connected with venice and venetian life as this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music the gondoliers takes place partly in venice and partly in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of republican equality gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos the libretto also reflects gilbert s fascination with the stock company act highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities which plays an even larger part in the next opera utopia limited press accounts were almost entirely favourable the illustrated london news reported gilbert has returned to the gilbert of the past and everyone is delighted he is himself again the gilbert of the bab ballads the gilbert of whimsical conceit inoffensive cynicism subtle satire and playful paradox the gilbert who invented a school of his own who in it was schoolmaster and pupil who has never taught anybody but himself and is never likely to have any imitator this is the gilbert the public want to see and this is the gilbert who on saturday night was cheered till the audience was weary of cheering any more sullivan s old collaborator on cox and box f c burnand wrote to the composer magnificento i envy you and w s g being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion the opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for h m s pinafore and the mikado there was a command performance of the gondoliers for queen victoria and the royal family at windsor castle in 1891 the first gilbert and sullivan opera to be so honoured the gondoliers was gilbert and sullivan s last great success gilbert and sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other s and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin skinned while sullivan eschewed conflict in addition gilbert imbued his libretti with topsy turvy situations in which the social order was turned upside down after a time these subjects were often at odds with sullivan s desire for realism and emotional content also gilbert s political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage gilbert and sullivan quarrelled several times over the choice of a subject after both princess ida and ruddigore which were less successful than the seven other operas from h m s pinafore to the gondoliers sullivan asked to leave the partnership saying that he found gilbert s plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him while the two artists worked out their differences carte kept the savoy open with revivals of their earlier works on each occasion after a few months pause gilbert responded with a libretto that met sullivan s objections and the partnership was able to continue successfully during the run of the gondoliers however gilbert challenged carte over the expenses of the production carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the savoy theatre lobby to the partnership gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to carte alone as scholar andrew crowther has explained after all the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things but in whether carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of gilbert and sullivan gilbert contended that carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others it is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time gilbert wrote to sullivan on 28 may 1891 a year after the end of the quarrel that carte had admitted an unintentional overcharge of nearly 1 000 in the electric lighting accounts alone sullivan sided with carte who was building a theatre in london for the production of new english grand operas with sullivan s ivanhoe as the inaugural work while the protracted quarrel worked itself out in the courts and in public gilbert wrote the mountebanks with alfred cellier and the flop haste to the wedding with george grossmith and sullivan also wrote haddon hall with sidney grundy in 1891 after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair and their producer richard d oyly carte gilbert and sullivan s music publisher tom chappell stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists and within two weeks he had succeeded utopia limited their penultimate opera was a very modest success and the grand duke was an outright failure neither work entered the canon of regularly performed gilbert and sullivan works until the d oyly carte opera company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s gilbert also offered sullivan his excellency but gilbert s insistence on casting nancy mcintosh his protégée from utopia led to sullivan s refusal and it was instead composed by f osmond carr after the grand duke the partners saw no reason to work together again sullivan by this time in exceedingly poor health died four years later although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the savoy with other librettists most successfully with basil hood in the rose of persia and the emerald isle by the time of sullivan s death gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been completely bridged over and the most cordial relations existed between us he stated that sullivan was a composer of the rarest genius who because he was a composer of the rarest genius was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be but seldom is i remember all that he has done for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name gilbert went into semi retirement although he continued to direct revivals of the savoy operas and wrote new plays occasionally he wrote only one more comic opera fallen fairies which was not a success richard d oyly carte died in 1901 and his widow helen and then his son rupert followed by his granddaughter bridget continued to direct the activities of the d oyly carte opera company which staged revivals of the gilbert and sullivan operas until it closed in 1982 in 1922 sir henry wood explained the enduring success of the collaboration as follows sullivan has never had an equal for brightness and drollery for humour without coarseness and without vulgarity and for charm and grace his orchestration is delightful he wrote with full understanding of every orchestral voice above all his music is perfectly appropriate to the words of which it is the setting he found the right the only cadences to fit gilbert s happy and original rhythms and to match gilbert s fun or to throw gilbert s frequent irony pointed although not savage into relief sullivan s music is much more than the accompaniment of gilbert s libretti just as gilbert s libretti are far more than words to sullivan s music we have two masters who are playing a concerto neither is subordinate to the other each gives what is original but the two while neither predominates are in perfect correspondence this rare harmony of words and music is what makes these operas entirely unique they are the work not of a musician and his librettist nor of a poet and one who sets his words to music but of two geniuses in 1957 a review in the times gave this rationale for the continued vitality of the savoy operas hey were never really contemporary in their idiom  gilbert and sullivan s from the first moment was obviously not the audience s world an artificial world with a neatly controlled and shapely precision which has not gone out of fashion because it was never in fashion in the sense of using the fleeting conventions and ways of thought of contemporary human society  for this each partner has his share of credit the neat articulation of incredibilities in gilbert s plots is perfectly matched by his language  his dialogue with its primly mocking formality satisfies both the ear and the intelligence his verses show an unequalled and very delicate gift for creating a comic effect by the contrast between poetic form and prosaic thought and wording  how deliciously prick the bubble of sentiment gilbert had many imitators but no equals at this sort of thing equal importance gilbert s lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to sullivan s music  sullivan s tunes in these operas also exist in a make believe world of their own a delicate wit whose airs have a precision a neatness a grace and a flowing melody  the two men together remain endlessly and incomparably delightful  light and even trifling though may seem upon grave consideration they yet have the shapeliness and elegance that can make a trifle into a work of art because of the unusual success of the operas the d oyly carte opera company were able from the start to license the works to other professional companies such as the j c williamson gilbert and sullivan opera company and to amateur societies for almost a century until the british copyrights expired in 1961 and even afterwards the d oyly carte opera company influenced productions of the operas worldwide creating a performing tradition for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors d oyly carte produced several well regarded recordings of most of the operas helping to keep them popular through the decades many of these historic recordings have been reissued on cd today numerous professional repertory companies small opera companies amateur societies churches schools and universities continue to produce the works the most popular g s works also continue to be performed from time to time by major opera companies and professional recordings of the operas or songs from the operas continue to be released since 1993 a three week long international gilbert and sullivan festival has been held every august in buxton england with some twenty performances of the operas given in the opera house and several dozen related fringe events given in smaller venues in the past 125 years gilbert and sullivan have pervasively influenced popular culture in the english speaking world and lines and quotations from the gilbert and sullivan operas have become part of the english language such as short sharp shock what never well hardly ever  let the punishment fit the crime and a policeman s lot is not a happy one the operas have influenced political style and discourse literature film and television have been widely parodied by humorists and have been quoted in legal rulings the american and british musical owes a tremendous debt to g s who were admired by and copied by early authors and composers such as ivan caryll adrian ross lionel monckton p g wodehouse guy bolton victor herbert and ivor novello and later irving berlin jerome kern oscar hammerstein ii and andrew lloyd webber gilbert s lyrics served as a model for such 20th century broadway lyricists as cole porter ira gershwin and lorenz hart noël coward wrote i was born into a generation that still took light music seriously the lyrics and melodies of gilbert and sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age my father sang them my mother played them my nurse emma breathed them through her teeth  my aunts and uncles sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation  gilbert and sullivan expert and enthusiast ian bradley notes however the musical is not of course the only cultural form to show the influence of g s even more direct heirs are those witty and satirical songwriters found on both sides of the atlantic in the twentieth century like michael flanders and donald swann in the united kingdom and tom lehrer in the united states the influence of gilbert is discernible in a vein of british comedy that runs through john betjeman s verse via monty python and private eye to television series like yes minister where the emphasis is on wit irony and poking fun at the establishment from within it in a way which manages to be both disrespectful of authority and yet cosily comfortable and urbane the works of gilbert and sullivan are themselves frequently pastiched well known examples of this include tom lehrer s the elements and clementine allan sherman s i m called little butterball and you need an analyst the two ronnies 1973 christmas special anna russell s famous routines and the animated tv series animaniacs hms yakko episode songs from gilbert and sullivan are often pastiched in advertising and elaborate advertising parodies have been published gilbert and sullivan comic operas are commonly referenced in literature film and television in various ways that include extensive use of sullivan s music or where action occurs during a performance of a gilbert and sullivan opera there are also a number of gilbert and sullivan biopics such as mike leigh s topsy turvy and the story of gilbert and sullivan it is not surprising given the focus of gilbert on politics that politicians and political observers have often found inspiration in these works chief justice of the united states william rehnquist added gold stripes to his judicial robes after seeing them used by the lord chancellor in a production of iolanthe alternatively lord chancellor charles falconer is recorded as objecting so strongly to iolanthe s comic portrayal of lord chancellors that he supported moves to disband the office british politicians beyond quoting some of the more famous lines have delivered speeches in the form of gilbert and sullivan pastiches these include conservative peter lilley s speech mimicking the form of i ve got a little list from the mikado listing those he was against including sponging socialists and young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue political humour based on gilbert and sullivan s style and characters continues to be written on the u s news show countdown with keith olbermann a clip was shown from the family guy episode stewie kills lois in which stewie after taking over the world sings the little list song about those he hates including bill o reilly s dermatologist the overtures from the gilbert and sullivan operas remain popular and there are many recordings of them most of them are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas they are generally well orchestrated but not all of them were composed by sullivan however even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections sullivan invariably conducted them on opening night and they were included in the published scores approved by sullivan those sullivan wrote himself include the overtures to thespis iolanthe princess ida the yeomen of the guard the gondoliers and the grand duke sullivan s authorship of the overture to utopia limited cannot be verified with certainty as his autograph score is now lost but it is likely attributable to him as it consists of only a few bars of introduction followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera thespis is now lost but there is no doubt that sullivan wrote its overture very early performances of the sorcerer used a section of sullivan s incidental music to shakespeare s henry the viii as he did not have time to write a new overture but this was later replaced of those remaining the overture to patience is by eugene d albert and the overtures to h m s pinafore and the pirates of penzance are by alfred cellier those to the mikado and ruddigore are by hamilton clarke and clarke also wrote the new overture to the sorcerer for its 1884 revival which is the overture still in use most of the overtures are in three sections a lively introduction a slow middle section and a concluding allegro in sonata form with two subjects a brief development a recapitulation and a coda however sullivan himself did not always follow this pattern the overtures to princess ida and the gondoliers for instance have only an opening fast section and a concluding slow section the overture to utopia limited is dominated by a slow section with only a very brief original passage introducing it in the 1920s the d oyly carte opera company commissioned its musical director at the time geoffrey toye to write new overtures for ruddigore and the pirates of penzance toye s ruddigore overture entered the general repertory and today is more often heard than the original overture by clarke toye s pirates overture however did not last long and is now presumed lost sir malcolm sargent devised a new ending for the overture to the gondoliers adding the cachucha from the second act of the opera this gave the gondoliers overture the familiar fast slow fast pattern of most of the rest of the savoy opera overtures and this version has competed for popularity with sullivan s original version gilbert and sullivan operas have been translated into many languages including portuguese yiddish hebrew swedish danish estonian spanish and many others there are many german versions of gilbert and sullivan operas including the popular der mikado there is even a german version of the grand duke some german translations were made by friedrich zell and richard genée librettists of die fledermaus eine nacht in venedig and other viennese operettas who even translated one of sullivan s lesser known operas the chieftain as

karlheinz stockhausen was a german composer widely acknowledged by critics as one of the most important but also controversial composers of the twentieth and early twenty first centuries another critic calls him one of the great visionaries of 20th century music he is known for his ground breaking work in electronic music aleatory in serial composition and musical spatialization he was educated at the hochschule für musik köln and the university of cologne and later studied with olivier messiaen in paris and with werner meyer eppler at the university of bonn one of the leading figures of the darmstadt school his compositions and theories were and remain widely influential not only on composers of art music but also on jazz and popular music artists his works composed over a period of nearly sixty years eschew traditional forms in addition to electronic music both with and without live performers they range from miniatures for musical boxes through works for solo

79 on 5 december 2007 at his home in kürten germany stockhausen was born in the burg mödrath the so called castle of the village of mödrath which served at the time as the maternity home of the bergheim kreis the village located near kerpen in the vicinity of cologne was displaced in 1956 by the strip mining of lignite in the region though the castle itself still exists his father was a schoolteacher and his mother was the daughter of a prosperous family of farmers in neurath in the cologne bight she played the piano and accompanied her own singing but after three pregnancies in as many years experienced a mental breakdown and was institutionalized in december 1932 followed a few months later by the death of her younger son hermann from the age of seven stockhausen grew up in altenberg where he received his first piano lessons from the protestant organist of the altenberg cathedral franz josef kloth his father simon stockhausen remarried in 1938 and with his new wife luzia had two daughters because his relationship with his new stepmother was less than happy in january 1942 he became a boarder at the teachers training college in xanten where he continued his piano training and also studied oboe and violin according to one source as a young teenager he worked as a cobbler in 1941 or 1942 he learned that his mother had died ostensibly from leukemia though everyone at the same hospital had supposedly died of the same disease it was generally understood that she had been a victim of the nazi policy of euthanasia for useless eaters later stockhausen dramatised his mother s death in hospital by lethal injection in act 1 scene 2 of the opera donnerstag aus licht in the autumn of 1944 he was conscripted to serve as a stretcher bearer in bedburg in february 1945 he met his father for the last time in altenberg simon who was on leave from the front told his son i m not coming back look after things from 1947 to 1951 stockhausen studied music pedagogy and piano at the hochschule für musik köln and musicology philosophy and germanics at the university of cologne he had the usual training in harmony and counterpoint the latter with hermann schroeder but he did not develop a real interest in composition until 1950 he was admitted at the end of that year to the class of the swiss composer frank martin who had just begun a seven year tenure in cologne at the darmstädter ferienkurse in 1951 stockhausen met the belgian composer karel goeyvaerts who had just completed studies with olivier messiaen and darius milhaud in paris and stockhausen resolved to do likewise he arrived in paris on 8 january 1952 and began attending messiaen s courses in aesthetics and analysis as well as milhaud s composition classes he continued with messiaen for a year but was disappointed with milhaud and abandoned his lessons after a few weeks in march 1953 he left paris to take up a position as assistant to herbert eimert at the newly established electronic music studio of nordwestdeutscher rundfunk in cologne in 1962 he would succeeded eimert as director of the studio from 1954 to 1956 he studied phonetics acoustics and

married doris andreae together they had four children suja christel markus and majella on 3 april 1967 in san francisco he married mary bauermeister with whom he had two children julika and simon four of stockhausen s children became professional musicians and he composed some of his works specifically for them a large number of pieces for the trumpet from sirius to the trumpet version of in freundschaft were composed for and premièred by his son markus markus at the age of 4 years had performed the part of the child in the cologne première of originale alternating performances with his sister christel klavierstück xii and klavierstück xiii were written for his daughter majella and were first performed by her at the ages of 16 and 20 respectively the saxophone duet in the second act of donnerstag aus licht and a number of synthesizer parts in the licht operas including klavierstück xv from dienstag were composed for his son simon who also assisted his father in the production of the electronic music from freitag aus licht his daughter christel is a flautist who performed and gave a course on interpretation of tierkreis in 1977 later published as an article in 1961 stockhausen acquired a parcel of land in the vicinity of kürten a village east of cologne near bergisch gladbach in the bergisches land he had a house built there which was designed to his specifications by the architect erich schneider wessling and he resided there since its completion in the autumn of 1965 after lecturing at the internationale ferienkurse für neue musik at darmstadt stockhausen gave lectures and concerts in europe north america and asia he was guest professor of composition at the university of pennsylvania in 1965 and at the university of california davis in 1966 67 he founded and directed the cologne courses for new music from 1963 to 1968 and was appointed professor of composition at the hochschule für musik köln in 1971 where he taught until 1977 in 1998 he founded the stockhausen courses which are held annually in kürten ever since the mid 1950s stockhausen had been developing concepts of spatialization in his works not only in electronic music such as the 5 channel gesang der jünglinge and telemusik and 4 channel kontakte and hymnen instrumental vocal works like gruppen for three orchestras and carré for four choirs and orchestras also exhibit this trait in lectures such as music in space from 1958 he called for new kinds of concert halls to be built suited to the requirements of spatial music his idea wasa spherical space which is fitted all around with loudspeakers in the middle of this spherical space a sound permeable transparent platform would be suspended for the listeners they could hear music composed for such standardized spaces coming from above from below and from all points of the compass in 1968 the west german government invited stockhausen to collaborate on the german pavilion at the 1970 world fair in osaka and with the artist otto piene to create a joint multimedia project for it other collaborators on the project included the pavilion s architect fritz bornemann fritz winckel director of the electronic music studio at the technical university of berlin and the engineer max mengeringhausen the pavilion theme was gardens of music in keeping with which bornemann intended planting the exhibition halls beneath a broad lawn with only a connected auditorium sprouting above ground initially bornemann conceived this auditorium in the form of an amphitheatre with a central orchestra podium and surrounding audience space in the summer of 1968 stockhausen met with bornemann and persuaded him to change this conception to a spherical space with the audience in the center surrounded by loudspeaker groups in seven rings at different latitudes around the interior walls of the sphere photos and architectural plans of the auditorium of the west german pavilion and its sound system though stockhausen and piene s planned multimedia project titled hinab hinauf was developed in considerable detail the world fair committee rejected their concept as too extravagant and instead asked stockhausen to present daily five hour programs of his music stockhausen s works were performed for 5½ hours every day over a period of 183 days to a total audience of about a million listeners according to stockhausen s biographer michael kurtz many visitors felt the spherical auditorium to be an oasis of calm amidst the general hubbub and after a while it became one of the main attractions of expo 1970 more photos of the spherical auditorium at expo 70from the mid 1950s onward stockhausen designed his own musical scores for his publisher universal edition which often involved unconventional devices the score for his piece refrain for instance includes a rotatable on a transparent plastic strip early in the 1970s he ended his agreement with universal edition and began publishing his own scores under the stockhausen verlag imprint this arrangement allowed him to extend his notational innovations are coded in colour and resulted in eight german music publishers society awards between 1992 and 2005 in the early 1990s stockhausen reacquired the licenses to most of the recordings of his music he had made to that point and started his own record company to make this music permanently available on compact disc stockhausen died of sudden heart failure on the morning of 5 december 2007 in kürten north rhine westphalia he had just the night before finished a work recently commissioned for performance by the mozart orchestra of bologna stockhausen wrote 370 individual works he often departs radically from musical tradition and his work is influenced by olivier messiaen edgard varèse and anton webern as well as by film and by painters such as piet mondrian and paul klee stockhausen began to compose in earnest only during his third year at the conservatory his early student compositions remained out of the public eye until in 1971 he published chöre für doris drei lieder for alto voice and chamber orchestra choral for a capella choir and a sonatine for violin and piano in august 1951 just after his first darmstadt visit stockhausen began working with a form of athematic serial composition that rejected the twelve tone technique of schoenberg he characterized many of these earliest compositions as punktuelle musik though one critic concluded after analysing several of these early works that stockhausen never really composed punctually compositions from this phase include kreuzspiel the klavierstücke i iv and the first versions of punkte and kontra punkte however several works from these same years show stockhausen formulating his first really ground breaking contribution to the theory and above all practice of composition that of group composition found in stockhausen s works as early as 1952 and continuing to the present time this principle was first publicly described by stockhausen in a radio talk from december 1955 titled gruppenkomposition klavierstück i in december 1952 he composed a konkrete etüde realized in pierre schaeffer s paris musique concrète studio in march 1953 he moved to the nwdr studio in cologne and turned to electronic music with two electronic studies and then introducing spatial placements of sound sources with his mixed concrète and electronic work gesang der jünglinge experiences gained from the studies made plain that it was an unacceptable oversimplification to regard timbres as stable entities reinforced by his studies with meyer eppler beginning in 1955 stockhausen formulated new statistical criteria for composition focussing attention on the aleatoric directional tendencies of sound movement the change from one state to another with or without returning motion as opposed to a fixed state stockhausen later wrote describing this period in his compositional work the first revolution occurred from 1952 53 as musique concrète electronic tape music and space music entailing composition with transformers generators modulators magnetophones etc the integration of all concrete and abstract sound possibilities and the controlled projection of sound in space his position as the leading german composer of his generation was established with gesang der jünglinge and three concurrently composed pieces in different media zeitmasze for five woodwinds gruppen for three orchestras and klavierstück xi the principles underlying the latter three compositions are presented in stockhausen s best known theoretical article  wie die zeit vergeht  first published in 1957 in vol 3 of die reihe his work with electronic music and its utter fixity led him to explore modes of instrumental and vocal music in which performers individual capabilities and the circumstances of a particular performance may determine certain aspects of a composition he called this variable form in other cases a work may be presented from a number of different perspectives in zyklus for example he began using graphical notation for instrumental music the score is written so that the performance can start on any page and it may be read upside down or from right to left as the performer chooses still other works permit different routes through the constituent parts stockhausen called both of these possibilities polyvalent form which may be either open form as with klavierstück xi or closed form as with momente in many of his works elements are played off against one another simultaneously and successively in kontra punkte which in its revised form became his official opus 1 a process leading from an initial point texture of isolated notes toward a florid ornamental ending is opposed by a tendency from diversity toward uniformity in gruppen fanfares and passages of varying speed are occasionally flung between three full orchestras giving the impression of movement in space in his kontakte for electronic sounds he achieved for the first time an isomorphism of the four parameters of pitch duration dynamics and timbre in 1960 stockhausen returned to the composition of vocal music with carré for four choirs and four orchestras two years later he began an expansive cantata titled momente for solo soprano four choir groups and thirteen instrumentalists in 1963 stockhausen created plus minus 2 7 pages for realisation containing basic note materials and a complex system of transformations to which those materials are to be subjected in order to produce an unlimited number of different compositions through the rest of the 1960s he continued to explore such possibilities of process composition in works for live performance such as prozession kurzwellen and spiral culminating in the verbally described intuitive music compositions of aus den sieben tagen and für kommende zeiten some of his later works such as ylem and the first three parts of herbstmusik also fall under this rubric several of these process compositions were featured in the all day programmes presented at expo 70 for which stockhausen composed two more similar pieces pole for two players and expo for three in other compositions such as stop for orchestra adieu for wind quintet and the dr k sextett which was written in 1968 69 in honour of alfred kalmus of universal edition he presented his performers with more restricted improvisational possibilities he pioneered live electronics in mixtur for orchestra and electronics mikrophonie i for tam tam two microphones two filters with potentiometers mikrophonie ii for choir hammond organ and four ring modulators and solo for a melody instrument with feedback improvisation also plays a part in all of these works but especially in solo he also composed two electronic works for tape telemusik and hymnen the latter also exists in a version with partially improvising soloists and the third of its four regions in a version with orchestra at this time stockhausen also began to incorporate pre existent music from world traditions into his compositions telemusik was the first overt example of this trend in 1968 stockhausen composed the vocal sextet stimmung for the collegium vocale köln an hour long work based entirely on the overtones of a low b flat in the following year he created fresco for four orchestral groups a wandelmusik composition this was intended to be played for about five hours in the foyers and grounds of the beethovenhalle auditorium complex in bonn before after and during a group of concerts of his music in the auditoriums of the facility the overall project was given the title musik für die beethovenhalle this had precedents in two collective composition seminar projects that stockhausen gave at darmstadt in 1967 and 1968 ensemble and musik für ein haus and would have successors in the park music composition for five spatially separated groups sternklang of 1971 the orchestral work trans composed in the same year and the thirteen simultaneous musical scenes for soloists and duets titled alphabet für liège beginning with mantra for two pianos and electronics stockhausen turned to formula composition a technique which involves the projection and multiplication of a single double or triple melodic line formula sometimes as in mantra and the large orchestral composition with mime soloists inori the simple formula is stated at the outset as an introduction he continued to use this technique and der kleine harlekin of 1975 and the orchestral jubiläum of 1977 through the completion of the opera cycle licht in 2003 some works from the 1970s did not employ formula technique e g the vocal duet am himmel wandre ich  laub und regen the unaccompanied clarinet composition amour and the choral opera atmen gibt das leben but nevertheless share its simpler melodically oriented style two such pieces tierkreis and in freundschaft have become stockhausen s most widely performed and recorded compositions this dramatic simplification of style provided a model for a new generation of german composers loosely associated under the label neue einfachheit or new simplicity the best known of these composers is wolfgang rihm who studied with stockhausen in 1972 73 his orchestral composition sub kontur quotes the formula of stockhausen s inori and he has also acknowledged the influence of momente on this work other large works from this decade include the orchestral trans and two music theatre compositions utilizing the tierkreis melodies musik im bauch for six percussionists and the science fiction opera sirius for eight channel electronic music with soprano bass trumpet and bass clarinet which has four different versions for the four seasons each lasting over an hour and a half between 1977 and 2003 he composed seven operas in a cycle titled licht die sieben tage der woche the licht cycle deals with the traits associated in various historical traditions with each weekday and with the relationships between and among three archetypal characters michael lucifer and eve each of these characters dominates one of the operas samstag and montag respectively the three possible pairings are foregrounded in three others and the equal combination of all three is featured in mittwoch stockhausen s conception of opera was based significantly on ceremony and ritual with influence from the japanese noh theatre as well as judeo christian and vedic traditions similarly his approach to voice and text sometimes departed from traditional usage characters were as likely to be portrayed by instrumentalists or dancers as by singers and a few parts of licht use written or improvised texts in simulated or invented languages the seven operas were not composed in weekday order but rather starting with the solo operas and working toward the more complex ones donnerstag samstag montag dienstag freitag mittwoch and finally sonntag stockhausen had dreams of flying throughout his life and these dreams are reflected in the helikopter streichquartett completed in 1993 in it the four members of a string quartet perform in four helicopters flying independent flight paths over the countryside near the concert hall the sounds they play are mixed together with the sounds of the helicopters and played through speakers to the audience in the hall videos of the performers are also transmitted back to the concert hall the performers are synchronized with the aid of a click track transmitted to them and heard over headphones the first performance of the piece took place in amsterdam on 26 june 1995 as part of the holland festival despite its extremely unusual nature the piece has been given several performances including one on 22 august 2003 as part of the salzburg festival to open the hangar 7 venue and the german première on 17 june 2007 in braunschweig as part of the stadt der wissenschaft 2007 festival the work has also been recorded by the arditti quartet after completing licht stockhausen embarked on a new cycle of compositions based on the hours of the day entitled klang twenty one of these pieces were completed before the composer s death the works from this cycle performed to date are first hour himmelfahrt for organ or synthesizer soprano and tenor second hour freude for two harps third hour natürliche dauern for

fourteenth and nineteenth have been announced for 10 january 2009 in paris and 8 november 2008 in london respectively in the 1950s and early 1960s stockhausen published a series of articles that established his importance in the area of music theory although these include analyses of music by mozart debussy bartók stravinsky goeyvaerts boulez nono johannes fritsch michael von biel and especially webern the items on compositional theory directly related to his own work are regarded as the most important generally indeed the texte come closer than anything else currently available to providing a general compositional theory for the postwar period his most celebrated article is wie die zeit vergeht  first published in the third volume of die reihe in it he expounds a number of temporal conceptions underlying his instrumental compositions zeitmaße gruppen and klavierstück xi in particular this article develops a scale of twelve tempos analogous to the chromatic pitch scale a technique of building progressively smaller integral subdivisions over a basic duration analogous to the overtone series musical application of the concept of the partial field in both successive and simultaneous proportions methods of projecting large scale form from a series of proportions the concept of statistical composition the concept of action duration and the associated variable form and the notion of the directionless temporal field and with it polyvalent form other important articles from this period include musik im raum  musik und graphik  momentform  die einheit der musikalischen zeit and erfindung und entdeckung the last summing up the ideas developed up to 1961 taken together these temporal theoriessuggested that the entire compositional structure could be conceived as timbre since the different experienced components such as color harmony and melody meter and rhythm dynamics and form correspond to the different segmental ranges of this unified time the total musical result at any given compositional level is simply the spectrum of a more basic duration i e its timbre perceived as the overall effect of the overtone structure of that duration now taken to include not only the rhythmic subdivisions of the duration but also their relative dynamic strength envelope etc  compositionally considered this produced a change of focus from the individual tone to a whole complex of tones related to one another by virtue of their relation to a fundamental a change that was probably the most important compositional development of the latter part of the 1950s not only for stockhausen s music but for advanced music in general some of these ideas considered from a purely theoretical point of view drew significant critical fire for this reason stockhausen ceased publishing such articles for a number of years as he felt that many useless polemics about these texts had arisen and he preferred to concentrate his attention on composing through the 1960s although he taught and lectured publicly stockhausen published little of an analytical or theoretical nature only in 1970 did he again begin publishing theoretical articles with kriterien his six seminar lectures for the darmstädter ferienkurse stockhausen s two early electronic studies had a powerful influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s particularly in the work of the italian franco evangelisti and the poles andrzej dobrowolski and włodzimierz kotoński the influence of his kontra punkte zeitmasse and gruppen may be seen in the work of many composers including igor stravinsky s threni and movements for piano and orchestra and other works up to the variations aldous huxley in memoriam whose rhythms are likely to have been inspired at least in part by certain passages from stockhausen s gruppen though music of stockhausen s generation may seem an unlikely influence stravinsky said in a 1957 conversation i have all around me the spectacle of composers who after their generation has had its decade of influence and fashion seal themselves off from further development and from the next generation of course it requires greater effort to learn from one s juniors and their manners are not invariably good but when you are seventy five and your generation has overlapped with four younger ones it behooves you not to decide in advance how far composers can go but to try to discover whatever new thing it is makes the new generation new amongst british composers sir harrison birtwistle readily acknowledges the influence of stockhausen s zeitmaße and gruppen on his work more generally brian ferneyhough says that although the technical and speculative innovations of klavierstücke i iv kreuzspiel and kontra punkte escaped him on first encounter they nevertheless produced a sharp emotion the result of a beneficial shock engendered by their boldness and provided an important source of motivation for my own investigations while still in school he became fascinated upon hearing the british première of gruppen andlistened many times to the recording of this performance while trying to penetrate its secrets how it always seemed to be about to explode but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core but scarcely managed to grasp it retrospectively it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today with respect to stockhausen s later work he said i have never subscribed to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing stockhausen s development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth on the contrary it seems to me that the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time  i doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who even if for a short time did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of stockhausen in a short essay describing stockhausen s influence on his own work richard barrett concludes that stockhausen remains the composer whose next work i look forward most to hearing apart from myself of course and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking mantra gruppen carré klavierstück x inori and jubiläum french composer jean claude éloy regards stockhausen as the most important composer of the second half of the twentieth century and cites virtually all his catalog of works as a powerful discoveration and a true revelation dutch composer louis andriessen acknowledged the influence of stockhausen s momente in his pivotal work contra tempus of 1968 german composer wolfgang rihm who studied with stockhausen was influenced by momente hymnen and inori jazz musicians such as miles davis cecil taylor charles mingus herbie hancock yusef lateef and anthony braxton cite stockhausen as an influence at the cologne iscm festival in 1960 the danish composer per nørgård heard stockhausen s kontakte as well as pieces by kagel boulez and berio he was profoundly affected by what he heard and his music suddenly changed into a far more discontinuous and disjunct style involving elements of strict organization in all parameters some degree of aleatoricism and controlled improvisation together with an interest in collage from other musics stockhausen was influential within pop and rock music as well frank zappa acknowledges stockhausen in the liner notes of freak out his 1966 debut with the mothers of invention rick wright and roger waters of pink floyd also acknowledge stockhausen as an influence san francisco psychedelic groups jefferson airplane and the grateful dead are vaguely said to have done the same though stockhausen himself merely says the former band included students of luciano berio and both were well orientated toward new music founding members of cologne based experimental band can irmin schmidt and holger czukay state they studied with stockhausen and this is confirmed to have been from 1963 to 1966 at the cologne courses for new music german electronic pioneers kraftwerk also say they studied with stockhausen and icelandic vocalist björk has acknowledged stockhausen s influence stockhausen along with john cage is one of the few avant garde composers to have succeeded in penetrating the popular consciousness the beatles famously included his face on the cover of sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band this reflects his influence on the band s own avant garde experiments as well as the general fame and notoriety he had achieved by that time in particular a day in the life and revolution 9 1968 were influenced by stockhausen s electronic music stockhausen s name and the perceived strangeness and unlistenability of his music was even a punchline in cartoons as documented on a page on the official stockhausen web site perhaps the most caustic remark about stockhausen was attributed to sir thomas beecham asked have you heard any stockhausen he is alleged to have replied no but i believe i have trodden in some stockhausen s fame is also reflected in works of literature for example he is mentioned in philip k dick s 1974 novel flow my tears the policeman said and in thomas pynchon s 1966 novel the crying of lot 49 the pynchon novel features the scope a bar with a strict electronic music policy protagonist oedipa maas asks a hip graybeard about a sudden chorus of whoops and yibbles coming out of a kind of jukebox he replies that s by stockhausen the early crowd tends to dig your radio cologne sound later on we really swing robin maconie finds that compared to the work of his contemporaries stockhausen s music has a depth and rational integrity that is quite outstanding  his researches initially guided by meyer eppler have a coherence unlike any other composer then or since maconie also compares stockhausen to beethoven if a genius is someone whose ideas survive all attempts at explanation then by that definition stockhausen is the nearest thing to beethoven this century has produced reason his music lasts and as stravinsky said one never thinks of beethoven as a superb orchestrator because the quality of invention transcends mere craftsmanship it is the same with stockhausen the intensity of imagination gives rise to musical impressions of an elemental and seemingly unfathomable beauty arising from necessity rather than conscious design christopher ballantine while comparing and contrasting the categories of experimental and avant garde music concludes thatperhaps more than any other contemporary composer stockhausen exists at the point where the dialectic between experimental and avant garde music becomes manifest it is in him more obviously than anywhere else that these diverse approaches converge this alone would seem to suggest his remarkable significance igor stravinsky expressed great but not uncritical enthusiasm for stockhausen s music in the conversation books with robert craft and for years organised private listening sessions with friends in his home where he played tapes of stockhausen s latest works in an interview published in march 1968 however he says of an unidentified person i have been listening all week to the piano music of a composer now greatly esteemed for his ability to stay an hour or so ahead of his time but i find the alternation of note clumps and silences of which it consists more monotonous than the foursquares of the dullest eighteenth century music 1968 4 the following october a report in sovetskaia muzyka translated this sentence into russian substituting for the conjunction but the phrase ia imeiu v vidu karlkheintsa shtokkhauzena when this translation was quoted in druskin s stravinsky biography the field was widened to all of stockhausen s compositions and druskin adds for good measure indeed works he calls unnecessary useless and uninteresting again quoting from the same sovetskaia muzyka article even though it had made plain that the characterization was of american university composers early in 1995 bbc radio 3 sent stockhausen a package of recordings from contemporary artists aphex twin plastikman scanner and daniel pemberton and asked him for his opinion on the music in august of that year radio 3 reporter dick witts interviewed stockhausen about these pieces for a broadcast in october subsequently published in the november issue of the british publication the wire asking what advice he would give these young musicians stockhausen made suggestions to each of the musicians who were then invited to respond all but plastikman obliged in a press conference in hamburg on 16 september 2001 stockhausen was asked by a journalist whether the characters in licht were for him merely some figures out of a common cultural history or rather material appearances the composer replied i pray daily to michael but not to lucifer i have renounced him but he is very much present like in new york recently the same journalist then asked how the events of september 11th had affected him and how he viewed reports of the attack in connection with the harmony of humanity represented in hymnen he answered well what happened there is of course now all of you must adjust your brains the biggest work of art there has ever been the fact that spirits achieve with one act something which we in music could never dream of that people practise ten years madly fanatically for a concert and then die and that is the greatest work of art that exists for the whole cosmos just imagine what happened there there are people who are so concentrated on this single performance and then five thousand people are driven to resurrection in one moment i couldn t do that compared to that we are nothing as composers it is a crime you know of course because the people did not agree to it they did not come to the concert that is obvious and nobody had told them you could be killed in the process as a result of the reaction to the press report of stockhausen s comments a four day festival of his work in hamburg was canceled in addition his pianist daughter announced to the press that she would no longer appear under the name stockhausen in a subsequent message he stated that the press had published false defamatory reports about his comments and clarified as follows at the press conference in hamburg i was asked if michael eve and lucifer were historical figures of the past and i answered that they exist now for example lucifer in new york in my work i have defined lucifer as the cosmic spirit of rebellion of anarchy he uses his high degree of intelligence to destroy creation he does not know love after further questions about the events in america i said that such a plan appeared to be lucifer s greatest work of art of course i used the designation work of art to mean the work of destruction personified in lucifer in the context of my other comments this was unequivocal amongst the numerous honors and distinctions that were bestowed upon stockhausen are 
thomas alan waits is an american singer songwriter composer and actor waits has a distinctive voice described by critic daniel durchholz as sounding like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car with this trademark growl his incorporation of pre rock music styles such as blues jazz and vaudeville and experimental tendencies verging on industrial music waits has built up a distinctive musical persona he has worked as a composer for movies and musical plays and as a supporting actor in films including down by law the fisher king coffee cigarettes bram stoker s dracula and short cuts he was nominated for an academy award for his soundtrack work on one from the heart lyrically waits s songs frequently present atmospheric portrayals of grotesque often seedy characters and places although he has also shown a penchant for more conventional ballads he has a cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters despite having little radio or music video support his songs are best known to the general public in the form of cover versions by more visible artists for example jersey girl performed by bruce springsteen downtown train performed by rod stewart and ol 55 performed by the eagles although waits albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native united states they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries he has been nominated for a number of major music awards and has won grammy awards for two albums bone machine and mule variations waits currently lives in sonoma county california with his wife and three children tom waits was born at park avenue hospital in pomona california to jesse frank waits and alma johnson mcmurray both schoolteachers his father was of scots irish descent and his mother from norwegian stock after waits s parents divorced in 1960 he lived with his mother in whittier california and then moved to national city in san diego county near the mexican border waits who taught himself how to play the piano on a neighbor s instrument often took trips to mexico with his father who taught spanish he would later claim that he found his love of music during these trips through a mexican ballad that was probably a ranchera you know on the car radio with my dad by 1965 while attending the hilltop high school within the sweetwater union high school district chula vista waits was playing in an r b soul band called the system and had begun his first job at napoleone pizza house in national city from small change and the ghosts of saturday night on the heart of saturday night he later admitted that he was not a fan of the 1960s music scene stating i wasn t thrilled by blue cheer so i found an alternative even if it was bing crosby five years later he was working as a doorman at the heritage nightclub in san diego where artists of every genre performed when he did his first paid gig for 25 a fan of frank sinatra bob dylan lord buckley hoagy carmichael marty robbins raymond chandler and stephen foster waits began developing his own idiosyncratic musical style combining song and monologue after serving with the u s coast guard he took his newly formed act to monday nights at the troubadour in los angeles where musicians would line up all day for the opportunity to perform on stage that night in 1971 waits moved to the echo park neighborhood of los angeles and signed with herb cohen at the age of 21 from august to december 1971 waits made a series of demo recordings for cohen s bizarre straight label including many songs for which he would later become known these early tracks were eventually to be released twenty years later on the early years volume one and volume two waits signed to asylum records in 1972 and after numerous abortive recording sessions his first record the jazzy folk tinged closing time was released in 1973 the album which was produced and arranged by former lovin spoonful member jerry yester received positive reviews but waits did not gain widespread attention until a number of the album s tracks were covered by more prominent artists later in 1973 tim buckley released the album sefronia which contained a cover of waits song martha from closing time the first ever cover of a tom waits song by a known artist the album s opening track ol 55 was recorded by his labelmates the eagles in 1974 for their on the border album he began touring and opening for such artists as charlie rich martha and the vandellas and frank zappa waits received increasing critical acclaim and gathered a loyal cult following with his subsequent albums the heart of saturday night featuring the song the heart of saturday night revealed waits s roots as a nightclub performer with half spoken and half crooned ballads often accompanied by a jazz backup band waits described the album as a comprehensive study of a number of aspects of this search for the center of saturday night which jack kerouac relentlessly chased from one end of this country to the other and i ve attempted to scoop up a few diamonds of this magic that i see in 1975 waits moved to the tropicana motel on santa monica boulevard and released the double album nighthawks at the diner recorded in a studio with a small audience in order to capture the ambience of a live show the record exemplifies this phase of his career including the lengthy spoken interludes between songs that punctuated his live act that year he also contributed backing vocals to bonnie raitt s sweet and shiny eyes from her album home plate by this time waits was drinking heavily and life on the road was starting to take its toll waits looking back at the period has said i was sick through that whole period it was starting to wear on me all the touring i d been traveling quite a bit living in hotels eating bad food drinking a lot too much there s a lifestyle that s there before you arrive and you re introduced to it it s unavoidable in reaction to these hardships waits recorded small change which finds him in a much more cynical and pessimistic mood lyrically with many songs such as the piano has been drinking and bad liver and a broken heart with the album waits asserted that he tried to resolve a few things as far as this cocktail lounge maudlin crying in your beer image that i have there ain t nothin funny about a drunk i was really starting to believe that there was something amusing and wonderfully american about being a drunk i ended up telling myself to cut that shit out the album which also included long time fan favorite tom traubert s blues featured famed drummer shelly manne and was like his previous albums heavily influenced by jazz small change which was accompanied by the double a side single step right up the piano has been drinking was a critical and commercial success and far outsold any of waits s previous albums with it waits broke onto billboard s top 100 albums chart for the first time in his career this resulted in a much higher public profile which brought with it interviews and articles in time newsweek and vogue waits put together a regular touring band the nocturnal emissions which featured frank vicari on tenor saxophone fitzgerald jenkins on bass and chip white on drums and vibraphone tom waits and the nocturnal emissions toured the united states and europe extensively from october 1976 until may 1977 including a performance of the piano has been drinking on cult bbc2 television music show the old grey whistle test in may 1976 foreign affairs was musically in a similar vein to small change but showed further artistic refinement and exploration into jazz and blues styles particularly noteworthy is the long cinematic spoken word piece potter s field set to an orchestral score the album also features bette midler singing a duet with waits on i never talk to strangers the album blue valentine displayed waits s biggest musical departure to date with much more focus on electric guitar and keyboards than on previous albums and nearly no strings for a darker more blues oriented sound the song blue valentines was also unique for waits in that it featured a desolate arrangement of solo electric guitar played by ray crawford accompanied by waits vocal around this time waits had a high profile romantic relationship with rickie lee jones in 1978 waits also appeared in his first film role in paradise alley as mumbles the pianist and contributed the original compositions paradise alley and annie s back in town to the film s soundtrack heartattack and vine waits s last studio album for asylum was released in 1980 featuring a developing sound that included both ballads and rougher edged rhythm and blues the same year he began a long working relationship with francis ford coppola who asked waits to provide music for his film one from the heart for coppola s film waits originally wanted to work with bette midler she was unavailable due to prior engagements however waits ended up working with singer songwriter crystal gayle as his vocal foil for the album in august 1980 waits married kathleen brennan whom he had met on the set of one from the heart brennan is regularly credited as coauthor of many songs in his later albums and waits often cites her as a major influence on his work she introduced him to the music of captain beefheart despite having shared a manager with beefheart in the 1970s waits says i became more acquainted with him when i got married waits would later describe his relationship with brennan as a paradigm shift in his musical development after leaving asylum the label released the first tom waits best of album in 1981 a collection called bounced checks notable for including an alternate stripped down version of jersey girl and the otherwise unreleased mr henry as well as an alternate master of whistlin past the graveyard and a live performance of the piano has been drinking in the few years before waits would re emerge with his new musical style he appeared in a series of minor movie roles including a cameo in wolfen as an inebriated piano player one from the heart received its official theatrical release in 1982 with waits appearing in a cameo as a trumpet player as well as receiving an oscar nomination for original song score this marked the first in a series of collaborations between waits and coppola with waits appearing in cameos in coppola s movies the outsiders rumble fish and the cotton club after leaving asylum for island records waits released swordfishtrombones in 1983 a record that marked a sharp turn in his musical direction while waits had before played either piano or guitar he now gravitated towards less common instruments saying your hands are like dogs going to the same places they ve been you have to be careful when playing is no longer in the mind but in the fingers going to happy places you have to break them of their habits or you don t explore you only play what is confident and pleasing i m learning to break those habits by playing instruments i know absolutely nothing about like a bassoon or a waterphone swordfishtrombones also introduced instruments such as bagpipes and marimba to waits repertoire as well as pump organs percussion horn sections experimental guitar and obsolete instruments his songwriting shifted as well moving away from the traditional piano and strings ballad sound of his 1970s output towards a number of styles largely ignored in pop music including primal blues cabaret stylings rumbas theatrical approaches in the style of kurt weill tango music early country music and european folk music as well as the tin pan alley era songs that influenced his early output he also recorded a spoken word piece frank s wild years influenced by ken nordine s word jazz records of the 1950s apart from captain beefheart and some of dr john s early output there was little precedent in popular music waits s new emphasis on experimenting with various styles and instrumentation continued on 1985 s rain dogs a sprawling 19 song collection which received glowing reviews contributions from guitarists marc ribot robert quine and keith richards contributed to waits move away from piano based songs in juxtaposition with an increased emphasis on instruments such as marimba accordion double bass trombone and banjo the album also spawned the 12 single downtown train tango till they re sore jockey full of bourbon with jean baptiste mondino filming a promotional music video for downtown train featuring a cameo from boxing legend jake la motta the album peaked at 188 on billboard s top 200 albums chart however its reputation has come to far outshine low initial sales frank s wild years a musical play by waits and brennan was staged as an off broadway musical in 1986 directed by gary sinise in a successful run at chicago s famed steppenwolf theater waits himself played the lead role waits developed his acting career with several supporting roles and a lead role in jim jarmusch s down by law in 1986 which also featured two of waits s songs from rain dogs in the soundtrack in the same year waits also contributed piano and vocals to the song sleep tonight on the rolling stones album dirty work in 1987 he released franks wild years which included studio versions from waits play of the same name rolling stone summed up the album s myriad styles this way everything from sleazy strip show blues to cheesy waltzes to supercilious lounge lizardry is given spare jarring arrangements using various combinations of squawking horns bashed drums plucked banjo snaky double bass carnival organ and jaunty accordion waits also continued to further his acting career with a supporting role as rudy the kraut in ironweed alongside jack nicholson and meryl streep in which waits performed the song big rock candy mountain as well as a part in robert frank s candy mountain in which waits also performed once more before i go in 1988 waits performed in big time a surreal concert movie and soundtrack which he cowrote with his wife in 1989 waits appeared in his final theatrical stage role to date appearing as curly in thomas babe s demon wine alongside bill pullman philip baker hall carol kane and bud cort the play opened at the los angeles theater center in february 1989 to mixed reviews although waits performance was singled out by a number of critics including john c mahoney who described his performance as mesmerizing waits finished the decade with appearances in three movies as the voice of a radio dj in jim jarmusch s mystery train as kenny the hitman in robert dornheim s cold feet and the lead role of punch judy man silva in bearskin an urban fairytale his only musical output of the year consisted of contributing his cover of phil phillips sea of love to the soundtrack of the al pacino movie of the same name and contributing vocals to the replacements song date to church which appeared as a b side to their single i ll be you the black rider the casting of the magic bullets a theatrical collaboration of waits

music business which sold over a million copies worldwide jim jarmusch directed a promotional music video for the song waits also collaborated with photographer sylvia plachy in the same year her book

devout catalyst an album by one of waits greatest influences ken nordine on the songs a thousand bing bangs and the movie waits also contributed vocals to a duet with singer bob forrest on the song adios lounge on the thelonious monster album beautiful mess he also contributed vocals to two songs on jazz tenor saxophonist teddy edwards album mississippi lad edwards was extremely complimentary of waits contributions saying tom waits is the one who got me my conract with polygram he s wonderful he s america s best lyricist since johnny mercer he came down to the studio on the mississippi lad album that s the first one i did for polygram and he sang two of my songs wouldn t accept any money just trying to give me the best boost that he could the only collection of exclusively waits performed material of 1991 appeared when waits composed and conducted the almost exclusively instrumental music for jim jarmusch s 1991 film night on earth which was released as an album the following

s first studio album in five years was released in 1992 the stark record featured a great deal of percussion and guitar marking another change in waits sound critic steve huey calls it perhaps tom waits s most cohesive album a morbid sinister nightmare one that applied the quirks of his experimental 80s classics to stunningly evocative and often harrowing effect waits most affecting and powerful recording even if it isn t his most accessible bone machine was awarded a grammy in the best alternative album category on december 19 1992 alice waits s second theatrical project with robert wilson premiered at the thalia theatre in hamburg paul schmidt adapted the text from the works of lewis carroll with songs by waits and kathleen brennan presented as intersections with the text rather than as expansions of the story as would be the case in conventional musical theater these songs would be recorded by waits as a studio album 10 years later on alice 1992 also saw waits featuring in francis ford coppola s film adaptation of bram stoker s dracula as the possessed lunatic renfield in 1993 he released the black rider which contained studio versions of the songs that waits had

andy kaulkin said that the label was  blown away that tom would even consider us we are huge fans waits himself was full of praise for the label saying epitaph is rare for being owned and operated by musicians they have good taste and a load of enthusiasm plus they re nice people and they gave me a brand new cadillac of course waits s first album on his new label mule variations was issued in 1999 billboard described the album as musically melding backwoods blues skewed gospel and unruly art stomp into a sublime piece of junkyard sound sculpture the album was waits first release to feature a turntablist the album won a grammy in 2000 as an indicator of how difficult it is to classify waits s music he was nominated simultaneously for best contemporary folk album and best male rock vocal performance both different from the genre for which he won his previous grammy the album was also his highest charting album in the u s to date reaching 30 the same year waits made a foray into

improvisations it is also more rock oriented with less blues influence than he has previously demonstrated and it contains an explicitly political song a first for waits in the album closing day after tomorrow he adopts the persona of a soldier writing home that he is disillusioned with war and is thankful to be leaving the song does not mention the iraq war specifically and as tom moon writes it could be the voice of a civil war soldier singing a lonesome late night dirge waits himself does describe the song as something of an elliptical protest song about the iraqi invasion however critic thom jurek describes day after tomorrow as one of the most insightful and understated antiwar songs to have been written in decades it contains not a hint of banality or sentiment in its folksy articulation the same year waits contributed backing vocals to the track go tell it on the mountain on the grammy award winning album of the same name by the blind boys of alabama he also contributed

mainland europe waits was awarded el paso s key to the city during a concert on june 20 2008 in his generally positive review of the opening show of the tour the wall street journal critic jim fusilli described waits music thus the 58 year old mr waits  has composed a body of work that s at least comparable to any songwriter s in pop today a keen sensitive and sympathetic chronicler of the adrift and downtrodden mr waits creates three dimensional characters who even in their confusion and despair are capable of insight and startling points of view their stories are accompanied by music that s unlike any other in pop history waits latest appearance is on a hip hop album by n a s a in which he sings on the track spacious thoughts tom waits wrote this introduction for the tompkins square compilation people take warning murder ballads disaster songs 1913 1938 in the late 1920 s and early 1930 s the depression gripped the nation it was a time when songs were tools for living a whole community would turn out to mourn the loss of a member and to sow their songs like seeds this collection is a wild garden grown from those seeds waits has often switched to smaller independent record companies over the years he signed to asylum records before they were bought out by elektra records and warner bros during his time with island records that label expanded from a small company to a music industry giant he then signed to anti records a division of epitaph records waits has steadfastly refused to allow the use of his songs in commercials and has joked about other artists who do he has filed several lawsuits against advertisers who used his material without permission he has been quoted as saying apparently the highest compliment our culture grants artists nowadays is to be in an ad ideally naked and purring on the hood of a new car he said in a statement referring to the mercury cougar i have adamantly and repeatedly refused this dubious honor uncharacteristically waits once provided the voice over for a 1981 purina dog food television commercial waits filed his first lawsuit in 1988 against frito lay the 9th circuit court of appeals affirmed an award of us 2 375 million in his favor frito lay had approached waits to use one of his songs in an advertisement waits declined the offer and frito lay hired a waits soundalike to sing a jingle similar to small change s step right up which is ironically a song waits has called an indictment of advertising waits won the lawsuit becoming one of the first artists to successfully sue a company for using an impersonator without permission in 1993 levi s used screamin jay hawkins version of waits heartattack and vine in a commercial waits sued and levi s agreed to cease all use of the song and offered a full page apology in billboard waits found himself in a situation similar to his earlier one with frito lay in 2000 when audi approached him asking to use innocent when you dream for a commercial broadcast in spain waits declined but the commercial ultimately featured music very similar to that song waits undertook legal action and a spanish court recognized that there had been a violation of waits s moral rights in addition to the infringement of copyright the production company tandem campany guasch was ordered to pay compensation to waits through his spanish publisher waits was later quoted as jokingly saying the company got the name of the song wrong thinking it was called innocent when you scheme in 2005 waits sued adam opel ag claiming that after having failed to sign him to sing in their scandinavian commercials they had hired a sound alike singer in 2007 the suit was settled and waits gave the sum to charity waits has also filed a lawsuit unrelated to his music he was arrested

taken into custody and charged with disturbing the peace the jury found waits not guilty he took the police department to court and was awarded 7 500 compensation 
spectral music refers to a musical composition practice where compositional decisions are often informed by the analysis of sound spectra computer based sound spectrum analysis using a fast fourier transform is one of the more common methods used in generating descriptive data using fft analysis features of a particular sound spectrum can be visualized using a spectrogram this particular style of composition originated in france in the early 1970s and the techniques were primarily developed and later refined at institut de recherche et coordination acoustique musique paris by composers such as gerard grisey and tristan murail murail has described spectral music as an attitude towards composition rather than a set of techniques an aesthetic rather than style this attitude being that music is ultimately sound evolving in time however it has been suggested that a number of major practitioners of this compositional method consider the term inappropriate misleading and reductive the term spectral music was coined by hugues dufourt in an article published in 1979 dufourt a trained philosopher as well as composer was the author of several interesting flagship articles associated with this movement although the relationship of his own music to this trend has remained ambiguous in any case it was the better part of a decade before the term was in very wide circulation it was initially associated with composers including dufourt horatiu radulescu iancu dumitrescu gérard grisey tristan murail michael levinas and the late claude vivier since the mid eighties the movement has broadened out into one of the most important contemporary compositional trends among recent composers building on the spectral idea are joshua fineberg magnus lindberg ana maria avram kaija saariaho phillippe leroux phillippe hurel and julian anderson early traces can be found in hermann von helmholtz s on the sensations of tone as a physiological basis for the theory of music early in the twentieth century ferruccio busoni published in 1907 entwurf einer neuen ästhetik der tonkunst describing microtonal music along similar lines henry cowell published in 1930 new musical resources establishing a relation between acoustics perception and composition busoni lamented the traditional music lawgivers and predicted a future music that included the division of the octave into more than the traditional 12 degrees his philosophy that music was born free and to win freedom is its destiny greatly influenced his students luigi russolo who would take part in the futurist movement and introduced noise music with his manifesto the art of noises busoni also influenced edgard varèse who played a major role in the twentieth century opening of music to all sound proto spectral composers include edgard varèse olivier messiaen györgy ligeti karlheinz stockhausen and iannis xenakis as well as andré jolivet friedrich cerha giacinto scelsi and to some degree la monte young theoretical predecessors include some of the composers mentioned and harry partch henry cowell and paul hindemith early origins can be considered also the romanian folk music as collected by bela bartok with its acoustic scales derived directly from the resonance with natural wind instruments like buciume tulnice cimpoi it inspires a lot of spectral music composers this music began to emerge in the 1970s both in france amongst the composers of the groupe de l itinéraire influenced by work of composers such as maurice ravel and olivier messiaen and in romania with composers around hyperion ensemble both of whom created harmonies and orchestrations based on the harmonic and inharmonic partials contained in complex sounds such as multiple stop organ tones bell sounds and bird song spectral music simply carries this principle much further and with more radical precision made possible with the aid of computerized fft analysis the music of scelsi with its concentration on long held single tones continuously mutating in timbre and other parameters is also another important contribution to spectral music philosophically the spectralists attitude of rigorous objectivity in the exploration of sound and the application of their discoveries to composition can be considered a continuation of traditional modernism spectral music at the time of its origin was also received as a direct affront to the claim of the serialists and post serialists to the vanguard of serious musical composition and compositional technique julian anderson considers danish composer per nørgård s voyage into the golden screen for chamber orchestra to be the first properly instrumental piece of spectral composition actually hyper spectralism seems to represent a new state of development in spectral music after harry halbreich the panoply of methods and techniques used are secondary being only the means of achieving a sonic end the composition of spectral music is concerned with timbral structures especially when decisions about timbre are informed by a mathematical analysis known as a fast fourier transform ffts can be used to provide graphs that illustrate details about the timbral structure of a sound which might not be initially apparent to the ear ffts can also be used in creating sounds with computers in order to transform the timbre of a sound in various ways such as creating hybrid timbres through a collection of processes known as cross synthesis or applying a room reverberation to a sound through a process known as convolution if the music is to be performed by live musicians then these novel effects must be translated into an extended traditional notation that can be read and executed by a human being with some additional training the fine gradations of pitch are usually rounded off to the nearest quarter tone or even eighth tone dividing the octave into 24 or 48 discrete pitches instead of the usual twelve for western music temporal aspects and dynamics are subject to similarly fine controls creating additional notational hurdles formal concepts important in spectral music include process though significantly different from those of minimalist music in that all musical parameters may be affected these processes most often achieve a smooth transition through interpolation characteristic spectral pieces include gérard grisey s partiels tristan murail s gondwana stockhausen s stimmung and jean claude risset s mutation john chowning s stria and jonathan harvey s mortuos plango vivos voco are examples of electronic pieces that embrace spectral techniques iancu dumitrescu s medium  cogito trompe l oeil movemur perspectives au movemur are examples of instrumental spectral pieces kaija saariaho s adriana mater and joshua fineberg s lolita are operas influenced by spectral techniques 
porcupine tree are a grammy award nominated progressive rock band formed by steven wilson in 1987 in hemel hempstead hertfordshire england their music is a combination of rock ambient psychedelia and metal during the nineties the band focused mainly on psychedelic music although they incorporated a wide range of styles of electronic music from trance krautrock and ambient due to steven wilson and richard barbieri s liking for the kosmische musik scene of the early 70s led by bands such as tangerine dream neu and can to more recently metal for live shows porcupine tree make use of a screen that displays a different projection for each song this visual element was introduced during the in absentia tour when the band started to work with danish photographer and film maker lasse hoile whose works help to create a distinctive image for the band despite being signed to roadrunner in europe and atlantic in the u s the band have their own record label transmission which they use to launch some independent releases and special limited editions of their albums porcupine tree have an official online store on burning shed now the official online distributor to legendary label peaceville records and to kscope porcupine tree originated in 1987 as something of a collaborative hoax between steven wilson and malcolm stocks partially inspired by psychedelic bands of the seventies in the likes of pink floyd that dominated the music scene during their youth the two decided to form a fictional legendary rock band named the porcupine tree the two fabricated details such as band members album titles and a back story that purportedly included events such as a meeting at a 70s rock festival and several trips in and out of prison as soon as he put aside enough money to buy his own studio equipment wilson obliged the creation with several hours of music to provide evidence of its existence although porcupine tree started largely as a joke and wilson was preoccupied with his other project no man by 1989 he began to consider some of the music as potentially marketable wilson created an 80 minute long cassette titled tarquin s seaweed farm under the name of porcupine tree still showing the spirit of his joke wilson included an 8 page inlay containing information about fictitious band members such as sir tarquin underspoon and timothy tadpole jones wilson sent out copies of tarquin s seaweed farm to several people he felt would be interested in the recordings the underground uk magazine freakbeat was going through the process of starting their own record company when they received the cassette the tape received mild reviews but porcupine tree was soon asked to contribute to a compilation of up and coming underground psychedelic artists this process was slow taking eighteen months before completion during this period wilson continued to work on new material and in 1990 he released the love death mussolini e p issued in a very limited run of 10 copies the ep remains an extremely rare collectible piece it was composed of nine at the time unreleased tracks as a preview for the upcoming second album the ep was followed over the same year by the nostalgia factory an album that grew porcupine tree s underground fanbase though the band still carried on the charade of being 70s rock legends the newly formed freakbeat magazine editor s record label delerium agreed to reissue the cassettes tarquin s seaweed farm and the nostalgia factory a compilation album was also released as planned under the title of a psychedelic psauna featuring the porcupine tree track linton samuel dawson wilson was invited shortly afterwards to sign with delerium as one of the label s founder artists he was originally invited to publish a double album of his two cassettes but he decided to put instead what he discerned as the best of both tapes onto a single album the album was released in mid 1991 as on the sunday of life  the rest of the music from the initial tapes was released on the limited edition compilation album yellow hedgerow dreamscape in 1992 delerium released on the sunday of life as an edition of 1 000 copies complete with a deluxe gatefold sleeve the album sold out shortly after it shipped but pressure from public and press alike ensured that it was reproduced along with a cd version the album featured future concert favourite and frequent encore song radioactive toy by 2000 on the sunday of life had racked up sales of more than 20 000 copies in the midst of porcupine tree s rising success wilson s other band no man had been getting excellent uk press which led to the band being signed to one little indian records hit run publishing in the uk and epic 440 sony in the us no man s success gave wilson the opportunity to leave his regular job and devote his time solely to music looking forward from the original porcupine tree music wilson took steps to move his project towards newer more contemporary kinds of music this new goal scored the band with their thirty minute long single voyage 34 released in 1992 the song mixed together the ambient trance music of earlier groups like the orb and future sound of london the single featured what is described as liquid rock guitar solos coupled with a narrative from a sixties lsd propaganda lp the track was too long to make it a radio hit but it got good response from the underground music scene of the nineties reaching the uk independent top 20 singles list voyage 34 was actually a track recorded for another prospective porcupine tree double album up the downstair however when the album eventually emerged in mid 1993 the decision not to include the single had slimmed down the album to a single record up the downstair was greeted with rapture melody maker describing it as a psychedelic masterpiece one of the albums of the year the album continued the fusion of dance and rock and also featured guest appearances from two future full time porcupine tree members richard barbieri and colin edwin in november 1993 voyage 34 was reissued alongside an additional 12 inch remix by astralasia with non existent radio play it still managed to enter the nme indie chart for six weeks and became an underground chill out classic the profile of porcupine tree had now grown to the extent that the question of live performances could no longer be ignored thus in december 1993 porcupine tree became a live unit featuring steven wilson on lead vocals guitar colin edwin on bass guitar chris maitland on drums and richard barbieri on keyboards all three new members of the group had worked with steven on various projects over the preceding years and all were excellent musicians sympathetic to the sound and direction of porcupine tree the new line up had immediate chemistry as illustrated by the spiral circus album which contained recordings from their first ever 3 performances including a bbc radio one session for mark radcliffe an early champion of the group the next album would not emerge until early 1995 but was preceded by the classic moonloop ep the last 2 tracks to be recorded during the album sessions and the first to feature the new band released in 1995 the band s third studio album the sky moves sideways became a success among prog fans and porcupine tree were hailed as the pink floyd of the nineties wilson would later lament this stating i can t help that it s true that during the period of the sky moves sideways i had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying in a way the fans of pink floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn t make albums any more moreover i regret it the sky moves sideways was an expansive soundscape of melody and ambient rock experimentation but would prove to be a transitional work with half recorded before the formation of the band and half recorded after most of the album was taken up with the 35 minute title track which at one point steven intended to be long enough to occupy the whole album it also entered the nme melody maker and music week charts together with the moonloop ep this album became the first porcupine tree music to be issued in america in the autumn of 1995 and attracted favourable press on both sides of the atlantic the band supported the album with numerous gigs throughout the year at major venues in the uk the netherlands italy and greece partly unsatisfied with the half band half solo nature of the sky moves sideways porcupine tree promptly got down to the task of recording the first proper band record wilson admitted he was always in love with the idea of the rock band because bands have a kind of glamour and appeal and a romance about them the solo projects just don t have the band worked sporadically over the next year on developing a tighter and more ambitious rock sound after the release of the first real porcupine tree single waiting which entered all uk indie charts and the uk national chart attracting airplay all over europe signify finally saw the light in september 1996 the album was a mixture of instrumental tracks and more song oriented tunes blending together numerous rock and avant garde styles while absorbing many diverse influences but relying on none and still providing a mixture of dreamy melodies and raw power or dark moods the musicians received writing credits for some tracks most notably for intermediate jesus which evolved from a jam session a large amount of major european media interest accompanied the album s release as porcupine tree had now become a highly respected force in the musical underground wilson for me tracks like every home is wired and dark matter totally transcend both genre and comparison finally i think we are making a completely original and 90s form of music but which still has its root in progressive music meanwhile the fanbase of the band kept on growing especially in italy where airplay on a popular radio show had turned the band into a teenagers favourite a remarkable crowd compared to the more prog rock oriented listeners elsewhere in march 1997 they played three nights in rome to an audience that surpassed 5 000 people all three dates were recorded for use in the 1997 live album coma divine recorded live in rome that was released as a goodbye to delerium records which felt it could no longer offer the kind of resources the band needed in order to continue to build its profile worldwide in 1997 wilson was asked by ex marillion singer fish if he would be interested in collaborating on his new album wilson would end up co writing playing on and producing fish s sunsets on empire regarded as the best album the scotsman had released in years interestingly enough two years later marillion would ask wilson to mix part of their new album marillion com working with both camps of one of his favourite teenage bands was a dream come true for wilson in late 1997 the band s first three albums were remastered and reissued signify also saw a release in the us on miles copeland s ark 21 label steven richard colin and chris spent all of 1998 recording their fifth studio album a release that reflected the band s move towards a more song oriented sound wilson acknowledged this time he was much more interested in songwriting as an art form as opposed to soundscape development and commented he took influence from the beach boys pet sounds todd rundgren crosby stills nash young and anything with really good ensemble singing he also indicated that he was interested in the idea of the pop song as a kind of experimental symphony at the time of recording the band had no record deal but later that year they signed to the snapper k scope label and in march 1999 the new album stupid dream was issued the album was supported by a lengthy tour of the uk italy greece the netherlands belgium switzerland germany france poland and the usa the three singles taken from the album piano lessons stranger by the minute and pure narcotic all achieved mainstream exposure in the us and in europe and appeared well placed in the uk independent charts and on radio station playlists in addition snapper released the opener song even less as a one track cassette in a plain white sleeve with the words who is this written in ink a number 1 in the top right hand corner and no catalogue number and delivered it to record stores and radio stations only although initially the album was such a departure that some older fans were unsure it brought the band many new fans and went on to become the band s best selling and most acclaimed release up to that time the time spent looking for a record deal had not been wasted and only a few months after the release of stupid dream the band were ready to begin working on a follow up during the transition into the new millennium completed as for february 2000 with string arrangements provided by dave gregory of xtc porcupine tree s sixth studio album lightbulb sun built on the mix of songwriting soundscaping and rock dynamics of stupid dream the album was released in may 2000 preceded by the single four chords that made a million a sold out show at the scala in london began a short run of uk shows to be followed later in the year by european festival dates and a major tour supporting dream theater the band continued touring through the end of 2000 and start of 2001 including their first major tour of germany a special double cd edition of the lightbulb sun album was issued in israel and germany and in may recordings a limited edition collection of ep tracks and out takes from the previous two albums was released as the band s final release under their snapper k scope contract in may 2001 they did three consecutive dates as a support band to marillion in france germany and the netherlands respectively in june the band played a short us tour starting with an appearance in the famous nearfest of pennsylvania to culminate in a sold out show at the bottom line in new york city shortly afterwards porcupine tree announced that they had signed a new international record deal with lava atlantic records in february 2002 porcupine tree s first line up change occurred when drummer chris maitland departed after eight years with the band the band welcomed drummer and longtime acquaintance gavin harrison to the line up in march 2002 a box set of the band s early work was released entitled stars die the delerium years 1991 1997 and the band commenced recording their first major label album drawing from a pool of 30 new songs written by steven in the previous two years recording sessions took place at avatar studios in new york and london with veteran engineer paul northfield and string arranger dave gregory also playing major roles in the making of the record mixing of the new album was completed in los angeles in may with tim palmer the eagerly awaited new album in absentia was released by lava records in september 2002 the album received great praise worldwide and went on to become the band s best selling album shifting over 100 000 copies in its first year of release and charting in several european countries the band also released a 5 1 surround sound version of the album mixed by grammy award winning producer elliot scheiner the surround sound version of the album won the award for best 5 1 mix at the 2004 surround sound music awards in los angeles to promote the album the band undertook four tours of europe and north america including one with acclaimed swedish metal band opeth on tour the new line up of the band was further augmented by additional touring vocalist guitarist john wesley during these tours the visual element of the band s performance was taken to new heights with the involvement of filmmaker and photographer lasse hoile who created a dark and surreal visual counterpoint to porcupine tree s music the long promotional campaign for in absentia ended on 30 november 2003 as the band played a homecoming show to a sold out london astoria during 2003 porcupine tree also set up their own label transmission with an online store hosted by burning shed record label the first release on the transmission label was a studio session recorded for xm radio washington followed in 2004 by a recording from polish radio in 2001 the band plan to use the label to issue a series of well recorded and packaged live and exclusive studio recordings 2003 also saw the start of a lengthy reissue remaster campaign with many of the early albums expanded to double cds these reissues included re recorded remixed double cd versions of the up the downstair the sky moves sideways and signify albums and the reissue of stupid dream and lightbulb sun both comprising a cd with a new stereo mix of the album plus a dvd a with a 5 1 surround mix in early 2004 the band embarked on the recording sessions for an ambitious new porcupine tree album deadwing their second for lava atlantic the album takes its inspiration from a film script written by steven with his filmmaker friend mike bennion with the album sessions completed in november 2004 and the band s total worldwide sales now approaching half a million units demand for new music from the band was at an all time high and increasing media coverage word of mouth and fan power continued to create interest in porcupine tree throughout the world deadwing was released in europe and the us during the spring of 2005 as both a stereo and 5 1 surround sound album preceded by the release of two singles shallow in the us and lazarus in europe the album counted on the presence of adrian belew from king crimson and opeth s mikael åkerfeldt and was a commercial success due in part to shallow receiving airplay peaking at 26 in the billboard s hot mainstream rock tracks lazarus entered the germany singles top 100 at 91 the tour to promote the album commenced in the uk at the end of march and continued throughout the year the song shallow would later be featured in the soundtrack for the film four brothers later on mike bennion created a myspace page dedicated to the prospective deadwing film in which he posted the first fifteen pages of the script and included a trailer however while the scripts are finished the project is still on hiatus due to lack of budget the album won the surround music awards for best made for surround title the same year of its release and was voted number 2 album of 2005 in sound vision which is the most widely distributed us magazine in the field of home electronics and entertainment the white stripes s get behind me satan was the number one album porcupine tree released deadwing in japan on 22 march 2006 making it the first album by the band to be released in that country the band s website also announced that new material would be played during the first half of their tours of europe and the united states their new material was much heavier and layered than anything they had previously done indicating that porcupine tree was heading towards an even more metal oriented sound on 8 august 2006 it was announced that porcupine tree had signed with roadrunner records uk said wilson roadrunner has established itself as one of the world s premier independent labels for rock music and we couldn t be more enthusiastic about working with them to expand our audience and elevate porcupine tree to the next level the first porcupine tree concert dvd arriving somewhere  was released on 10 october 2006 it was accompanied by a brief tour in which 50 minutes of new material for the forthcoming studio album were performed at the first half of the shows supporting acts included swedish band paatos in europe and projekct 6 in the usa in january 2007 it was revealed the title for the forthcoming album would be fear of a blank planet with the release of fear of a blank planet on 16 april 2007 porcupine tree have become more prominent on the international scene charting in almost all european countries and peaking at 59 on the united states billboard 200 the tour of 92 dates for 2007 has taken the band to countries they had not previously visited like finland and mexico the tour also included appearances in many major music festivals such as the german twin festivals hurricane and southside and the donington download festival later in 2008 when the tour resumed the band performed their first ever shows in australia the lyrics of the album deal with common behaviour tendencies and other issues concerning society in the beginning of the 21st century such as bipolar disorder attention deficit disorder drugs alienation caused by technology and depravation of youth wilson my fear is that the current generation of kids who re being born into this information revolution growing up with the internet cell phones ipods this download culture american idol reality tv prescription drugs playstations all of these things kind of distract people from what s important about life which is to develop a sense of curiosity about what s out there the concept of the album was inspired mainly by bret easton ellis novel lunar park and the title is a nod to public enemy s album fear of a black planet both albums sharing the particularity to reflect the happenings affecting society in the world at the time while racism was the main issue among young people when public enemy s album was released wilson sees in the 21st century what s replaced race relations as the number 1 concern for young people is a kind of terminal boredom a generation x thing it s the blank generation the album features contributions from rush s alex lifeson and king crimson s robert fripp a new ep called nil recurring was released on 17 september 2007 featuring four unreleased tracks from the fear of a blank planet sessions and also includes another contribution from robert fripp the second leg of the current tour started on 3 october 2007 now promoting new music from the ep nil recurring entered the uk top 30 independent label albums at 8 the ep was later reissued in 18 february 2008 through peaceville records on 5 november 2007 fear of a blank planet won the album of the year award for the 2007 classic rock magazine awards in december 2007 it was nominated for a best surround sound album grammy though love by the beatles won the award in january 2008 was voted best album of 2007 by readers of the dutch progressive rock page the lp version of fear of a blank planet includes the nil recurring ep tracks a recording from an 4 october 2007 in store mostly acoustic performance at park avenue cds in orlando was released on 18 february 2008 on cd under the name of we lost the skyline the title is a reference to the lyrics of the sky moves sideways which was the opening song on the live set the album was released on vinyl of 21 march 2008 it was originally intended to be a full band show but lack of space in the store determined that only the two guitarists steven wilson and john wesley played according to porcupine tree s manager andy leff the band planned to release a live album in september 2008 wilson commented that the album will be issued through roadrunner records however the live record is currently put on hold without a known future this was confirmed by gavin harrison on the drummerworld forum s post 2540 of gavin s thread the band played a short european tour in october 2008 in order to shoot their second live dvd the filming took place on 15 and 16 october 2008 in the netherlands at the 013 tilburg venue in this leg of the tour the band played for the first time as headliners in portugal during one of these shows wilson mentioned that porcupine tree has started work on material for their next album with an eye toward a release in 2009 writing for a new studio album has started and the band is set to begin recording in february 2009 this was confirmed by the band posting this message on their official website writing for the next pt studio record is well underway with the band recently spending 2 weeks secluded in the english countryside working on new tracks recording of these pieces and a new 35 minute sw song cycle is due to start in february and tour plans are being put in place from september onwards following release of the new album as a teenager wilson was a fan of the new wave of british heavy metal from this starting point his interest in music progressed on a cyclic path when he discovered seventies music and progressive rock his interest in metal diminished in favour of experimental music he later discovered bands like gojira mastodon neurosis and meshuggah which restored his faith in metal music for a long time i couldn t find where all these creative musicians were going wilson said and i found them they were working in extreme metal shortly thereafter he went to produce three consecutive albums by swedish progressive death metal band opeth and this had a considerable influence in his further songwriting this shift in influence explains why the musical range of porcupine tree can be split into three phases namely from long psychedelic and space rock pieces in early works to shorter pop rock songs in late nineties and darker more metal oriented songs in the beginning of the 21st century there is also some noticeable influence from krautrock and electronic music since wilson sympathizes with bands such as can neu tangerine dream squarepusher aphex twin and artists like klaus schulze and conrad schnitzler between others wilson has also mentioned on multiple occasions that he admires american musician trent reznor the music of porcupine tree is often described as melancholic at moments by many people even though it is not necessarily linked to steven wilson s personality he states music is a way for him to channel all his negative feelings and an exorcism of those elements within finding it easier to write songs about the negative side of the world than it is about the happy side of the world at the nearfest festival in 2001 before performing stop swimming he said the saddest songs are also the most beautiful porcupine tree is notable for being an album oriented band making very conceptual records where many songs are related to each other even so each porcupine tree song has a distinguishable personality wilson explains the important thing with porcupine tree is that all our songs have a unique sound world that they inhabit i don t like the idea of any song sounding like any other song so most of the time it s a case of finding the sound world first whether it be a texture or a drum rhythm that sets you off on a certain musical path or particular musical atmosphere or flavor for their records the band include mellotron hammered dulcimer and guimbri among other instruments unusual for rock bands above all porcupine tree music has maintained very atmospheric heavily helped by the presence of barbieri on the keyboards cinematic wilson is a declared fan of american filmmaker david lynch textural and very experimental often fusing many genres in a single track very layered very produced very arranged and complex arrangements is the way wilson tries to describe the sound of the band apart from their regular edition the albums stupid dream lightbulb sun in absentia deadwing and fear of a blank planet are available in dts mix this mixing technique has become a tradition for the band in the last years porcupine tree are often categorised as a progressive rock band many listeners familiar with the group label them as such steven wilson has been noted in the past to express a certain dislike for the use of the term progressive to refer to them however in a more recent interview with prog archives com he made note that he has since become more relaxed towards the word considering it is becoming a much broader term as time passes he also admitted he finds unpleasant the press comparing porcupine tree with neo prog bands or citing them as the new pink floyd for me that is so insulting commented wilson in an interview with the dutch progressive rock page because it insinuates that you are living in the shadow of some other band i particularly never wanted to be the new anybody i just wanted to be the old porcupine tree or the new porcupine tree

sense of shame of her public image likewise many of the songs she wrote for her subsequent studio album duty involved feelings of loneliness chaos confusion and the burden of her responsibilities she described her feelings after the writing as unnatural and nervous the musical style was darker as well in contrast with loveppears duty was a rock influenced album with only one dance song audience

influenced by the events the single a duet with keiko yamada was released as part of avex s non profit song nation project which raised money for charity she also dropped the planned cover and opted instead to be portrayed as a peace muse explaining i had a completely different idea for the cover at first we d already reserved the space decided the hair and makeup and everything but after the incident as is typical of me i suddenly changed my mind i knew it wasn t the time for gaudiness for elaborate sets and costumes it sounds odd coming from me but i realize what i say and how i look has a great impact the outlook inspired by the september 11 attacks extended beyond i am  in 2002 hamasaki held her first concert outside japan at the mtv asia music awards ceremony in singapore a move

avex she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person along with her dissatisfaction over her last two studio albums this led her to begin work on my story early in contrast with her previous albums my story had no set theme nor did hamasaki attempt to write something good or even something that would give people hope rather she simply wrote freely and honestly as a result the album contained mostly autobiographical lyrics about her emotions and reminiscences of her career she approached the composition of the music with the same freedom per the lyrics because she liked rock music the album had notable rock overtones she was so pleased with the result that she declared my story the first album she felt satisfied with my story and its singles moments inspire

march 11 2006 to yoyogi on june 11 2006 secrets was appropriately the theme of hamasaki s eighth studio album secret the album also explored strong female figures love and sadness songs depicted the artist s struggles and were written to encourage females although secret was originally intended to be a mini album hamasaki began brimming with things to say while producing the album and wrote five more songs the album consisted mostly of rock songs and ballads to complement these hamasaki experimented with new vocal techniques both of the album s singles startin and blue bird continued her streak of number one singles startin became her twenty sixth setting a new record for most number one singles held by a solo female artist the album also topped the oricon weekly charts making

oricon weekly charts making hamasaki the first female artist in thirty six years to hold the top two positions on any oricon album chart at the end of 2007 the pair became japan s fifth and seventh best selling albums of the year respectively in support of a best 2 and secret hamasaki held the four month long tour of secret from march to the end of june it was her first international tour and aside from japan she performed in taipei shanghai and hong kong her foreign fanbase highly anticipated the concerts and tickets for the taipei and hong kong performances sold out in less than three hours unlike its predecessors the writing of hamasaki s ninth studio album guilty was not an emotional experience for her nor did it have a set theme however she said later that the album s tracks appeared to tell a story most of the songs were dark the album had a notable rock tinge it contained some upbeat dance tracks and ballads though the latter also had rock overtones guilty peaked at the number two position on the weekly oricon charts making it hamasaki s first studio album not to reach the top however hamasaki s first digital only single together when and the singles glitter fated and talkin 2 myself reached the top of their respective charts a short film distance love was used as the music video for glitter and fated the film shot in hong kong co starred hong kong actor shawn yue as hamasaki s romantic interest guilty was later released as a digital album in twenty six countries outside japan nineteen of them western nations that along with hamasaki s decision to employ western djs such as armand van helden for her 2008 remix albums ayu mi x 6 gold and ayu mi x 6 silver has been interpreted as her first step into the global market in april 2008 to commemorate her

rule will be used as the international theme song for the upcoming film dragonball evolution time magazine notes that hamasaki lacks such talent as the dance moves of namie amuro the supermodel allure of hitomi and the vocal pyrotechnics of hikaru utada indeed hamasaki s high pitched voice is often considered screechy even by some fans however her music is sometimes considered one of the major forces in shaping japan s current music trends this has been attributed to her constantly changing image as well as her self penned lyrics though critics credit clever marketing strategies hamasaki s lyrics and image have gained a following predominantly among the generation x of asia mainly because of the conflicting or inharmonious beauty of her fashion and lyrics hamasaki s fashions combine oriental and western elements and her songs unlike those of many of her contemporaries all have english titles but contained no english lyrics the popularity of her music extends beyond japan she has a sizable across asia and is one of the few japanese singers whose albums have sold over 10 000 copies in singapore in 2002 however hamasaki s domestic sales began declining due to a sluggish japanese market and increasing piracy in japan as a result she began moving toward the asian market in 2002 performing at the 2002 mtv asia awards in singapore at south korea s asia song festival and at a concert in beijing to celebrate sino japanese relations with her popularity declining she made a foray into the asian market starting with her first tour of asia in 2007 because of the widespread influence of her music hamasaki has often been compared to madonna whom hamasaki cites as one of her influences along with soul musicians babyface and en vogue and rock bands led zeppelin and deep purple she also admires michelle branch kid rock joan osborne seiko matsuda rie miyazawa and keiko yamada these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career and this also influenced the diversity of her music found on many of her records these remixes span different genres of electronic dance music including eurobeat house and trance as well as acoustic genres such as classical and traditional chinese music she has employed western as well as japanese musicians among those she has worked with are above beyond the lamoureux orchestra of france and traditional chinese music ensemble princess china music orchestra hamasaki has released more than a hundred original songs through them she has covered a wide range of musical styles such as dance metal r b progressive rock pop and classical she uses different instruments and techniques including piano orchestra gospel choirs guitars traditional japanese strings music boxes and effects such as yells claps and scratching she frequently employs others to compose as she has explained i m not a professional i lack even basic knowledge about writing music however she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for m that appealed to her wanting to produce works faithful to her visions hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry i am is representative of this stage in hamasaki s career she directed the production of its songs videos and artwork later in her career however she began delegating many tasks including composition to her staff hamasaki is often involved in the artistic direction of her live performances they are often lavish productions that use a variety of props extravagant costumes and choreographed dances she has used large video screens fireworks simulated rain drops trick stage floors and suspended devices she is also involved in the artistic direction of her promotional videos and tries to convey in the videos the meanings or feelings of their respective songs the themes of the videos are varied she has made sad and fragile or emotional videos refreshing videos and humorous videos some of her videos contain short storylines the video of voyage depicts hamasaki as a woman in a mental hospital whose previous incarnation was a woman in feudal japan who was sacrificed to the moon the video of endless sorrow features a young boy living in a society where speaking is forbidden by law additionally the videos of fairyland my name s women and jewel are among the top twenty or so most expensive music videos making hamasaki the only non anglophone to hold such a distinction in the beginning i was searching for myself in my music my music was for me i didn t have the mental room to be conscious of the listener i wrote to save myself i didn t understand what it was to write songs but over time i began to see many things my influence the responsibilities that gave me hamasaki on the new lyrical directions in i am hamasaki s lyrics all her own have resonated among her fans who praise them as being honest and expressing determination because she has trouble voicing her thoughts hamasaki uses her lyrics as an outlet she draws from her own experiences and emotions and tries to put them honestly into words she has stated that honesty is essential to her lyrics saying if i write when i m low it will be a dark song but i don t care i want to be honest with myself at all times because of this she did not use english lyrics until her album rainbow as she had felt that she could best express herself in japanese as with her musical style the themes of her lyrics have varied although loneliness and confusion were frequent in her earlier albums she has branched out to wider themes such as faith and peace themes in her later albums have included love and the struggles of women in addition to drawing inspiration for her lyrics from personal experiences and feelings hamasaki bases lyrics on sources such as historical events the life of joan of arc was the inspiration for free easy while a story told to her by her friend about a saint named mary served as the basis for m the september 11 attacks inspired a song is born hamasaki s influence goes beyond music she is often considered a fashion icon and trend setter a status attributed to her tight control over her image besides her frequent appearances in fashion magazines such as vivi popteen and cawaii hamasaki has often been lauded for her trendy choices in apparels and accessories oricon has repeatedly named her the most fashionable female artist many aspects of japan s fashions including clothing hair nails and accessories have in some way been influenced by her as with her music trends hamasaki started have spread to asian countries as taiwan china and singapore among the trends hamasaki has started are hime kei and chapatsu hamasaki s constantly changing image is apparent not only in her fashion photo shoots and commercial endorsements but also in her record covers an element she considers essential in conveying her message she portrayed herself as a vine clad peace muse or greek goddess as a twenty first century joan of arc and as a funky lolita though hamasaki portrayed herself in earlier releases as a girl next door she has adopted a more sexualized image since the release of loveppears the covers for records including loveppears i am  and rainbow feature hamasaki in states of partial nudity for which she has generated controversy hamasaki also garnered criticism after she modeled bra for lingerie manufacturer wacoal though most of the criticism alleged that hamasaki was only trying to play catch up with

the ondes martenot french for martenot waves also known as the ondium martenot martenot and ondes musicales is an early electronic musical instrument invented in 1928 by maurice martenot and originally very similar in sound to the theremin the sonic capabilities of the instrument were subsequently expanded by the addition of timbral controls and switchable loudspeakers the instrument s eerie wavering notes are produced by varying the frequency of oscillation in thermionic valves the production of the instrument stopped in 1988 but a few conservatories in france still teach it since 1997 the ondéa project has been trying to create a reimagining of the ondes martenot since the martenot name is still protected the new instrument is called ondéa but has the playing and operational characteristics of the original ondes martenot in 2001 a completed prototype was used in concerts and since 2005 these instruments have been in regular use the ondes martenot has been used by many composers most notably olivier messiaen he first used it in the fête des belles eaux for six ondes written for the 1937 international world s fair in paris and then used it in several of his works including the turangalîla symphonie and trois petites liturgies de la présence divine his opera saint françois d assise requires three of the instruments the composer s widow yvonne loriod messiaen arranged and edited four unpublished feuillet inedits for ondes martenot and piano which were published in 2001 other composers included charles koechlin edgard varèse arthur honegger darius milhaud maurice jarre antoine tisné sylvano bussotti giacinto scelsi marcel landowski pierre boulez tristan murail henri tomasi and frank zappa andré jolivet wrote a concerto for it in 1947 bohuslav martinů authorized the adaptation of his fantasie to the use of the ondes martenot when it proved difficult to perform on the theremin for which it was originally written estimates of the number of works written for ondes martenot vary hugh davies reckoned there to be around a thousand works composed for the instrument jeanne loriod s figures are the more widely quoted she estimated that there were 300 pieces of chamber music including 14 concertos jacques tchamkerten s provisional catalogue of works for ondes included in the current reprinting of loriod s technique lists far fewer works than either of these figures its first use in the cinema was by honegger for berthold bartosch s film the idea it was extensively used by composer brian easdale in the ballet music for the red shoes it was frequently used in horror and science fiction movies and television notably in the 1950s british composer barry gray frequently used it in his scores for gerry anderson s television series and film composer elmer bernstein incorporated the instrument into many of his works beginning with heavy metal in 1981 it was used to haunting effect by the composer david fanshawe in the british television series flambards the only anime composer who has used the instrument is takashi harada in the soundtracks of a tree of palme and later in binchō tan other film scores using the ondes martenot include lawrence of arabia billion dollar brain doppelgänger jesus of nazareth heavy metal ghostbusters a passage to india the black cauldron tucker the man and his dream rising sun amélie by yann tiersen both bodysong and there will be blood by jonny greenwood of radiohead la marche de l empereur by emilie simon played by thomas bloch the score of a tree of palme also notably features the ondes martenot it is not however responsible for the female voice effects in the original star trek theme despite many rumors to the contrary one of the first integrations of the ondes martenot into popular music was achieved in the quebec musical scene the two most popular québécois musical groups of the time beau dommage and harmonium made extensive use of this instrument in each of their 1975 albums respectively où est passée la noce and si on avait besoin d une cinquième saison harmonium later toured with supertramp and received several reviews of their work by english speaking musical critics of progressive rock who noted their use of the ondes martenot jonny greenwood is often credited with bringing the ondes to a larger audience through radiohead s kid a amnesiac hail to the thief and in rainbows albums greenwood uses the ondes martenot often in his solo efforts and has written a piece for the instrument entitled smear in live concerts radiohead have used six ondes for how to disappear completely the ondes martenot was also utilized by bryan ferry in 1999 on the album as time goes by and by joe jackson on his 1988 soundtrack album for tucker the man and his dream and his 1994 album night music recently ondist thomas bloch has toured in tom waits and robert wilson s show the black rider with marianne faithfull and in gorillaz leader damon albarn s show monkey journey to the west also yann tiersen well known for writing the music to amelie often features the use of the ondes martenot in his music his dvd la traversee documenting the recording of les retrouvailles shows his use of the instrument the ondes martenot is unique among electronic musical instruments in its methods of control maurice martenot was a cellist and it was his vision to bring the degree of musical expressivity associated with the cello to his new instrument the ondes in its later forms can be controlled either by depressing keys on the six octave keyboard or by sliding a metal ring worn on the right hand index finger in front of the keyboard the position of the ring corresponds in pitch to the horizontal location along the keyboard the latter playing method allows for unbroken sweeping glissandi to be produced in much the same manner as a theremin the keyboard itself has a lateral range of movement of several millimeters permitting vibrati of nearly a semitone below or above the pitch of the depressed key to be produced by depressing keys or moving the ring no sound is initially produced a control operated by the left hand and situated in a small drawer of controls on the left side of the instrument controls the musical dynamics from silence to fortissimo this control is glass and lozenge shaped and can be depressed several centimetres the depth to which this key is depressed determines the dynamic level the deeper the louder the manner in which it is pressed determines the attack of the note quick taps produce staccato articulations whilst more controlled and deliberate depressions are used to play legato the small drawer of controls also contains flip switches to control the instrument s timbre these function in much the same way as a pipe organ s stops can be added or removed like organ stops each switch has its own sound color which can be added to the chorus of other timbres the 1975 model instrument features the following timbres in addition to the timbral controls the control drawer also contains flip switches which determine to which loudspeakers the instrument s output are routed these are labeled d1 to d4 
rockbox is a free software replacement for the firmware held on various forms of digital audio players rockbox offers an alternative to the host device s operating system firmware which provides a plug in architecture for adding various enhancements and functionality to daps which are not present in the original os enhancements include pda functionality applications utilities and games rockbox can also retrofit video playback functionality onto daps first released in mid 2000 rockbox also includes a voice driven user interface suitable for operation by blind and visually impaired users rockbox runs on a wide variety of portable audio devices with very different hardware abilities from early archos players with 1 bit character cell based displays to modern players with high resolution color displays digital optical audio hardware and advanced recording capabilities released under the gnu general public license rockbox is free software the rockbox project began in late 2001 and was first implemented on the early archos series of hard disk based mp3 players and player recorders including the flash only model ondio because of owner frustration with severe limitations in the manufacturer supplied user interface and device operations these devices have relatively weak main cpus and instead offload music playback to dedicated hardware mp3 decoding chips rockbox therefore was unable to significantly alter playback capabilities instead it offered a greatly improved user interface and added plugin functionality not present in the factory firmware rockbox is capable of being permanently flashed into flash memory on the archos devices making it a literal firmware replacement versions of rockbox have since been produced for more sophisticated devices these perform audio decoding in software allowing rockbox to potentially support many more music formats than the original firmware as well as bringing the extensibility and increased functionality already present in the archos ports rockbox is run from the hard disk on these devices after being started with a custom bootloader so to upgrade rockbox users need only copy the files onto the player s drive and restart the device reflashing is only necessary when changing the bootloader and on some platforms is not required at all the first of these ports beginning in late 2004 was for the coldfire powered devices manufactured by iriver focusing on the h1xx series of hard drive players approximately one year later a port for the h3xx series became functional offering similar functionality in late 2005 work began on a port of rockbox to apple ipod portable players throughout 2006 rockbox ports were made available for a variety of ipod models as well as the cowon iaudio x5 series as of february 2007 usable ports are also available for the iriver h10 and toshiba gigabeat f x series as of march 5th 2007 a new port for the cowon iaudio m5 became functional on march 11th 2007 the sandisk sansa e200 series became the next addition to the rockbox lineup on may 23rd 2007 support for the ipod video 80 gb model was added completing the ipod video lineup on july 27 2007 initial support was added for the ipod 1g and 2g on september 23 2007 the sansa c200 series was welcomed into the lineup on march 18th 2008 the olympus m robe 100 became the first new port of 2008 and the iaudio m3 joined the lineup days later rockbox now includes video support for mpeg playback through the included work in progress mpegplayer plugin to date all rockbox ports have been accomplished by reverse engineering with little or no manufacturer assistance however as free software many rockbox developers and supporters hope to eventually see official manufacturer support for new ports or at least unofficial assistance in porting rockbox to new devices to date only a few companies have expressed interest in rockbox and none have officially contributed code to the project or included it with their hardware the sansa port is the first to be started at the request of the hardware manufacturer who gave the rockbox team samples of their devices rockbox is continuously developed with new svn builds being released after every source change subject to the limitations of each particular platform the appearance of rockbox can be customised in various ways fonts and foreground and background colours can be added and selected while a simple markup language can be used to create themes for the menu and while playing screens these themes can include background and other images plus various formats for filenames id3 tags file progress time and system information album art has become official as of november 11 2007 rockbox has been essentially a file tree based player to which folders could be dragged and dropped then navigated by folder structure more recent versions however have included a database feature which allows the player to compile information from the files id3 tags the user can then navigate the files using this database regardless of file structure rockbox on software decoding platforms supports playback of eight lossy codecs five lossless two uncompressed and six miscellaneous formats this makes a conservative total of 21 supported audio formats although a few of them do not operate in realtime on all platforms mpeg audio layers i iii ogg vorbis mpeg 4 aac musepack ac3 wma speex and the lossy portion of wavpack hybrid files are supported lossy formats lossless formats include flac wavpack shorten apple lossless and monkey s audio rockbox plays intel style wav and apple aiff uncompressed audio in addition there are playback of game audio types adx sid nsf sap and spc the mod tracker format is also now supported note that monkey s audio support is in the early stages with only the lowest compression settings playing in realtime on most devices also note that any file with drm scheme will not play in rockbox beside the ability of playing and recording audio files rockbox offers many playback enhancements that other firmwares may not have implemented yet listed below are a handful of these features rockbox developers can create plug ins which provide the user with other enhancements that may not be available on various firmware modules available plug ins include rockbox development is always ongoing however either due to the lack of support from external companies or platform drawbacks rockbox has a few features which are not yet implemented rockbox uses a simple kernel with a flat memory model and single process thin threads run cooperatively returning control to a scheduler that prioritizes the audio thread the only form of preemption is through interrupts the operating system and plugins are written in c with assembler used for device and platform specific code in addition to performance sensitive code the simple and lightweight architecture allows rockbox to run on a variety of targets with memory ranging from 1 to 64 mb and cpu speeds ranging 12 to 532 mhz rockbox also provides limited support for multicore and asymmetric multiprocessor systems the latest release is version 3 2 the following should be considered to be a list of devices that at least substantially work see the rockbox device chart for details high density microsdhc memory cards can be read by rockbox in the e200 series the

nirvana was an american rock band that was formed by singer guitarist kurt cobain and bassist krist novoselic in aberdeen washington in 1987 nirvana went through a succession of drummers the most notable being dave grohl who joined the band in 1990 with the lead single smells like teen spirit from the band s second album nevermind nirvana entered into the mainstream bringing along with it a subgenre of alternative rock called grunge other seattle grunge bands such as alice in chains pearl jam and soundgarden also gained popularity and as a result alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the united states during the early to mid 1990s as nirvana s frontman kurt cobain found himself referred to in the media as the spokesman of a generation with nirvana the flagship band of generation x cobain was uncomfortable with the attention and placed his focus on the band s music believing the band s message and artistic vision to have been misinterpreted by the public challenging the band s audience with its third studio album in utero nirvana s brief run ended with cobain s death in april 1994 but the band s popularity continued in the years that followed in 2002 you know you re right an unfinished demo from the band s final recording session topped radio playlists around the world since their debut the band has sold over twenty five million albums in the us alone and over fifty million worldwide cobain and novoselic met in 1985 both were fans of the melvins and frequented the band s practice space after a couple of false starts at forming their own band the duo recruited drummer aaron burckhard creating the first incarnation of what would eventually become nirvana cobain later described the sound of the band when they first started as a gang of four and scratch acid ripoff within a few months burckhard was fired from the band he was temporarily replaced by dale crover of the melvins who played on the band s first demos dave foster then began a brief tenure as the band s drummer during its initial months the band went through a series of names including skid row pen cap chew and ted ed fred the band finally settled on nirvana in early 1988 which cobain said was chosen because i wanted a name that was kind of beautiful or nice and pretty instead of a mean raunchy punk rock name like the angry samoans nirvana played their first show under the name that march a couple of months later the band finally settled on a drummer chad channing nirvana s first release was the single love buzz big cheese in 1988 on seattle independent record label sub pop the following year the band released its first album bleach to record bleach the band turned to noted local producer jack endino who had recorded the band s first studio demos bleach was highly influenced by the melvins by the heavy dirge rock of mudhoney 1980s punk rock the pixies and by the 1970s heavy metal of black sabbath novoselic noted in a 2001 interview with rolling stone that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by the smithereens on one side and an album by the black metal band celtic frost on the other and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well bleach became a favorite of college radio stations nationally but gave few hints of where the band would find itself two years later the money for the recording sessions for bleach listed as 606 17 on the album sleeve was supplied by jason everman everman was introduced to cobain by dylan carlson but had known channing since the fifth grade everman began hanging out with the band and offered to lend the money to them for the recording though everman did not actually play on the album he was credited for playing guitar on bleach because according to novoselic they wanted to make him feel more at home in the band after the album was completed everman had a brief and contentious stay with the band as a second guitar player but was fired following their first us tour in a late 1989 interview cobain noted that the band s music was changing he said the early songs were really angry  but as time goes on the songs are getting poppier and poppier as i get happier and happier the songs are now about conflicts in relationships emotional things with other human beings in april 1990 the band began working with producer butch vig at smart studios in madison wisconsin on recordings for the follow up to bleach during the sessions kurt and krist became disenchanted with channing s drumming and channing expressed frustration at not being actively involved in songwriting not long after the sessions were complete channing was gone from the band after a few weeks with dale crover of the melvins filling in nirvana hired mudhoney drummer dan peters with whom they recorded the song sliver a few weeks later buzz osborne of the melvins introduced them to dave grohl who was looking for a new band following the sudden break up of d c hardcore punks scream a few days after arriving in seattle novoselic and cobain auditioned grohl with novoselic later stating we knew in two minutes that he was the right drummer disenchanted with sub pop and with the smart studios sessions generating interest nirvana decided to look for a deal with a major record label following repeated recommendations by sonic youth s kim gordon nirvana signed to dgc records in 1990 the band subsequently began recording its first major label album nevermind they were offered a number of producers to choose from but ultimately held out for butch vig rather than recording at vig s madison studio as they had in 1990 they shifted to sound city studios in van nuys los angeles california for two months the band worked through a variety of songs in their catalog some of the songs including in bloom and breed had been in the band s repertoire for years while others including on a plain and stay away lacked finished lyrics until mid way through the recording process after the recording sessions were completed vig and the band set out to mix the album however the recording sessions had run behind schedule and the resulting mixes were deemed unsatisfactory slayer mixer andy wallace was brought in to create the final mix after the album s release members of nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given nevermind initially dgc records was hoping to sell 250 000 copies of nevermind which was the same level they had achieved with sonic youth s goo however the album s first single smells like teen spirit quickly gained momentum thanks in part to significant airplay of the song s music video on mtv as they toured europe during late 1991 the band found that the shows were dangerously oversold that television crews were becoming a constant presence onstage and that smells like teen spirit was almost omnipresent on radio and music television by christmas 1991 nevermind was selling 400 000 copies a week in the us on january 11 1992 the album reached number one on the billboard album charts replacing michael jackson s album dangerous the album also topped the charts in numerous countries worldwide the month nevermind reached number one billboard proclaimed nirvana is that rare band that has everything critical acclaim industry respect pop radio appeal and a rock solid college alternative base in february 1992 following the band s pacific rim tour cobain married hole frontwoman courtney love in hawaii love gave birth to a daughter frances bean cobain the following august citing exhaustion the band decided not to undertake another u s tour in support of nevermind instead opting to make only a handful of performances later that year just days after frances bean s birth nirvana performed one of its best known concerts headlining at the reading festival in england amid rumors about cobain s health and the possibility the band might break up cobain entered the stage in a wheelchair as a practical joke then proceeded to get up and join the rest of the band in tearing through an assortment of old and new material dave grohl related in 2005 on the radio program loveline that the band was genuinely concerned beforehand that the show would be a complete disaster given all that had happened in the months leading up to the show instead the performance ended up being one of the most memorable of their career less than two weeks later nirvana performed at the mtv video music awards during the first rehearsal for the show cobain announced that they were going to play a new song during the broadcast and the band rehearsed rape me mtv s executives were appalled by the song and according to show producer amy finnerty the executives believed that the song was about them they insisted that the band could not play rape me even threatening to throw nirvana off the show and stop airing their videos entirely after a series of intense discussions mtv and nirvana agreed that the band would play lithium their latest single when the band began their performance cobain strummed and sang the first few bars of rape me one last jab at mtv s executives before breaking into lithium near the end of the song frustrated that his amp had stopped functioning novoselic decided to toss his bass into the air for dramatic effect he misjudged the landing and the bass ended up bouncing off his forehead causing him to stumble off the stage in a daze as cobain trashed their equipment grohl ran to the mic and began yelling hi axl repeatedly referring to guns n roses singer axl rose with whom the band and courtney had had a bizarre encounter before the show nirvana released incesticide a collection of rarities and b sides in december 1992 many of nirvana s radio sessions and unreleased early recordings were starting to circulate via trading circles and illegal bootlegs so the album served to circumvent the bootleggers the album contained songs from previously released singles and eps including sliver and dive as well as material from the band s sessions for the bbc including been a son aneurysm and covers of songs by the vaselines and devo for 1993 s in utero the band brought in producer steve albini well known for his work on the pixies album surfer rosa as nevermind had brought in a new audience of listeners who had little or no experience with the alternative obscure or experimental bands nirvana saw as their forebears bringing in albini appeared to be a deliberate move on nirvana s part to give the album a raw less polished sound for example one song on in utero featuring long periods of shrill feedback noise was titled ironically radio friendly unit shifter however cobain insisted that albini s sound was simply the one he had always wanted nirvana to have a natural recording without layers of studio trickery the sessions with albini were productive and notably quick and the album was recorded and mixed in two weeks for a cost of 25 000 at pachyderm studios in cannon falls minnesota several weeks after the completion of the recording sessions stories ran in the chicago tribune and newsweek that quoted sources claiming dgc considered the album unreleasable as a result fans began to believe that the band s creative vision might be compromised by their label while the stories about dgc shelving the album were untrue the band actually was unhappy with certain aspects of albini s mixes specifically they thought the bass levels were too low and cobain felt that heart shaped box and all apologies did not sound perfect longtime r e m producer scott litt was called in to help remix those two songs with cobain adding additional instrumentation and backing vocals in utero debuted at number one on the billboard 200 album chart in september 1993 time s christopher john farley wrote in his review of the album despite the fears of some alternative music fans nirvana hasn t gone mainstream though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go nirvana although commercially successful the album did not achieve the same success as nevermind that fall nirvana embarked on its first major tour of the united states in two years for the tour the band added pat smear of the punk rock band germs as a second guitarist in november 1993 nirvana performed for mtv unplugged the band opted to stay away from their most recognizable songs playing only two of their hits all apologies and come as you are grohl later related we knew we didn t want to do an acoustic version of teen spirit that would ve been horrendously stupid the setlist also included a few relatively obscure covers with members of the meat puppets joining the band for covers of three of their songs while rehearsals for the show had been problematic mtv unplugged producer alex coletti noted that the actual taping went exceedingly well with every song performed in one take and with the complete set lasting under an hour which were both unusual for unplugged sessions following the band s set ending performance of lead belly s where did you sleep last night coletti tried to convince the band to perform an encore kurt said i can t top that last song and when he said that i backed off cause i knew he was right the band s performance debuted on mtv on december 14 1993 in early 1994 the band embarked on a european tour following a tour stop at terminal eins in munich germany on march 1 cobain was diagnosed with bronchitis and severe laryngitis the next night s show at the same venue was canceled in rome on the morning of march 4 love found cobain unconscious in their hotel room and he was rushed to the hospital a doctor from the hospital told a press conference that cobain had reacted to a combination of prescription rohypnol and alcohol the rest of the tour was canceled including a planned leg in the uk in the ensuing weeks cobain s heroin addiction resurfaced an intervention was organized and cobain was convinced to admit himself into drug rehabilitation after less than a week in rehabilitation cobain climbed over the wall of the facility and took a plane back to seattle a week later on friday april 8 1994 cobain was found dead of an apparently self inflicted shotgun wound to the head at his seattle home effectively dissolving nirvana in the years following nirvana s disbanding both surviving members remained musically active not long after cobain s death grohl recorded a series of demos that eventually became the debut album for foo fighters foo fighters became grohl s main project releasing several commercially successful records over the next decade beyond foo fighters grohl also drummed for numerous bands including tom petty and the heartbreakers mike watt queens of the stone age tenacious d nine inch nails and killing joke he also recorded an album of metal songs featuring many of his favorite early 80s metal singers under the name probot after the end of nirvana novoselic formed sweet 75 later he founded eyes adrift with curt kirkwood and bud gaugh he also performed in a one off band called the no wto combo with kim thayil of soundgarden and jello biafra of the dead kennedys that coincided with the wto meeting of 1999 in december 2006 novoselic replaced bass player bruno desmartas in the band flipper for a uk ireland tour and several us shows novoselic also became a political activist founding the political action committee jampac to support musicians rights in 2004 he released a book titled of grunge and government let s fix this broken democracy which covered his musical past as well as his political endeavors several nirvana albums have been released since cobain s death the first came in november 1994 with the release of the band s performance for mtv unplugged mtv unplugged in new york two weeks after the release of unplugged in new york a video compilation of nirvana performances titled live tonight sold out was released cobain himself had compiled a significant part of the video which documented much of the nevermind tour the original intention was to release the mtv unplugged set in a double disc package along with a second disc of live electric material to balance the acoustic set however for the two surviving band members sorting through nirvana recordings so soon after cobain s passing became too emotionally overwhelming the live disc a compilation of nirvana concert recordings finally saw release in october 1996 titled from the muddy banks of the wishkah in august 1997 online music news website wall of sound reported that grohl and novoselic were organizing a box set of nirvana rarities four years later the band s label announced that the box set was complete and would see release in september to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of nevermind however shortly before the release date love filed an injunction to stop the box set s release and sued grohl and novoselic claiming that cobain s former band mates were hijacking nirvana s legacy for their own personal interests what followed was a protracted legal battle over the ownership of nirvana s music that lasted for more than a year much of the legal wrangling centered on a single unreleased song you know you re right the band s final studio recording grohl and novoselic wanted to include the song on the box set essentially releasing all of the rarities at one time love however argued that the song was more important than just a generic rarity and should be included on a single disc greatest hits compilation after more than a year of often public and sometimes bizarre legal maneuvering the parties settled agreeing on the immediate release of the greatest hits package including you know you re right titled simply nirvana in turn love agreed to donate cassette demos recorded by cobain for use on the box set the compilation album nirvana was released on october 29 2002 on top of you know you re right the album contained hit singles from their three studio albums as well as several alternate mixes and recordings of familiar nirvana songs the box set with the lights out was finally released in november 2004 the release contained a vast array of early cobain demos rough rehearsal recordings and live tracks recorded throughout the band s history a best of the box compilation titled sliver the best of the box was released in late 2005 the cd compiled nineteen tracks from the box set plus three previously unreleased tracks including a version of the song spank thru from the 1985 fecal matter demo tape in a 2002 interview with jim derogatis love described the countless rehearsal tapes demos and bedroom recordings that were left behind after cobain s death in april 2006 love announced that she had arranged to sell twenty five percent of her stake in the nirvana song catalog in a deal estimated at 50 million the share of nirvana s publishing was purchased by primary wave music which was founded by larry mestel a former ceo of virgin records in an accompanying statement love sought to assure nirvana s fanbase that the music would not simply be licensed to the highest bidder noting we are going to remain very tasteful and true to the spirit of nirvana while taking the music to places it has never been before further releases have since been made this includes releasing live tonight sold out on dvd in 2006 furthermore a full uncut dvd version of mtv unplugged in new york was released in 2007 
electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production in general a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium hammond organ and the electric guitar purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin sound synthesizer and computer electronic music was once associated almost exclusively with western art music but from the late 1960s on the availability of affordable music technology meant that music produced using electronic means became increasingly common in the popular domain today electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from experimental art music to popular forms such as electronic dance music the ability to record sounds is often connected to the production of electronic music but not absolutely necessary for it the earliest known sound recording device was the phonautograph patented in 1857 by édouard léon scott de martinville it could record sounds visually but was not meant to play them back in 1878 thomas a edison patented the phonograph which used cylinders similar to scott s device although cylinders continued in use for some time emile berliner developed the disc phonograph in 1887 a significant invention which was later to have a profound effect on electronic music was lee deforest s triode audion this was the first thermionic valve or vacuum tube invented in 1906 which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals radio broadcasting and electronic computation amongst other things before electronic music there was a growing desire for composers to use emerging technologies for musical purposes several instruments were created that employed electromechanical designs and they paved the way for the later emergence of electronic instruments an electromechanical instrument called the telharmonium was developed by thaddeus cahill in the years 1898 1912 however simple inconvenience hindered the adoption of the telharmonium due to its immense size the first electronic instrument is often viewed to be the theremin invented by professor leon theremin circa 1919 1920 another early electronic instrument was the ondes martenot which was most famously used in the turangalîla symphonie by olivier messiaen as well as other works by him it was also used by other primarily french composers such as andre jolivet just a year later another significant contribution was made to the advent of experimental music this was the 1907 publication of ferruccio busoni s sketch of a new esthetic of music which discussed the use of electrical and other new sound sources in future music he wrote of the future of microtonal scales in music made possible by cahill s dynamophone only a long and careful series of experiments and a continued training of the ear can render this unfamiliar material approachable and plastic for the coming generation and for art also in the sketch of a new esthetic of music busoni states music as an art our so called occidental music is hardly four hundred years old its state is one of development perhaps the very first stage of a development beyond present conception and we we talk of classics and hallowed traditions and we have talked of them for a long time we have formulated rules stated principles laid down laws we apply laws made for maturity to a child that knows nothing of responsibility young as it is this child we already recognize that it possesses one radiant attribute which signalizes it beyond all its elder sisters and the lawgivers will not see this marvelous attribute lest their laws should be thrown to the winds this child it floats on air it touches not the earth with its feet it knows no law of gravitation it is wellnigh incorporeal its material is transparent it is sonorous air it is almost nature herself it is free but freedom is something that mankind have never wholly comprehended never realized to the full they can neither recognize or acknowledge it they disavow the mission of this child they hang weights upon it this buoyant creature must walk decently like anybody else it may scarcely be allowed to leap when it were its joy to follow the line of the rainbow and to break sunbeams with the clouds through this writing as well as personal contact busoni had a profound effect on many musicians and composers perhaps most notably on his pupil edgard varèse who said together we used to discuss what direction the music of the future would or rather should take and could not take as long as the straitjacket of the tempered system he deplored that his own keyboard instrument had conditioned our ears to accept only an infinitesimal part of the infinite gradations of sounds in nature he was very much interested in the electrical instruments we began to hear about and i remember particularly one he had read of called the dynamophone all through his writings one finds over and over again predictions about the music of the future which have since come true in fact there is hardly a development that he did not foresee as for instance in this extraordinary prophecy i almost think that in the new great music machines will also be necessary and will be assigned a share in it perhaps industry too will bring forth her share in the artistic ascent in italy the futurists were coming at the changing aesthetic from a different angle but one that also affected the world of classical music a major thrust of the futurist philosophy was to value noise and to place artistic and expressive value on sounds that had previously not been considered even remotely musical balilla pratella s technical manifesto of futurist music states that their credo is to present the musical soul of the masses of the great factories of the railways of the transatlantic liners of the battleships of the automobiles and airplanes to add to the great central themes of the musical poem the domain of the machine and the victorious kingdom of electricity on 11 march 1913 futurist luigi russolo published his manifesto the art of noises in 1914 he held the first art of noises concert in milan on april 21 this used his intonarumori described by russolo as acoustical noise instruments whose sounds were hand activated and projected by horns and megaphones in june similar concerts were held in paris this decade brought a wealth of early electronic instruments along with the theremin there is the presentation of the ondes martenot which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in hindu music and the trautonium maurice martenot invented the ondes martenot in 1928 and soon demonstrated it in paris another development which aroused the interest of many composers occurred in 1919 1920 in leningrad leon theremin built and demonstrated his etherophone which was later renamed the theremin this led to the first compositions for electronic instruments as opposed to noisemakers and re purposed machines in 1929 joseph schillinger composed first airphonic suite for theremin and orchestra premièred with the cleveland orchestra with leon theremin as soloist in 1924 ottorino respighi composed the pines of rome which calls for the use of a phonograph recording of nightingales however at the time of composition phonograph players were acoustical not electric and this is actually more along the lines of using a sound effect and therefore cannot be considered an electroacoustic element in the composition the following year antheil first composed for mechanical devices electrical noisemakers motors and amplifiers in his unfinished opera mr bloom as a response to the art of noises of luigi russolo marinetti and the other futurists and just one year later in 1926 was the première of antheil s ballet mécanique using car horns airplane propellers saws and anvils recording of sounds made a leap in 1927 when american inventor j a o neill developed a recording device that used magnetically coated ribbon however this was a commercial failure two years later laurens hammond established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments he went on to produce the hammond organ which was based on the principles of the telharmonium along with other developments including early reverberation units the method of photo optic sound recording used in cinematography made it possible to obtain a visible image of a sound wave as well as to realize the opposite goal synthesizing a sound from an artificially drawn sound wave the research work by the russian optical engineer evgeny murzin taken from 1937 to 1957 made it possible to create a photoelectric synthesizer a musical instrument that combined three processes creation recording and playback of music murzin named his invention in honour of the composer alexander nikolayevich scriabin low fidelity magnetic wire recorders had been in use since 1898 and in the late 1920s the movie industry adopted optical sound on film recording systems based on the photoelectric cell but it was not until the 1930s that the german electronics company aeg developed the first practical audio tape recorder the magnetophon during world war ii aeg technicians discovered the ac biasing technique which dramatically improved the fidlelity of magnetic recording by adding an inaudible high frequency tone and by 1943 aeg had developed the first stereo tape recorders however these devices and techniques remained a secret outside germany until the end of wwii when captured magnetophon recorders and reels of farben recording tape were brought back to the united states by jack mullin and others these captured recorders and tapes were the basis for the development of the first commercial tape recorder the model 200 manufactured by the american ampex company with support from entertainer bing crosby who became the first performer to record radio broadcasts and studio master recordings on tape magnetic audio tape opened up a vast new range of sonic possibilities to musicians composers producers and engineers audio tape was relatively cheap and very reliable and its fidelity of reproduction was better than any audio medium to date most importantly unlike discs it offered the same plasticity of use as film tape can be slowed down speeded up or run even backwards during recording or playback with often startling effect it can be physically edited in much the same way as film allowing for unwanted sections of a recording to be seamlessly removed or replaced likewise segments of tape from other sources can be edited in tape can also be joined to form endless loops that continually play repeated patterns of pre recorded material audio amplification and mixing equipment further expanded tape s capabilities as a production medium allowing multiple pre taped recordings to be mixed together and simultaneously recorded onto another tape with relatively little loss of fidelity another unforseen windfall was that tape recorders can be relatively easily modified to become echo machines that produce complex controllable high quality echo and reverberation effects it wasn t long before composers began using the tape recorder to develop a new technique for composition called musique concrète this technique involved editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds the first pieces of musique concrète were assembled by pierre schaeffer who went on to collaborate with pierre henry on 5 october 1948 radiodiffusion française broadcast composer pierre schaeffer s etude aux chemins de fer this was the first movement of cinq études de bruits and marked the beginning of studio realizations and musique concrète schaeffer employed a disk cutting lathe four turntables a four channel mixer filters an echo chamber and a mobile recording unit not long after this henry began collaborating with schaeffer a partnership that would have profound and lasting affects on the direction of electronic music another associate of schaeffer edgard varèse began work on déserts a work for chamber orchestra and tape the tape parts were created at pierre schaeffer s studio and were later revised at columbia university in 1950 schaeffer gave the first public concert of musique concrète at the ecole normale de musique de paris schaeffer used a pa system several turntables and mixers the performance did not go well as creating live montages with turntables had never been done before later that same year pierre henry collaborated with schaeffer on symphonie pour un homme seul the first major work of musique concrete in paris in 1951 in what was to become an important worldwide trend rtf established the first studio for the production of electronic music also in 1951 schaeffer and henry produced an opera orpheus for concrete sounds and voices karlheinz stockhausen worked briefly in schaeffer s studio in 1952 and afterward for many years at the wdr cologne s studio for electronic music in cologne what would become the most famous electronic music studio in the world was officially opened at the radio studios of the nwdr in 1953 though it had been in the planning stages as early as 1950 and early compositions were made and broadcast in 1951 the brain child of werner meyer eppler robert beyer and herbert eimert the studio was soon joined by karlheinz stockhausen and gottfried michael koenig in his 1949 thesis elektronische klangerzeugung elektronische musik und synthetische sprache meyer eppler conceived the idea to synthesize music entirely from electronically produced signals in this way elektronische musik was sharply differentiated from french musique concrète which used sounds recorded from acoustical sources with stockhausen and mauricio kagel in residence it became a year round hive of charismatic avante gardism on two occasions combining electronically generated sounds with relatively conventional orchestras in mixtur and hymnen dritte region mit orchester stockhausen stated that his listeners had told him his electronic music gave them an experience of outer space sensations of flying or being in a fantastic dream world more recently stockhausen turned to producing electronic music in his own studio in kürten his last work in the genre being cosmic pulses in the united states sounds were being created electronically and used in composition as exemplified in a piece by morton feldman called marginal intersection this piece is scored for winds brass percussion strings 2 oscillators and sound effects of riveting and the score uses feldman s graph notation the music for magnetic tape project was formed by members of the new york school and lasted three years until 1954 cage wrote of this collaboration in this social darkness therefore the work of earle brown morton feldman and christian wolff continues to present a brilliant light for the reason that at the several points of notation performance and audition action is provocative cage completed williams mix in 1953 while working with the music for magnetic tape project the group had no permanent facility and had to rely on borrowed time in commercial sound studios including the studio of louis and bebe barron also in the u s in the same year significant developments were happening in new york city columbia university purchased its first tape recorder a professional ampex machine for the purpose of recording concerts vladimir ussachevsky who was on the music faculty of columbia university was placed in charge of the device and almost immediately began experimenting with it herbert russcol writes soon he was intrigued with the new sonorities he could achieve by recording musical instruments and then superimposing them on one another ussachevsky said later i suddenly realized that the tape recorder could be treated as an instrument of sound transformation on thursday may 8 1952 ussachevsky presented several demonstrations of tape music effects that he created at his composers forum in the mcmillin theatre at columbia university these included transposition reverberation experiment composition and underwater valse in an interview he stated i presented a few examples of my discovery in a public concert in new york together with other compositions i had written for conventional instruments otto luening who had attended this concert remarked the equipment at his disposal consisted of an ampex tape recorder  and a simple box like device designed by the brilliant young engineer peter mauzey to create feedback a form of mechanical reverberation other equipment was borrowed or purchased with personal funds just three months later in august 1952 ussachevsky traveled to bennington vermont at luening s invitation to present his experiments there the two collaborated on various pieces luening described the event equipped with earphones and a flute i began developing my first tape recorder composition both of us were fluent improvisors and the medium fired our imaginations they played some early pieces informally at a party where a number of composers almost solemnly congratulated us saying this is it word quickly reached new york city oliver daniel telephoned and invited the pair to produce a group of short compositions for the october concert sponsored by the american composers alliance and broadcast music inc under the direction of leopold stokowski at the museum of modern art in new york after some hesitation we agreed  henry cowell placed his home and studio in woodstock new york at our disposal with the borrowed equipment in the back of ussachevsky s car we left bennington for woodstock and stayed two weeks  in late september 1952 the travelling laboratory reached ussachevsky s living room in new york where we eventually completed the compositions two months later on october 28 vladimir ussachevsky and otto luening presented the first tape music concert in the united states the concert included luening s fantasy in space an impressionistic virtuoso piece using manipulated recordings of flute and low speed an exotic composition that took the flute far below its natural range both pieces were created at the home of henry cowell in woodstock ny after several concerts caused a sensation in new york city ussachevsky and luening were invited onto a live broadcast of nbc s today show to do an interview demonstration the first televised electroacoustic performance luening described the event i improvised some sequences for the tape recorder ussachevsky then and there put them through electronic transformations 1954 saw the advent of what would now be considered authentic electric plus acoustic compositions acoustic instrumentation augmented accompanied by recordings of manipulated and or electronically generated sound three major works were premiered that year varèse s déserts for chamber ensemble and tape sounds and two works by luening and ussachevsky rhapsodic variations for the louisville symphony and a poem in cycles and bells both for orchestra and tape because he had been working at schaeffer s studio the tape part for varèse s work contains much more concrete sounds than electronic a group made up of wind instruments percussion and piano alternates with mutated sounds of factory noises and ship sirens and motors coming from two loudspeakers déserts was premiered in paris in the first stereo broadcast on french radio at the german premiere in hamburg which was conducted by bruno maderna the tape controls were operated by karlheinz stockhausen the title déserts suggested to varèse not only all physical deserts but also the deserts in the mind of man not only those stripped aspects of nature that suggest bareness aloofness timelessness but also that remote inner space no telescope can reach where man is alone a world of mystery and essential loneliness an important new development was the advent of computers for the purpose of composing music as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds iannis xenakis began what is called musique stochastique or stochastic music which is a method of composing that employs mathematical probability systems different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters xenakis used graph paper and a ruler to aid in calculating the velocity trajectories of glissandi for his orchestral composition metastasis but later turned to the use of computers to compose pieces like st 4 for string quartet and st 48 for orchestra in 1954 stockhausen composed his elektronische studie ii the first electronic piece to be published as a score in 1955 more experimental and electronic studios began to appear notable were the creation of the studio de fonologia a studio at the nhk in tokyo founded by toshiro mayuzumi and the phillips studio at eindhoven the netherlands which moved to the university of utrecht as the institute of sonology in 1960 the score for forbidden planet by louis and bebe barron was entirely composed using custom built electronic circuits in 1956 the world s first computer to play music was csirac which was designed and built by trevor pearcey and maston beard mathematician geoff hill programmed the csirac to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s in 1951 it publicly played the colonel bogey march of which no known recordings exist however csirac played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice which is current computer music practice csirac was never recorded but the music played was accurately reconstructed the oldest known recordings of computer generated music were played by the ferranti mark i computer a commercial version of the baby machine from the university of manchester in the autumn of 1951 the music program was written by christopher strachey the impact of computers continued in 1956 lejaren hiller and leonard isaacson composed iliac suite for string quartet the first complete work of computer assisted composition using algorithmic composition  hiller postulated that a computer could be taught the rules of a particular style and then called on to compose accordingly later developments included the work of max mathews at bell laboratories who developed the influential music i program vocoder technology was also a major development in this early era in 1956 stockhausen composed gesang der jünglinge the first major work of the cologne studio based on a text from the book of daniel an important technological development of that year was the invention of the clavivox synthesizer by raymond scott with subassembly by robert moog the rca mark ii sound synthesizer made its debut in 1957 unlike the earlier theremin and ondes martenot it was difficult to use required extensive programming and could not be played in real time sometimes called the first electronic synthesizer the rca mark ii sound synthesizer used vacuum tube oscillators and incorporated the first electronic music sequencer driven by two punched paper tapes it was designed by rca and installed at the columbia princeton electronic music center where it remains to this day in 1957 music one of the first computer programs to play electronic music was created by max mathews at bell laboratories later milton babbitt influenced in his student years by schoenberg s revolution in musical thought began applying serial techniques to electronic music from 1950 to 1960 the vocabulary of tape music shifted from the fairly pure experimental works which characterized the classic paris and cologne schools to more complex and expressive works which explored a wide range of compositional styles more and more works began to appear by the mid 1950s which addressed the concept of combining taped sounds with live instruments and voices there was also a tentative interest and a few attempts at incorporating taped electronic sounds into theatrical works the public remained interested in the new sounds being created around the world as can be deduced by the inclusion of varèse s poeme electronique which was played over four hundred loudspeakers at the phillips pavilion of the 1958 brussels world fair that same year mauricio kagel an argentine composer composed transición ii the work was realized at the wdr studio in cologne two musicians perform on a piano one in the traditional manner the other playing on the strings frame and case two other performers use tape to unite the presentation of live sounds with the future of prerecorded materials from later on and its past of recordings made earlier in the performance these were fertile years for electronic music not just for academia but for independent artists as synthesizer technology became more accessible by this time a strong community of composers and musicians working with new sounds and instruments was established and growing 1960 witnessed the composition of luening s gargoyles for violin and tape as well as the premiere of stockhausen s kontakte for electronic sounds piano and percussion this piece existed in two versions one for 4 channel tape and the other for tape with human performers in kontakte stockhausen abandoned traditional musical form based on linear development and dramatic climax this new approach which he termed moment form resembles the cinematic splice techniques in early twentieth century film the first of these synthesizers to appear was the buchla appearing in 1963 it was the product of an effort spearheaded by musique concrète composer morton subotnick in 1962 working with a grant from the rockefeller foundation subotnick and business partner ramon sender hired electrical engineer don buchla to build a black box for composition the theremin had been in use since the 1920s but it attained a degree of popular recognition through its use in science fiction film soundtrack music in the 1950s during the 1960s the theremin made occasional appearances in popular music in the uk in this period the bbc radiophonic workshop emerged one of the most productive and widely known electronic music studios in the world thanks in large measure to their work on the bbc science fiction series doctor who one of the most influential british electronic artists in this period was workshop staffer delia derbyshire who added a keen musical ear to her great technical prowess she is famous for her landmark 1963 electronic realisation of the iconic doctor who theme composed by ron grainer arguably the most widely known piece of electronic music in the world derbyshire and her colleagues including dick mills brian hodgson david cain john baker paddy kingsland and peter howell collectively created a large and very varied body of work that includes station id stings program jingles soundtracks atmospheres and sound effects for bbc tv and radio stations and programs milton babbitt composed his first electronic work using the synthesizer his composition for synthesizer which he created using the rca synthesizer at cpemc for babbitt the rca synthesizer was a dream come true for three reasons first the ability to pinpoint and control every musical element precisely second the time needed to realize his elaborate serial structures were brought within practical reach third the question was no longer what are the limits of the human performer but rather what are the limits of human hearing the collaborations also occurred across oceans and continents in 1961 ussachevsky invited varèse to the columbia princeton studio upon arrival varese embarked upon a revision of déserts he was assisted by mario davidovsky and bülent arel the intense activity occurring at cpemc and elsewhere inspired the establishment of the san francisco tape music center in 1963 by morton subotnick with additional members pauline oliveros ramon sender terry riley and anthony martin the center soon incorporated a voltage controlled synthesizer based around automated sequencing by don buchla and used in album length subotnick pieces such as silver apples of the moon and the wild bull later the center moved to mills college directed by pauline oliveros where it is today known as the center for contemporary music back across the atlantic in czechoslovakia 1964 the first seminar of electronic music was held at the radio broadcast station in plzen four government sanctioned electroacoustic music studios were later established in the 1960s under the auspices of extant radio and television stations new instruments continued to develop one of the most significant breakthroughs came in 1964 when robert moog introduced the moog synthesizer the first integrated modular voltage controlled analog synthesiser system moog music later introduced a smaller synthesizer with a built in keyboard and hardwired signal path called the minimoog which was introduced to many composers and universities and beacme widely used by popular musicians a well known example of the use of moog s full sized moog modular synthesizer is the switched on bach album by wendy carlos which triggered a craze for synthesiser music this decade saw construction of more than 50 electronic music studios in the usa mostly in universities pietro grossi was an italian pioneer of computer composition and tape music who first experimented with electronic techniques in the early sixties grossi was a cellist and composer born in venice in 1917 he founded the s 2f m in 1963 in order to experiment with electronic sound and composition csirac the first computer to play music did so publicly in august 1951 one of the first large scale public demonstrations of computer music was a pre recorded national radio broadcast on the nbc radio network program monitor on february 10 1962 in 1961 lafarr stuart programmed iowa state university s cyclone computer to play simple recognizable tunes through an amplified speaker that had been attached to the system originally for administrative and diagnostic purposes an interview with mr stuart accompanied his computer music 
the late 1950s 1960s and 1970s also saw the development of large mainframe computer synthesis starting in 1957 max mathews of bell labs developed the music programs culminating in music v a direct digital synthesis language in america live electronics were pioneered in the early 1960s by members of milton cohen s space theater in ann arbor michigan including gordon mumma and robert ashley by individuals such as david tudor around 1965 and the sonic arts union founded in 1966 by gordon mumma robert ashley alvin lucier and david behrman once festivals featuring multimedia theater music were organized by robert ashley and gordon mumma in ann arbor between 1958 and 1969 in 1960 john cage composed cartridge music one of the earliest live electronic works in europe in 1964 karlheinz stockhausen composed mikrophonie i for tam tam hand held microphones filters and potentiometers and mixtur for orchestra four sine wave generators and four ring modulators in 1965 he composed mikrophonie ii for choir hammond organ and ring modulators in 1966 67 reed ghazala discovered and began to teach circuit bending the application of the creative short circuit a process of chance short circuiting creating experimental electronic instruments exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm and influenced by john cage s aleatoric music concept in 1970 charles wuorinen composed time s encomium the first pulitzer prize winner for an entirely electronic compositionreleased in 1970 by moog music the mini moog was among the first widely available portable and relatively affordable synthesizers it became the most widely used synthesizer in both popular and electronic art music ircam in paris became a major center for computer music research and realization and development of the sogitec 4x computer system featuring then revolutionary real time digital signal processing pierre boulez s répons for 24 musicians and 6 soloists used the 4x to transform and route soloists to a loudspeaker system throughout the seventies bands such as the residents and can spearheaded an experimental music movement that incorporated electronic sounds can were one of the first bands to use tape loops for rhythm sections and the residents created their own custom built drum machine the german band kraftwerk took a more purely electronic approach on records such as 1974 s autobahn other artists in the 1970s who composed primarily electronic instrumental music and managed to reach beyond the academic sphere and into the popular realm were jean michel jarre tangerine dream klaus schulze and vangelis also in the 1970s rock bands from genesis to the cars began incorporating synthesizers into traditional rock arrangements notably british synthesist brian eno collaborated with rock performers such as david bowie and roxy music in 1979 uk recording artist gary numan helped to bring electronic music into the wider marketplace of pop music with his hit cars from the album the pleasure principle other successful hit electronic singles in the early 1980s included don t you want me by the human league whip it by devo and finally 1983 s blue monday by new order which became the best selling 12 inch single of all time the swiss duo yello trevor horn s art of noise naked eyes prince kate bush peter gabriel and depeche mode further incorporated early samplers like the synclavier fairlight cmi and e mu emulator into their hit records by 1984 synthesizers and samplers were prominently featured in much popular music in 1980 a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface by which new instruments could communicate control instructions with other instruments and the prevalent microcomputer this standard was dubbed midi a paper was authored by dave smith of sequential circuits and proposed to the audio engineering society in 1981 then in august 1983 the midi specification 1 0 was finalized the advent of midi technology allows a single keystroke control wheel motion pedal movement or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer midi instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via sampling and sampled rom based instruments miller puckette developed graphic signal processing software for 4x called max and later ported it to macintosh for real time midi control bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background in 1979 the australian fairlight company released the fairlight cmi the first practical polyphonic digital synthesiser sampler system in 1983 yamaha introduced the first stand alone digital synthesizer the dx 7 it used frequency modulation synthesis first experimented with by john chowning at stanford during the late sixties barry vercoe describes one of his experiences with early computer sounds at ircam in paris in 1982 flutist larry beauregard had connected his flute to digiugno s 4x audio processor enabling real time pitch following on a guggenheim at the time i extended this concept to real time score following with automatic synchronized accompaniment and over the next two years larry and i gave numerous demonstrations of the computer as a chamber musician playing handel flute sonatas boulez s sonatine for flute and piano and by 1984 my own synapse ii for flute and computer the first piece ever composed expressly for such a setup a major challenge was finding the right software constructs to support highly sensitive and responsive accompaniment all of this was pre midi but the results were impressive even though heavy doses of tempo rubato would continually surprise my synthetic performer in 1985 we solved the tempo rubato problem by incorporating learning from rehearsals we were also now tracking violin since our brilliant young flautist had contracted a fatal cancer moreover this version used a new standard called midi and here i was ably assisted by former student miller puckette whose initial concepts for this task he later expanded into a program called max in the 1990s interactive computer assisted performance started to become possible with one example described as follows automated harmonization of melody in real time an interactive computer system developed in collaboration with flutist composer pedro eustache for realtime melodic analysis and harmonic accompaniment based on a novel scheme of harmonization devised by eustache the software analyzes the tonal melodic function of incoming notes and instantaneously performs an orchestrated harmonization of the melody the software was originally designed for performance by eustache on yamaha wx7 wind controller and was used in his composition tetelestai premiered in irvine california in march 1999 other recent developments included the tod machover composition begin again again for hypercello an interactive system of sensors measuring physical movements of the cellist max mathews developed the conductor program for real time tempo dynamic and timbre control of a pre input electronic score morton subotnick released a multimedia cd rom all my hummingbirds have alibis in recent years as computer technology has become more accessible and music software has advanced interacting with music production technology is now possible using means that bear no relationship to traditional musical performance practices for instance laptop performance and live coding in the last decade a number of software based virtual studio environments have emerged with products such as propellerhead s reason and ableton live finding popular appeal such tools provide viable and cost effective alternatives to typical hardware based production studios and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology it is now possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer such advances have for better or for worse democratized music creation leading to a massive increase in the amount of home produced electronic music available to the general public via the internet artists can now also individuate their production practice by creating personalized software synthesizers effects modules and various composition environments devices that once existed exclusively in the hardware domain can easily have virtual counterparts some of the more popular software tools for achieving such ends are commercial releases such as max msp and reaktor and freeware packages such as pure data supercollider and chuck a practice originally pioneered by reed ghazala in the 1960s it has recently found significant popular appeal circuit bending is the creative short circuiting of low voltage battery powered electronic audio devices such as guitar effects children s toys and small synthesizers to create new musical instruments and sound generators emphasizing spontaneity and randomness the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with noise music though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with bent instruments 
in musical notation a key signature is a series of sharp or flat symbols placed on the staff designating notes that are to be consistently played one semitone higher or lower than the equivalent natural notes unless otherwise altered with an accidental key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation although they can appear in other parts of a score notably after a double bar key signatures are generally used in a score to avoid the complication of having sharp or flat symbols on every instance of certain notes each major and minor key has an associated key signature that sharpens or flattens the notes which are used in its scale however it is not uncommon for a piece to be written with a key signature that does not match its key for example in some baroque pieces or in transcriptions of traditional modal folk tunes here is a b major scale written with accidentals and here is the same scale written using a key signature the purpose of the key signature is to minimize the number of accidentals required to notate the music in principle any piece can be written with any key signature using accidentals to correct any notes where it shouldn t apply the effect of a key signature continues throughout a piece or movement unless explicitly cancelled by another key signature for example if a five sharp key signature is placed at the beginning of a piece every a in the piece in any octave will be played as a sharp unless preceded by an accidental the sequence of sharps or flats in key signatures is generally rigid in music from the common practice period for example if a key signature has only one sharp it must be an f sharp the complete order is set out below exceptions may be found in klezmer scales such as freygish in the 20th century composers such as bartók and rzewski began experimenting with unusual key signatures that departed from the standard order the standard circle of fifths sequence is so firmly established that some musical notation programs are unable to show other key signatures in a score containing more than one instrument all the instruments are usually written with the same key signature exceptions a key signature is not the same as a key key signatures are merely notational devices they are convenient principally for diatonic or tonal music some pieces that change key insert a new key signature on the staff partway while others use accidentals natural signs to neutralize the key signature and other sharps or flats for the new key for a given musical mode the key signature defines the diatonic scale that a piece of music uses most scales require that some notes be consistently sharped or flatted for example the only sharp in the g major scale is f sharp so the key signature associated with the g major key is the one sharp key signature however the connection is not absolute a piece with a one sharp key signature is not necessarily in the key of g major and likewise a piece in g major may not always be written with a one sharp key signature this is particularly true of minor keys keys which are associated with the same key signature are called relative keys the famous dorian toccata and fugue by bach is so named because although it is in d minor there is no key signature implying that it is in the key of c instead the b flats necessary for d minor are written as accidentals when musical modes such as lydian or dorian are written using key signatures they are called transposed modes the use of a one flat signature developed in the medieval period but signatures with more than one flat did not appear until the 16th century and signatures with sharps not until the mid 17th century when signatures with multiple flats first came in the order of the flats was not standardized and often a flat appeared in two different octaves as shown at right in the late 1400s and early 1500s it was common for different voice parts in the same composition to have different signatures a situation called a partial signature or conflicting signature this was actually more common than complete signatures in the 15th century the 16th century motet absolon fili mi attributed to josquin desprez features two voice parts with two flats one part with three flats and one part with four flats baroque music written in minor keys often was written with a key signature with fewer flats than we now associate with their keys for example movements in c minor often had only two flats the table below illustrates the number of sharps or flats for each key signature and the relative major key signatures for minor scales remembering all the key signatures is easily done when you apply six simple rules alternatively starting from c major each sharp raises the key by a fifth and each flat lowers it by a fifth see the major key columns in the table the relative minor is a minor third down from the major regardless of whether it is a flat or a sharp key signature for key signatures with sharps the first sharp is placed on f line subsequent additional sharps are added on c g d a e and b for key signatures with flats the first flat is placed on the b line with subsequent flats on e a d g c and f a common mnemonic for remembering this is father charles goes down and ends battle for key signatures with sharps and vice versa for key signatures with flats battle ends and down goes charles father or father christmas gave dad an electric blanket and blanket exploded and dad got cold feet or farting causes great discomfort after eating beans respectively there are 15 possible different key signatures including the empty signature of c major a minor this sequence is rendered in the circle of fifths the key signatures with seven flats and seven sharps are very rarely used not only because pieces in these extreme sharp or flat keys are more difficult to play on most instruments but also because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents for example the key of c major is more simply represented as d major for modern practical purposes these keys are the same because c and d are the same note pieces are written in these extreme sharp or flat keys however for example bach s prelude and fugue no 3 from book 1 of the well tempered clavier bwv 848 is in c major the modern musical seussical by flaherty and ahrens also has several songs written in these more difficult keys however the aforementioned 15 key signatures only express diatonic scales other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidentals as required or with a non standard key signature such as the e and f g used for the e diminished scale in bartók s crossed hands or the b e f used for the d phrygian dominant scale in frederic rzewski s god to a hungry child note that an absence of a key signature does not always mean that the music is in the key of c major or a minor each accidental may be notated explicitly as required or the piece may be modal or atonal in order to remember which order that the sharps and flats of a key signature are written there are several mnemonics that can help the order of the sharps is father charles goes down and ends battle from this you can say that if you know a key of e major has four sharps the mnemonic shows which sharps they are the mnemonic for flats is battle ends and down goes charles father 
a remix is an alternative version of a song different from the original version a remixer uses audio mixing to compose an alternate master recording of a song adding or subtracting elements or simply changing the equalization dynamics pitch tempo playing time or almost any other aspect of the various musical components some remixes involve substantial changes to the arrangement of a recorded work but many are subtle such as creating a vocal up version of an album cut that emphasizes the lead singer s voice a song may be remixed to give a song that was not popular a second chance at radio and club play to create a stereo version of a recording that was previously only available in mono sound to improve the fidelity of an older recording in which the original mixdown tape has been lost or degraded or to alter a song to suit a specific music genre or radio format remixes should not be confused with edits which usually involve shortening a final stereo master for marketing purposes since the beginnings of recorded sound in the late 19th century certain people have enjoyed the ability to rearrange the normal listening experience with technology with the advent of easily editable magnetic tape in the 1940s and 1950s and the subsequent development of multitrack recording such alterations became more common in those decades the experimental genre of musique concrète used tape manipulation to create sound compositions less artistically lofty edits produced medleys or novelty recordings of various types modern remixing had its roots in the dance hall culture of late 1960s early 1970s jamaica the fluid evolution of music that encompassed ska rocksteady reggae and dub was embraced by local mixing wizards who deconstructed and rebuilt tracks to suit the tastes of their audience producers and engineers like ruddy redwood king tubby and lee scratch perry popularized stripped down instrumental mixes of reggae tunes at first they simply dropped the vocal tracks but soon more sophisticated effects were created dropping separate instrumental tracks in and out of the mix isolating and repeating hooks and adding various effects like echo reverberation and delay at the same time djs in early discotheques were performing similar tricks with disco songs to get dancers on the floor and keep them there one noteworthy figure was tom moulton who invented the dance remix as we now know it though not a dj mr moulton had begun his career by making a home made mix tape for a fire island dance club in the late 1960s his tapes eventually became popular and he came to the attention of the music industry in new york city at first moulton was simply called upon to improve the aesthetics of dance oriented recordings before release eventually he moved from being a fix it man on pop records to specializing in remixes for the dance floor along the way he invented the breakdown section and the 12 inch single vinyl format walter gibbons provided the dance version of the first commercial 12 inch single contrary to popular belief gibbons did not mix the record in fact his version was a re edit of the original mix moulton gibbons and their contemporaries at salsoul records proved to be the most influential group of remixers for the disco era the salsoul catalog is seen as being the canon for the disco mixer s art form pettibone is among a very small number of remixers whose work successfully transitioned from the disco era to the house era his contemporaries included arthur baker and francois kevorkian contemporaneously to disco in the mid 1970s the jamaican and bronx remix cultures met energizing both key figures included dj kool herc and grandmaster flash cutting and scratching became part of the culture creating what slate magazine called real time live action collage one of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track rockit by herbie hancock as remixed by grand mixer d st malcolm mclaren and the creative team behind ztt records would feature the cut up style of hip hop on such records as duck rock early pop remixes were fairly simple in the 1980s extended mixes of songs were released to clubs and commercial outlets on vinyl 12 inch singles these typically had a duration of six to seven minutes and often consisted of the original song with 8 or 16 bars of instruments inserted often after the second chorus some were as simplistic as two copies of the song stitched end to end as the cost and availability of new technologies allowed many of the bands who were involved in their own production experimented with more intricate versions of the extended mix madonna began her career writing music for dance clubs and used remixes extensively to propel her career one of her early boyfriends was noted dj john jellybean benitez who created several memorable mixes of her work art of noise took the remix styles to an extreme creating new music entirely using samples they were among the first popular groups to truly harness the potential that had been unleashed by kraftwerk and giorgio moroder with their synthesizer based compositions contemporaneous to art of noise was the seminal body of work by yello primarily because they featured sampled and sequenced sounds yello and art of noise would produce a great deal of influential work for the next phase others such as cabaret voltaire and the aforementioned jarre were equally influential in this era after the rise of dance music in the late 1980s a new form of remix was popularised where the vocals would be kept and the instruments would be replaced often with matching backing in the house music idiom a clear example of this approach is roberta flack s 1989 ballad uh oh look out which chicago house great steve silk hurley dramatically reworked into a boisterous floor filler by stripping away all the instrumental tracks and substituting a minimalist sequenced track to underpin her vocal delivery the art of the remix gradually evolved and soon avant garde artists such as aphex twin were creating more experimental remixes of songs which varied radically from their original sound and were not guided by pragmatic considerations such as sales or danceability but were created for art s sake in the 1990s with the rise of powerful home computers with audio capabilities came the mash up an unsolicited unofficial remix created by underground remixers who edit two or more recordings together underground mixing is more difficult than the typical official remix because clean copies of separated tracks such as vocals or individual instruments are usually not available to the public tosome artists embraced this trend and outspokenly sanctioned fan remixing of their work there was once a web site which hosted hundreds of unofficial remixes of björk s songs all made using only various officially sanctioned mixes other artists such as erasure have included remix software in their officially released singles allowing almost infinite permutations of remixes by users the band have also presided over remix competitions for their releases selecting their favourite fan created remix to appear on later official releases by 1998 stardust released the first ever song to use cut up style of remixing the song music sounds better with you reached the top of the electo music charts remixing has become very prevalent in heavily synthesized electronic and experimental music circles many of the people who create cutting edge music in such genres as synthpop futurepop and aggrotech are solo artists or pairs they will often use remixers to help them with skills or equipment that they do not have artists such as delobbo and dj ram are sought out for their remixing skill and have impressive lists of collaborations yet no solo albums it is not uncommon for industrial bands to release albums which have half the songs as remixes indeed there have been popular singles that have been expanded to an entire album of remixes by other well known artists some industrial groups allow and often encourage their fans to remix their music notably nine inch nails whose website contains a list of downloadable songs that can be remixed using apple s garageband software some artists have started releasing their songs in the u myx format which allows the buyers to mix songs and share them on the u myx website remixes have become the norm in modern dance music allowing one song the ability to appeal across many different musical genres or dancefloors such remixes often include featured artists adding new vocalists or musicians to the original mix the remix is also widely used in hip hop and rap music an r b remix usually has the same music as the original song but has added or altered verses that are rapped or sung by the featured artists it usually contains some if not all of the original verses of the song however these verses may be arranged in a different order depending on how the producers decided to remix the song in the early 1990s mariah carey became one of the first mainstream artists who re recorded vocals for a dancefloor version and by 1993 most of her major dance and urban targeted versions had been re sung e g dreamlover some artists would contribute new or additional vocals for the different versions of their songs these versions were not technically remixes as entirely new productions of the material were undertaken in 1988 sinead o connor s art rock song i want your was remixed to emphasize the urban appeal of the composition rapper m c lyte was asked to provide a guest rap and a new tradition was born in pop music george michael would feature three artistically differentiated arrangements of i want your sex in 1987 highlighting the potential of serial productions of a piece to find markets and expand the tastes of listeners in 1995 after doing california love which proved to be his best selling single ever tupac shakur would do its remix with dr dre again featured who originally wanted it for his next album but relented to let it be on the album all eyes on me instead this also included the reappearance of roger troutman also from the original but he ended the remix with an ab lib on the outro another well known example is r kelly who recorded two different versions of ignition for his 2003 album chocolate factory the song is unique in that it segues from the end of the original to the beginning of the remixed version in addition the original version s beginning line you remind me of something i just don t know what it is is actually sampled from an older kelly song you remind me of something madonna s i m breathless featured a remix of now i m following you that was used to segue from the original to vogue so that the latter could be added to the set without jarring the listener many hip hop remixes arose either from the need for a pop r b singer to add more of an urban rap edge to one of their slower songs or from the need for a rapper to gain more pop appeal by getting an r b singer to sing some lines here and there when a song by a solo artist does not take off a remix with additional performers can give the song a second chance slow ballads and r b songs can be remixed by techno producers and dj s in order to give the song appeal to the club scene and to urban radio conversely a more uptempo number can be mellowed to give it quiet storm appeal frankie knuckles saddled both markets with his def classic mixes often slowing the tempo slightly as he removed ornamental elements to soften the attack of a dancefloor filler these remixes proved hugely influential notably lisa stansfield s classic single change would be aired by urban radio in the knuckles version which had been provided as an alternative to the original mix by ian devaney and andy morris the record s producers some remixes are made by taking the vocals of one song and using a new beat as remixing has grown a whole new breed of artist has emerged often specializing in remixing one particular genre or artist this can be seen on such websites as beastiemixes com which specializes in hosting remixes of beastie boys soundtracks that have been concocted by remixers from all over the globe sometimes using other beastie boys tracks or even including such esoteric soundtracks as those from old horror movie soundtracks or particular themes john von seggern of the ethnomusicology department at the university of california riverside says that the remix is a major conceptual leap making music on a meta structural level drawing together and making sense of a much larger body of information by threading a continuous narrative through it this is what begins to emerge very early in the hiphop tradition in works such as grandmaster flash s pioneering mix recording adventures on the wheels of steel the importance of this cannot be overstated in an era of information overload the art of remixing and sampling as practiced by hiphop djs and producers points to ways of working with information on higher levels of organization pulling together the efforts of others into a multilayered multireferential whole which is much more than the sum of its parts a remix may also refer to a non linear re interpretation of a given work or media other than audio such as a hybridizing process combining fragments of various works the process of combining and re contextualizing will often produce unique results independent of the intentions and vision of the original designer artist thus the concept of a remix can be applied to visual or video arts and even things farther afield the disjointed novel house of leaves has been compared by some to the remix concept in recent years the concept of the remix has been applied analogously to other media and products in 2001 the british channel 4 television program jaaaaam was produced as a remix of the sketches from the comedy show jam in 2003 the coca cola corporation released a new version of their soft drink sprite with tropical flavors under the name sprite remix a remix in literature is an alternative version of a text william burroughs used the technique of remixing language in the 1960s in what he called cut ups  various textual sources would literally be cut into pieces with scissors rearranged on a page and pasted to form new sentences new ideas new stories and new ways of thinking about words naked lunch is a popular example of an early novel that used this technique of remixing language remixing of literature and language is also apparent in pixel juice by jeff noon who later explained using different methods for this process with cobralingus nigel tomm s self published remixes of shakespeare s work are shakespeare s sonnets remixed shakespeare s hamlet remixed shakespeare s romeo and juliet remixed because remixes may borrow heavily from an existing piece of music the issue of intellectual property becomes a concern the most important question is whether a remixer is free to redistribute his or her work or whether the remix falls under the category of a derivative work according to united states copyright law of note are open questions concerning the legality of visual works like the art form of collage which can be plagued with licensing issues there are two obvious extremes with regard to derivative works if the song is substantively dissimilar in form then it may not necessarily be a derivative work on the other hand if the remixer only changes a few things then it is clearly a derivative work and subject to the copyrights of the original work s copyright holder the creative commons non profit group created the ccmixter website to provide remixers with creative material licensed for remixers to use with permission a number of netlabels similarly have used liberal licensing to facilitate remixing

multitrack recording is a method of sound recording that allows for the separate recording of multiple sound sources to create a cohesive whole this is the most common method of recording popular music in the 2000s multitracking software for computers such as pro tools became widely used multitracking can be achieved with analog tape based equipment digital equipment that relies on tape storage of recorded digital data and hard disk based systems often employing a computer and audio recording software multitrack recording devices vary in their specifications such as the number of simultaneous tracks available for recording at any one time in the case of tape based systems this is limited by among other factors the physical size of the tape employed some of the biggest professional analog recording studios used a computer to synchronize multiple 24 track machines effectively multiplying the number of available tracks into the hundreds the rock group toto recorded their fourth album on four computer synced 24 track machines for example for computer based systems the trend is towards unlimited numbers of record playback tracks although issues such as memory and cpu available will in fact limit this from machine to machine moreover on computer based systems the number of simultaneously available recording tracks is limited by the sound card discrete analog or digital inputs when recording audio engineers can select which track on the device will be used for each instrument voice or other input at any given point on the tape any of the tracks on the recording device can be recording or playing back so that an artist is able to record for instance onto track 2 and simultaneously listen to track 1 allowing them to sing or to play an accompaniment to the performance already recorded on track 1 they might then record on track 3 while listening to track 2 all three performances can then be played back in perfect synchrony as if they had originally been played and recorded together this can be repeated until all of the available tracks have been used or in some cases reused at any given point in the recording process any number of existing tracks can be bounced into one or two tracks and the original tracks erased making more room for more tracks to be reused for fresh recording beatles producer george martin used this technique extensively to achieve multiple track results while still being limited to using only multiple four track machines until an eight track machine became available during the recording of the beatles white album the beach boys pet sounds also made innovative use of multitracking with 8 track machines of the day multitrack recording also allows any recording artist to record multiple takes of any given section of their performance allowing them to refine their performance to virtual perfection a recording engineer can record only the section being worked on without erasing any other section of that track this process of turning the recording mechanism on and off is called punching in and punching out when recording is completed the many tracks are mixed down through a mixing console to a two track stereo recorder in a format which can then be duplicated and distributed most of the records cds and cassettes commercially available in a music store are recordings that were originally recorded on multiple tracks and then mixed down to stereo in some rare cases as when an older song is technically updated these stereo mixes can in turn be recorded onto two tracks of a multitrack recorder allowing additional sound to be layered on the remaining tracks during multitracking multiple musical instruments can be recorded either one at a time or simultaneously onto individual tracks so that the sounds thus recorded can be accessed processed and manipulated individually to produce the desired results for example after recording some parts of a song an artist might listen to only the guitar part by muting all the tracks except the one on which the guitar was recorded if they then wanted to listen to the vocals in isolation they would do so by muting all the tracks apart from the vocals track if they wanted to listen to the entire song they could do so by un muting all the tracks if they did not like the guitar part or found a mistake in it and wanted to replace it they could do so by re recording only the guitar part rather than re recording the entire song this kind of editing freedom is one of the biggest benefits of multitracking if all the voices and instruments in a recording are individually recorded on distinct tracks then the artist is able to retain complete control over the final sculpting of the song during the mix down phase for example if an artist wanted to apply one effect to a synthesizer part a different effect to a guitar part a chorused reverb effect to the lead vocals and different effects to all the drums and percussion instruments they could not do so if they had all been originally recorded together onto the same track however if they had been recorded onto separate tracks then the artist could blend and alter all of the instrument s sounds with complete freedom multitrack recording allows a single musician to record multiple parts allowing duos and trios to produce a larger sound larger groups to double parts or add different instruments and also a solo performer to create an ensemble sound playing different parts marvin gaye john frusciante mike oldfield stevie wonder emitt rhodes skip spence paul mccartney todd rundgren trent reznor lenny kravitz elliott smith david gray r stevie moore enya dave grohl delbert mcclinton michael sembello ben folds kurt ralske and prince are among the performers to produce albums in this way as their own band even a musician who plays no instruments can create a marketable record as with a cappella artist bobby mcferrin who performed all of the parts in many of his recordings vocally multitracking a song also leaves open the possibilities of remixes by the same or future artists such as djs if the song was not available in a multitrack format recording the job of the remixing artist could be very difficult or impossible because once the tracks have been re recorded together during the mixdown phase they are inseparable theoretically one could use frequency selective filters for this but in reality this has not been done with any great degree of success because of the multi harmonic nature of many musical instruments and voices the process was conceived and developed by guitarist les paul in the 1940s with the financial and inspirational assistance of bing crosby and the ampex corporation resulting in the first 8 track machine which used 1 inch tape through the 1950s many popular recordings notably those of les paul and mary ford and patti page used the technology to enhance vocals and instrumentals from these pioneering beginnings it evolved in subsequent decades into a mainstream recording technique in the 2000s many performers have recorded albums using only a personal computer as a tracking machine to use a personal computer as a multitracking device the computer must have an analog to digital interface and multitrack recording software must be installed as well a microphone is needed to record the vocals of a singer and or any other sources of sound this is all that is needed to set up a multitracking studio at home capable of producing high quality recordings the standard analog to digital interface in a personal computer can be used to capture sounds this is done simply by attaching either a microphone to the microphone input jack if a vocal track is to be recorded or a stereo cable from the electronic device to the line input of the sound card computers with appropriate software and hardware can record multiple audio tracks at once this audio interface hardware sends audio signals to the computer and may interface with the computer via a pci card usb or firewire connections there are a range of analog to digital interface options available popular brands include apogee digidesign motu lynx and prism the instruments and singers voices are recorded onto individual files on the computer s hard drive which function as tracks as per traditional multitracking effects such as reverb chorus delays can be applied by the computer software when the musicians are happy with the sound the multiple tracks are mixed down onto two clean tracks again within the multitracking software finally the final stereo recording can be burned to a cd which can then be copied and distributed multitracking software for a personal computer includes adobe audition pro tools from digidesign sonar from cakewalk samplitude from magix cubase from steinberg and logic pro from apple mixcraft from acoustica inc reaper from cockos and n track from fasoft are affordable alternatives to high end multi track software audacity and ardour are popular open source programs for multi track recording jokosher is quite new but seems to be gaining popularity among linux users 2007 song galaxy has released an audio multi track format that is delivered in a single file which loaded into the player software gives the user the ability to mute or adjust the volume level of individual instruments tracks can be exported as individual wav files which can then be loaded into other multitracking software for further editing in most modern popular songs drums and percussion instruments are the first instruments to be recorded there are various reasons for this the drums are usually the rhythm leaders it is much easier for musicians recording later tracks to keep to the common beat of the drums also due to the precise attack of drum sounds a drummer might find it very difficult to play along with a backing track recorded without percussion due to the likely variations in the musicians tempo furthermore in order to accurately keep to a pre established rhythm a drummer would need the sound of the other instruments to be very loud to compete with their drum kit apart from the possibility of the drum microphones picking up the sound of the other instruments from the drummer s headphones prolonged exposure to such volume might very well damage their hearing also it allows the drums to be recorded for a few seconds then looped click tracks are also often used as the first sound to be recorded especially when the drummer isn t available for the initial recording and or the final mix will be synchronized with motion picture and or video images also though the drums might eventually be mixed down to a couple of tracks each individual drum and percussion instrument might be initially recorded to its own individual track the drums and percussion combined can occupy the largest number of tracks utilized in a recording this is done so that each percussion instrument can be processed individually for maximum effect a common percussion effect is the slow back and forth panning of a percussive instrument s sound in the stereo field from the left to the right channel in a song equalization is often used on individual drums to bring out each one s characteristic sound the last tracks to be recorded are usually the vocals one reason for this is that singers will often temper their vocal expression in accordance with the accompaniment for classical and jazz recordings where multitracking is chosen as the recording method a different arrangement is used all tracks are recorded simultaneously sound barriers are often placed between different groups within the orchestra e g pianists violinists percussionists etc when barriers are used these groups listen to each other via headphones

cymatics is the study of wave phenomena it is typically associated with the physical patterns produced through the interaction of sound waves in a medium a simple experiment demonstrating the visualisation of cymatics can be done by sprinkling sand on a metal plate and vibrating the plate for example by drawing a violin bow along the edge the sand will then form itself into standing wave patterns such as simple concentric circles the higher the frequency the more complex the shapes produced with certain shapes having similarities to traditional mandala designs the study of the patterns produced by vibrating bodies has a venerable history one of the earliest to notice that an oscillating body displayed regular patterns was galileo galilei who wrote in his 1632 book dialogue concerning the two chief world systems as i was scraping a brass plate with a sharp iron chisel in order to remove some spots from it and was running the chisel rather rapidly over it i once or twice during many strokes heard the plate emit a rather strong and clear whistling sound on looking at the plate more carefully i noticed a long row of fine streaks parallel and equidistant from one another scraping with the chisel over and over again i noticed that it was only when the plate emitted this hissing noise that any marks were left upon it when the scraping was not accompanied by this sibilant note there was not the least trace of such marks on july 8 1680 robert hooke was able to see the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates hooke ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour and saw the nodal patterns emerge in 1787 ernst chladni repeated the work of robert hooke and published entdeckungen über die theorie des klanges in this book chladni describes the patterns seen by placing sand on metal plates which are made to vibrate by stroking the edge of the plate with a bow the term cymatics was coined by the swiss scientist hans jenny it is derived from the greek kyma meaning wave and ta kymatika meaning matters pertaining to waves cymatics was explored by jenny in his 1967 book kymatik inspired by systems theory and the work of ernst chladni jenny began an investigation of periodic phenomena but especially the visual display of sound he used standing waves piezoelectric amplifiers and other methods and materials jenny s book influenced alvin lucier and along with chladni helped lead to lucier s composition queen of the south jenny s work was also followed up by center for advanced visual studies founder gyorgy kepes at mit his work in this area included an acoustically vibrated piece of sheet metal in which small holes had been drilled in a grid small flames of gas burned through these holes and thermodynamic patterns were made visible by this setup based on work done in this field photographer alexander lauterwasser captures imagery of water surfaces set into motion by sound sources ranging from pure sine waves to music by ludwig van beethoven karlheinz stockhausen electroacoustic group kymatik and overtone singing

klaus schulze is a german electronic music composer and musician he also used the alias richard wahnfried he was briefly a member of the electronic bands tangerine dream and ash ra tempel before launching a solo career consisting of more than 40 albums lasting over 3 decades in 1969 klaus schulze was the drummer of one of the early incarnations of tangerine dream for their debut album electronic meditation in 1970 he left this group to form ash ra tempel with manuel göttsching in 1971 he chose again to leave a newly formed group after only one album this time to mount a solo career in 1972 schulze released his debut album irrlicht with organ and a recording of an orchestra filtered almost beyond recognition despite the lack of synthesizers this proto ambient work is regarded as a milestone in electronic music the follow up cyborg was similar but added the ems synthi a synthesizer he has had a prolific career with more than 40 original albums to his name since irrlicht some highlights being 1976 s moondawn 1979 s dune and 1995 s double album in blue he often takes german events as a starting point in his compositions particularly on his album x in 1978 which was subtitled six musical biographies including such notables as ludwig ii of bavaria friedrich nietzsche and wilhelm friedemann bach his use of the pseudonym richard wahnfried indicates his interest in richard wagner which also informs other albums of his music notably timewind throughout the 1970s he worked mostly in the musical vein of the above mentioned tangerine dream albeit with far lighter sequencer lines and a more reflective dreamy edge not unlike the ambient music of contemporary brian eno some of his lighter albums are appreciated by new age music fans but schulze has always denied connections to this genre klaus schulze had a more organic sound than other electronic artists of the time often he would throw in decidedly non electronic sounds such as acoustic guitar and a male operatic voice in blackdance or a cello in dune and trancefer schulze developed a minimoog technique that sounds uncannily like an electric guitar which is quite impressive in concert in the 1980s schulze moved from analog to digital instruments and his work accordingly became less experimental and more accessible although the switch to purely digital recording and instruments is evident in the style of dig it it was not until the release of trancefer that the shift in style became evident trancefer was far more obviously reliant on sequencers than previous recordings and the resultant effect transformed schulze s style from gentle melodic journeys to and ever growing crescendo of music consisting of multi layered rhythmical passages this is particularly evident in the trancefer s first track a few moments after trancefer although the second track silent running is more reminiscent of schulze s earlier works this newer style can also be found in schulze s next release audentity both cellistica and spielglocken are composed in a similar sequencer based style as trancefer but this is certainly not the case of all of audentity s tracks indeed sebastian in traum hints towards the operatic style to be found in some of schulze s much later work the predominance of sequencing can also be found in the follow up live album dziekuje poland live 83 although it should be noted that many of its tracks are re workings of those to be found on audentity schulze s next studio based album angst moved away from the harshness of sharp heavily sequenced style of the 3 previous albums and once again had the more organic feel of earlier recordings another highlight of this era was en trance with the dreamy cut fm delight the album miditerranean pads marked the beginning of very complex percussion arrangements that continued into the next two decades starting with beyond recall the first half of the 1990s was the notorious sample period when schulze used a variety of pre recorded sounds of screeching birds and sensuous female moans in his studio albums and live performances sampling was such an unpopular diversion that when in blue was released in 1995 without samples it was hailed as a return to form the decade also saw the release of copious amounts of previously unreleased material of varying quality in several limited edition boxed sets some live recordings were discovered on pristine but forgotten reels of tape which had been used to provide echo in concerts recently schulze began incorporating elements of jazz and classical music working with more contemporary techno dance music such as trance and creating two opera the second still awaiting release also in 2005 he began re releasing his classic solo and wahnfried albums with bonus tracks of unreleased material recorded at roughly the same time as the original works june 2007 klaus schulze released a new album entitled kontinuum both klaus schulze and lisa gerrard have produced an album called farscape released in july 2008 later that month schulze and gerrard appeared at an open air music festival on the loreley rock in germany richard wahnfried then simply wahnfried after 1993 is

of the wahnfried albums are the pseudonym s etymology stems from schulze s love for richard wagner in his 1975 album timewind schulze had already named a track wahnfried 1883 the other track on timewind is called bayreuth return after 1993 the albums are simply credited to wahnfried and namedrop schulze wahnfried is the only known alias of schulze schulze s concert performances are original compositions recorded live and thus listed as albums in 2005 an intensive re release program of schulze cds started mostly with extended or bonus tracks sometimes a whole additional cd they are

 joseph haydn was an austrian composer he was one of the most prominent composers of the classical period and is called by some the father of the symphony and father of the string quartet a life long citizen of austria haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy hungarian esterházy family on their remote estate isolated from other composers and trends in music until the later part of his long life he was as he put it forced to become original during his lifetime the composer was always known as joseph haydn the form franz joseph haydn is avoided by modern scholars and historians joseph haydn was the brother of michael haydn himself a highly regarded composer and johann evangelist haydn a tenor joseph haydn was born in rohrau austria a village near the border with hungary his father was mathias haydn a wheelwright who also served as marktrichter an office akin to village mayor haydn s mother the former maria koller had previously worked as a cook in the palace of count harrach the presiding aristocrat of rohrau neither parent could read music however mathias was an enthusiastic folk musician who during the journeyman period of his career had taught himself to play the harp according to haydn s later reminiscences his childhood family was extremely musical and frequently sang together and with their neighbours haydn s parents had noticed that their son was musically talented and knew that in rohrau he would have no chance to obtain any serious musical training it was for this reason that they accepted a proposal from their relative johann matthias frankh the schoolmaster and choirmaster in hainburg that haydn be apprenticed to frankh in his home to train as a musician haydn therefore went off with frankh to hainburg and never again lived with his parents he was six years old life in the frankh household was not easy for haydn who later remembered being frequently hungry as well as constantly humiliated by the filthy state of his clothing however he did begin his musical training there and soon was able to play both harpsichord and violin the people of hainburg were soon hearing him sing treble parts in the church choir there is reason to think that haydn s singing impressed those who heard him because two years later he was brought to the attention of georg von reutter the director of music in st stephen s cathedral in vienna who was touring the provinces looking for talented choirboys haydn passed his audition with reutter and soon moved off to vienna where he worked for the next nine years as a chorister the last four in the company of his younger brother michael like franck before him reutter did not always bother to make sure haydn was properly fed the young haydn greatly looked forward to performances before aristocratic audiences where the singers sometimes had the opportunity to satisfy their hunger by devouring the refreshments reutter also did little to further his choristers musical education however st stephen s was at the time one of the leading musical centers in europe with many performances of new music by leading composers haydn was able to learn a great deal by observation simply by serving as a professional musician there by 1749 haydn had finally matured physically to the point that he was no longer able to sing high choral parts on a weak pretext he was summarily dismissed from his job he was sent into the streets with no home to go to however he had the good fortune to be taken in by a friend johann michael spangler who for a few months shared with haydn his family s crowded garret room haydn was able to begin immediately his pursuit of a career as a freelance musician during this arduous time haydn worked at many different jobs as a music teacher as a street serenader and eventually as valet accompanist for the italian composer nicola porpora from whom he later said he learned the true fundamentals of composition when he was a chorister haydn had not received serious training in music theory and composition which he perceived as a serious gap to fill it he worked his way through the counterpoint exercises in the text gradus ad parnassum by johann joseph fux and carefully studied the work of carl philipp emanuel bach whom he later acknowledged as an important influence as his skills increased haydn began to acquire a public reputation first as the composer of an opera der krumme teufel the limping devil written for the comic actor johann joseph felix kurz whose stage name was bernardon the work was premiered successfully in 1753 but was soon closed down by the censors haydn also noticed apparently without annoyance that works he had simply given away were being published and sold in local music shops with the increase in his reputation haydn eventually was able to obtain aristocratic patronage crucial for the career of a composer in his day countess thun having seen one of haydn s compositions summoned him and engaged him as her singing and keyboard teacher baron carl josef fürnberg employed haydn at his country estate weinzierl where the composer wrote his first string quartets fürnberg later recommended haydn to count morzin who in 1757 became his first full time employer haydn s job title under count morzin was kapellmeister that is music director he led the count s small orchestra and wrote his first symphonies for this ensemble in 1760 with the security of a kapellmeister position haydn married his wife was the former maria anna aloysia apollonia keller the sister of therese with whom haydn had previously been in love haydn and his wife had a completely unhappy marriage from which the laws of the time permitted them no escape and they produced no children both took lovers count morzin soon suffered financial reverses that forced him to dismiss his musical establishment but haydn was quickly offered a similar job as vice kapellmeister to the esterházy family one of the wealthiest and most important in the austrian empire when the old kapellmeister gregor werner died in 1766 haydn was elevated to full kapellmeister as a house officer in the esterházy establishment haydn wore livery and followed the family as they moved among their various palaces most importantly the family s ancestral seat schloss esterházy in eisenstadt and later on eszterháza a grand new palace built in rural hungary in the 1760s haydn had a huge range of responsibilities including composition running the orchestra playing chamber music for and with his patrons and eventually the mounting of operatic productions despite this workload the job was in artistic terms a superb opportunity for haydn the esterházy princes were musical connoisseurs who appreciated his work and gave him daily access to his own small orchestra during the nearly thirty years that haydn worked at the esterházy court he produced a flood of compositions and his musical style continued to develop his popularity in the outside world also increased gradually haydn came to write as much for publication as for his employer and several important works of this period such as the paris symphonies and the original orchestral version of the seven last words of christ were commissions from abroad haydn also gradually came to feel more isolated and lonely particularly as the court came to spend most of the year at esterháza far from vienna rather than the closer by eisenstadt haydn particularly longed to visit vienna because of his friendships there of these a particularly important one was with maria anna von genzinger the wife of prince nikolaus s personal physician in vienna who began a close platonic relationship with the composer in 1789 haydn wrote to mrs genzinger often expressing his loneliness at eszterháza and his happiness for the few occasions on which he was able to visit her in vienna later on haydn wrote to her frequently from london her premature death in 1793 was a blow to haydn and his f minor variations for piano hob xvii 6 may have been written in response to her death another friend in vienna was wolfgang amadeus mozart whom haydn met sometime around 1784 according to later testimony by michael kelly and others the two composers occasionally played in string quartets together haydn was hugely impressed with mozart s work and praised it unstintingly to others mozart evidently returned the esteem as seen in his dedication of a set of six quartets now called the haydn quartets to his friend for further details see haydn and mozart in 1790 prince nikolaus died and was succeeded by a thoroughly unmusical prince who dismissed the entire musical establishment and put haydn on a pension freed of his obligations haydn was able to accept a lucrative offer from johann peter salomon a german impresario to visit england and conduct new symphonies with a large orchestra the visit along with a repeat visit was a huge success audiences flocked to haydn s concerts haydn augmented his fame and made large profits thus becoming financially secure charles burney reviewed the first concert thus haydn himself presided at the piano forte and the sight of that renowned composer so electrified the audience as to excite an attention and a pleasure superior to any that had ever been caused by instrumental music in england musically the visits to england generated some of haydn s best known work including the surprise military drumroll and london symphonies the rider quartet and the gypsy rondo piano trio the only misstep in the venture was an opera orfeo ed euridice also called l anima del filosofo which haydn was contracted to compose but whose performance was blocked by intrigues haydn made many new friends and was involved for a time in a romantic relationship with rebecca schroeter between visits haydn taught ludwig van beethoven beethoven found him unsatisfactory as a teacher and sought help from others the relationship between the two was sometimes rather tense for discussion of their relationship see beethoven and his contemporaries haydn returned to vienna in 1795 moved into a large house in the suburb of gumpendorf and turned to the composition of large religious works for chorus and orchestra these include his two great oratorios and six masses for the eszterházy family which by this time was once again headed by a musically inclined prince haydn also composed instrumental music the popular trumpet concerto and the last nine in his long series of string quartets including the fifths emperor and sunrise quartets in 1802 an illness from which haydn had been suffering for some time had increased in severity to the point that he became physically unable to compose this was doubtless very difficult for him because as he acknowledged the flow of fresh musical ideas waiting to be worked out as compositions did not cease haydn was well cared for by his servants and he received many visitors and public honours during his last years but they could not have been very happy years for him during his illness haydn often found solace by sitting at the piano and playing gott erhalte franz den kaiser which he had composed himself as a patriotic gesture in 1797 this melody later was used for the austrian and german national anthems haydn died at the end of may in 1809 shortly after an attack on vienna by the french army under napoleon he was 77 among his last words was his attempt to calm and reassure his servants when cannon shot fell in the neighborhood my children have no fear for where haydn is no harm can fall two weeks later a memorial service was held in the schottenkirche on june 15 1809 at which mozart s requiem was performed james webster writes of haydn s public character thus haydn s public life exemplified the enlightenment ideal of the honnête homme the man whose good character and worldly success enable and justify each other his modesty and probity were everywhere acknowledged these traits were not only prerequisites to his success as kapellmeister entrepreneur and public figure but also aided the favourable reception of his music haydn was especially respected by the eszterházy court musicians whom he supervised as he maintained a cordial working atmosphere and effectively represented the musicians interests with their employer see papa haydn and the tale of the farewell symphony haydn had a robust sense of humor evident in his love of practical jokes and often apparent in his music and he had many friends for much of his life he benefited from a happy and naturally cheerful temperament but in his later life there is evidence for periods of depression notably in the correspondence with mrs genzinger and in dies s biography based on visits made in haydn s old age haydn was a devout catholic who often turned to his rosary when he had trouble composing a practice that he usually found to be effective he normally began the manuscript of each composition with in nomine domini and ended with laus deo haydn was short in stature perhaps as a result of having been underfed throughout most of his youth he was not handsome and like many in his day he was a survivor of smallpox his face being pitted with the scars of this disease his early biographer albert christoph dies wrote he couldn t understand how it happened that in his life he had been loved by many a pretty woman they couldn t have been led to it by my beauty haydn also suffered from nasal polyposis for much of his adult life this was an agonizing and debilitating disease in the 18th century and at times it prevented him from writing music james webster summarizes haydn s role in the history of classical music as follows he excelled in every musical genre he is familiarly known as the father of the symphony and could with greater justice be thus regarded for the string quartet no other composer approaches his combination of productivity quality and historical importance in these genres a central characteristic of haydn s music is the development of larger structures out of very short simple musical motifs often derived from standard accompanying figures the music is often quite formally concentrated and the important musical events of a movement can unfold rather quickly haydn s work was central to the development of what came to be called sonata form his practice however differed in some ways from that of mozart and beethoven his younger contemporaries who likewise excelled in this form of composition haydn was particularly fond of the so called monothematic exposition in which the music that establishes the dominant key is similar or identical to the opening theme haydn also differs from mozart and beethoven in his recapitulation sections where he often rearranges the order of themes compared to the exposition and uses extensive thematic development haydn s formal inventiveness also led him to integrate the fugue into the classical style and to enrich the rondo form with more cohesive tonal logic haydn was also the principal exponent of the double variation form variations on two alternating themes which are often major and minor mode versions of each other perhaps more than any other composer s haydn s music is known for its humor the most famous example is the sudden loud chord in the slow movement of his surprise symphony haydn s many other musical jokes include numerous false endings and the remarkable rhythmic illusion placed in the trio section of the third movement of op 50 no 1 much of the music was written to please and delight a prince and its emotional tone is correspondingly upbeat this tone also reflects perhaps haydn s fundamentally healthy and well balanced personality occasional minor key works often deadly serious in character form striking exceptions to the general rule haydn s fast movements tend to be rhythmically propulsive and often impart a great sense of energy especially in the finales some characteristic examples of haydn s rollicking finale type are found in the london symphony no 104 the string quartet op 50 no 1 and the piano trio hob xv 27 haydn s early slow movements are usually not too slow in tempo relaxed and reflective later on the emotional range of the slow movements increases notably in the deeply felt slow movements of the quartets op 76 nos 3 and 5 symphony no 102 and piano trio hob xv 23 the minuets tend to have a strong downbeat and a clearly popular character as early as op 33 haydn turned some of his minuets into scherzi which are much faster at one beat to the bar haydn s early work dates from a period in which the compositional style of the high baroque had gone out of fashion this was a period of exploration and uncertainty and haydn born 18 years before the death of bach was himself one of the musical explorers of this time an older contemporary whose work haydn acknowledged as an important influence was carl philipp emanuel bach tracing haydn s work over the six decades in which it was produced one finds a gradual but steady increase in complexity and musical sophistication which developed as haydn learned from his own experience and that of his colleagues several important landmarks have been observed in the evolution of haydn s musical style in the late 1760s and early 1770s haydn entered a stylistic period known as sturm und drang this term is taken from a literary movement of about the same time though it appears that the musical development actually preceded the literary one by a few years the musical language of this period is similar to what went before but it is deployed in work that is more intensely expressive especially in the works in minor keys james webster describes the works of this period as longer more passionate and more daring some of the most famous compositions of this time are the farewell symphony no 45 the piano sonata in c minor and the six string quartets of op 20 all from 1772 it was also around this time that haydn became interested in writing fugues in the baroque style and three of the op 20 quartets end with such fugues following the climax of the sturm und drang haydn returned to a lighter more overtly entertaining style there are no quartets from this period and the symphonies take on new features the first movements now sometimes contain slow introductions and the scoring often includes trumpets and timpani these changes are often related to a major shift in haydn s professional duties which moved him away from pure music and toward the production of comic operas which were very popular in 18th century italy several of the operas were haydn s own work these are seldom performed today haydn sometimes recycled his opera music in symphonic works which helped him continue his career as a symphonist during this hectic decade in 1779 an important change in haydn s contract permitted him to publish his compositions without prior authorization from his employer this may have encouraged haydn to rekindle his career as a composer of pure music the change made itself felt most dramatically in 1781 when haydn published the six string quartets of opus 33 announcing that they were written in a completely new and special way charles rosen has argued that this assertion on haydn s part was not just sales talk but meant quite seriously and he points out a number of important advances in haydn s compositional technique that appear in these quartets advances that mark the advent of the classical style in full flower these include a fluid form of phrasing in which each motif emerges from the previous one without interruption the practice of letting accompanying material evolve into melodic material and a kind of classical counterpoint in which each instrumental part maintains its own integrity these traits continue in the many quartets that haydn wrote after opus 33 in the 1790s stimulated by his england journeys haydn developed what rosen calls his popular style a way of composition that with unprecedented success created music having great popular appeal but retaining a learned and rigorous musical structure an important element of the popular style was the frequent use of folk or folk like material as discussed in the article haydn and folk music haydn took care to deploy this material in appropriate locations such as the endings of sonata expositions or the opening themes of finales in such locations the folk material serves as an element of stability helping to anchor the larger structure haydn s popular style can be heard in virtually all of his later work including the twelve london symphonies the late quartets and piano trios and the two late oratorios the return to vienna in 1795 marked the last turning point in haydn s career although his musical style evolved little his intentions as a composer changed while he had been a servant and later a busy entrepreneur haydn wrote his works quickly and in profusion with frequent deadlines as a rich man haydn now felt he had the privilege of taking his time and writing for posterity this is reflected in the subject matter of the creation and the seasons which address such weighty topics as the meaning of life and the purpose of humankind and represent an attempt to render the sublime in music haydn s new intentions also meant that he was willing to spend much time on a single work both oratorios took him over a year to complete haydn once remarked that he had worked on the creation so long because he wanted it to last the change in haydn s approach was important in the history of music as other composers soon were following his lead notably beethoven adopted the practice of taking his time and aiming high haydn s works are listed in a comprehensive catalogue prepared by anthony van hoboken this hoboken catalogue provides each work with an identifying number called its hoboken number the string quartets also have hoboken numbers but are usually identified instead by their opus numbers which have the advantage of indicating the groups of six quartets that haydn published together thus for example the string quartet opus 76 no 3 is the third of the six quartets published in 1799 as opus 76

mother from whom he inherited a love of dressmaking after attending melbourne high school and one year of a fashion course there he abandoned australia and moved to london for good in 1980 initially to make his career as a fashion designer although this was a financial failure it did garner him a small cult following and media interest eventually he was making a name for himself by dramatic performances of dance music and extreme exhibitionism while wearing bizarre and very original outfits of his own design he befriended two leading clubbers trojan later a painter and david walls later of the design team gallagher walls bowery moved in with them to a houseshare in ladbroke grove and the two men became the first people in london to wear bowery s creative designs collectively they were nicknamed the three kings they were unemployed for several years and living on benefit which was common in those days and were eventually rehoused on the commercial road in the east end in a three bedroom flat high on the 11th floor of a council tower block in one of the poorest and bleakest areas of london all three would experiment with drugs but within the year and after a huge fallout david walls moved out leaving bowery and trojan to live together at this time bowery and trojan briefly became lovers but split soon after on trojan s insistence at this time margaret thatcher was in power and although they were making a good living times were hard for bowery without a trust fund the only escape was in the secret underworld of often polysexual or gay nightclubs up until 1986 bowery would describe himself as a fashion designer and club promoter although his early fashion career is often ignored he had considerable artistic success and it included several collections in london fashion week shows at the ica the camden palace new york and tokyo in january 1985 he started the now infamous polysexual thursday disco club night taboo originally an underground venture it quickly became london s studio 54 only much wilder extremely more fashionable and without the masses of celebrities although these came flocking in later for everyone stepping through the doors it was a truly unforgettable experience over the coming years he was invited to host numerous club nights in new york tokyo rome and elsewhere contrary to popular belief bowery was not part of the new romantic movement that was popular in britain during the early 1980s though perhaps he is more properly placed within the context of early fashion clubs such as cha cha s at heaven and the hard times movement he was always at the centre of the pansexual set of young and fashionable londoners from being a plump studious and often bullied child leigh grew up to often be uncomfortable in his skin and used his frequently bizarre designs as an armour for his insecurities as he got larger he used his costumes to exaggerate his size and the effect was frequently overpowering and unforgettable for those who encountered him the more so because of his confrontational style bowery was not a wallflower in the early days bowery felt comfortable with describing himself as gay although he had intense and passionate friendships occasionally of a sexual nature with women often in the form of a sadomasochistic type relationship with bowery firmly in the role of master puppeteer with his bizarre looks leigh often had difficulties attracting the men he was sexually attracted to and he would often describe having sex in risky underground situations such as cottaging with unattractive individuals unlike many of his club contemporaries bowery was highly intelligent widely read and passionate about all forms of artistic expression while he could be extremely witty and charming he would often be a malicious fashion bully intimidating friend and foe alike with his sharp tongue and accusations these all reflected a sign of the times where hardness went hand in hand with the club scene although taboo was over by early 1987 bowery was at the very heart of london s alternative fashion movement but aids and hard drugs had influenced the scene causing the death of his best friend and former lover trojan then of taboo door whore and budding musician marc valtier as a result bowery experienced severe depression which manifested itself in abusive unsafe sexual activities often in cottaging and public cruising grounds it was probably at this time he contracted hiv although he kept this a closely guarded secret from most friends until days before his death being hiv positive at this time was seen as a death sentence and there was much fear and discrimination to be faced bowery did not want to be described as an artist with aids feeling it would overshadow any of his artistic achievements soon after he collaborated with the famous 1980s dancer michael clark after having been first his costume designer before eventually joining the company as a dancer he also participated in multi media events like i am kurious oranj and the play hey luciani with mark e smith and the band the fall in 1988 he had a week long show in anthony d offay s prestigious dering street gallery in london s west end in which he lolled on a chaise longue behind a two way mirror primping and preening in a variety of outfits while visitors to the gallery looked on the insouciance and audacity of this overt queer narcissism captivated gallery goers critics and other artists bowery s exquisite appearance silence and intense self absorption were further accentuated by his own recordings of random and abrasive traffic noises which were played for the show s duration the very intimate and private was flung in the face of the public complete with a street life sound track hinting perhaps at something still darker in some outfits he appears like some strange roadside creature like a cat that finally got the cream in others he is the satan s son that he would whisper years later on his deathbed for all his art world exposure and contacts it seems peculiar now that no one suggested to bowery that he might adopt the very viable strategy of gilbert and george an earlier generation s living sculpture and derive an income from selling images of himself rather than rely on occasional commissions modeling work for lucian freud or design consultancy for rifat ozbek in the later years of his life the advantages of having an independent income started to become more obvious and bowery looked to music in the form of art rock pop group minty to possibly provide this independent income stream i have a profile he confided to former flatmate and fellow australian anne holt but i have no money minty he hoped would provide a solution to this crux although this wish eventually proved to be unfounded he later excited the fashion crowd with a performance at smact a short lived sm night at bar industria using nazi costumes with a lesbian friend named barbara they turned concentration camp experimentation into smart the readers of capital gay the london weekly newspaper turned on fellow performer berkley who had played the victim and barbara and bowery weathered the storm in 1993 bowery briefly formed the band raw sewage with leading clubbers sheila tequila and stella stein they performed nude with their faces blacked up wearing 18 platforms and merkins to the bemusement of audiences in london clubs and at the love ball in amsterdam but the collaboration ended in personality clashes bowery went on to appear as the madame garbo in the homosexual by copi at bagleys warehouse in london s king s cross in 1993 bowery formed the band minty with friend and former 1980s knitwear designer richard torry nicola bateman and matthew glammore their single useless man boot licking tit tweaking useless man  which was remixed by the grid along with their twisted onstage scatological performances caused the sun to describe them as the sickest band in the world of which bowery was very proud the single became a minor chart hit in the netherlands although friends felt that he had lost his true artistic self to cheap and obvious shock horror tactics none of which were new during 1994 leigh performed the fete worse than death in hoxton square bowery and nicola bateman presented their classic birth show a homage to john waters female trouble in which bowery gave birth to bateman who was held under his costume and upside down using a specially designed harness bowery would appear to enter the stage alone but toward the middle of the song birthed his partner who appeared as a very large baby covered in placenta the performance was revised for lady bunny s wigstock event and captured in wigstock the movie in november 1994 minty began a two week show at london s freedom cafe including audience member alexander mcqueen but it was too much for westminster city council who closed the show down after only one night minty was a financial loss and represented a low point in his colourful career a spin off band called offest later formed including artist donald urquhart glimmers of the influences of film maker john waters and artist andy warhol can be seen in his keen appreciation of bad taste truly outlandish self presentation and a deep desire to shock and confuse i want to be the andy warhol of london he once said dressed up he was obviously modern art on legs but in daytime attire the badly fitting obvious disturbing wigs are a nod to warhol s self presentation strategies that has thus far seemed invisible to both critics and friends alike other art historical parallels include an early 80s attempt at vincent van gogh type ear cutting with friend trojan and as a result inflicted facial perforations that he was warned would not heal bowery made a full auto couture appearance at the 1986 warhol show success is a job in new york at london s serpentine gallery with nicola and an unknown assistant he became known to a wider audience by appearing in a post modernist surrealist series of television and cinema and commercials for the pepe jeans company mtv london and other commissions such as stage work for rock band u2 he also appeared regularly in articles vox pops and as cover star in london s i d magazine bowery was also art director for the famous video for massive attack s unfinished sympathy bowery was the nude subject of several of lucian freud s better later portraits and travelled internationally to the opening events of his exhibitions this modeling work provided him with a modest income of sorts for a period and he certainly relished freud s connections to the british establishment though it seems strange now that such an explosively original and inventive artist like bowery would subordinate himself to the likes of freud anarchistic till the end bowery even squirreled away a couple of freud s small paintings as a character he featured in the stage musical taboo that was based on the new romantic movement it also featured actors playing marilyn boy george steve strange and other stars of the early 1980s the musical which was written by mark davies with music composed partly by boy george was a london west end hit american media star rosie o donnell financed a much altered version for broadway but this was not successful although bowery always described himself as gay he married his long term friend nicola bateman on may 13 1994 in tower hamlets london 7 months before his death from aids related illness at the middlesex hospital westminster london on new year s eve 1994 after a five week battle that only a handful of friends were informed about reportedly one death bed pronouncement tell them i ve gone pig farming in bolivia illustrates the gallows humour and dark irony that can be traced in much of his work among his last requests was that his middle name be unknown the character vulva who was played by david walliams in the british tv comedy series spaced is based on leigh bowery boy george did record a tribute song on his 1995 album cheapness and beauty the track is called satan s butterfly ball in boy george s taboo musical the leigh bowery character sings tracks like ich bin kunst and i ll have you all fashion collections models models for these shows included old friends such as trojan david walls peter hammond marc vaultier george gallagher james payne david lachapelle jim mcguire robert mcguire sandra cosijn dezi campbell and malcolm duffy

in early 1980 s by hollywood rose members axl rose and izzy stradlin and l a guns members tracii guns ole beich and rob gardner the band created its name by combining two of the group members names a short time later before guns n roses even played any gigs guitarist tracii guns quit to reform l a guns slash replaced guns and duff mckagan replaced ole beich slash had played for rose and stradlin during a short stint in hollywood rose the new line up came together quickly but after deciding to go on a tour from sacramento california to duff s home town of seattle drummer rob gardner quit and was replaced by slash s close friend steven adler the band which continued to be called guns n roses even after the departure of tracii guns established its first stable line up on this so called hell tour in an interview slash stated that is really what cemented the band and established its chemistry after witnessing a guns n roses show at the troubadour tom zutaut a geffen records a r executive falsely warned other scouts they suck so he could have more time and leeway to try to sign them axl rose demanded and received a 75 000 advance from zutaut before revealing that he had promised an a r executive from chrysalis that the band would sign with her if she walked naked down the sunset strip for five days zutaut nervously watched from his office window for a naked a r executive before he could close the deal alan niven was subsequently hired as the band s manager and the team set out to record the band s full length debut album geffen records released an ep in late 1986 to keep the interest in the band alive while the band withdrew from the club scene to work in the studio the four song ep live like a suicide came out on the ostensibly independent uzi suicide records label only 10 000 vinyl copies of the ep were produced on halloween night 1986 guns n roses performed at ucla s ackerman ballroom as the opening act to thelonious monster the dickies and the headlining red hot chili peppers the record was billed as a live recording although rose would reveal years later that it was simulated the ep consisted of four songs from the band s demo tapes with crowd noise overdubbed it contained covers of rose tattoo s nice boys and aerosmith s mama kin along with two original compositions the punk anthem reckless life and the classic rock inspired move to the city both of which were co written by hollywood rose s founding member chris weber the original vinyl live   like a suicide ep has become a valuable and sought after collector s item even though the tracks were re issued two years later on the gn r lies album the band s first album appetite for destruction was released on july 21 1987 in the us welcome to the jungle was issued as its first single with an accompanying music video initially the album and single lingered for almost a year without performing well but when geffen records founder david geffen was asked to lend support to the band he obliged by personally convincing mtv executives to play welcome to the jungle during their after hours rotation even though the video was initially only played one time at 4 a m on a sunday rock and punk fans took notice and soon began requesting the video and song en masse overseas countries were often treated to material that never saw release to the us market and went unexposed to us fans the original uk welcome to the jungle single was backed with a marquee club performance of ac dc s whole lotta rosie and a 12 inch single included live renditions of it s so easy and the bob dylan classic knockin on heaven s door in japan an entire ep entitled live from the jungle was issued containing the album version of sweet child o mine along with a selection of numerous marquee club recordings the album underwent an artwork change after the original robert williams cover design spawned complaints from religious groups and caused some record stores to brown bag obscure or refuse to sell the album the revised cover was a design by slash it was a picture of two six shooter revolvers with roses wrapped around the butts of the guns rose later insisted that the gold and platinum plaques issued by the riaa be set using the original cover the artwork from the original cover can be found in the booklet of the cd release sweet child o mine was the album s second us single co written by axl rose as a poem for his girlfriend and future wife erin everly due to the growing grassroots success of the band and the cross gender appeal of the tune the song and its accompanying music video received heavy airplay on both radio and mtv and became a smash hit during the summer of 1988 slash stated on vh1 s 100 greatest songs of the 80 s it was actually my least favorite song we ever wrote i hate it but it turns out to be our greatest song ever welcome to the jungle was then re issued as a single with new pressings of records and tapes and new artwork the uk re release was backed with an acoustic version of you re crazy recorded much earlier than the one featured on the g n r lies ep by the time paradise city and its video reached the airwaves the band s touring success and fame had catapulted the album to 1 on the billboard charts welcome to the jungle sweet child o mine and paradise city were all top ten singles in the u s to date appetite for destruction has sold over 28 million copies guns n roses began opening shows for major acts but as their fame began to take hold a world tour in support of appetite for destruction was scheduled the band traveled across the united states and in spring 1988 were invited to the notorious monsters of rock festival at castle donington in leicestershire england where they shared the bill with groups like kiss and iron maiden at the start of the guns n roses set the capacity crowd of over 100 000 began jumping and surging forward despite rose s requests that the crowd move away from the stage two fans were trampled to death the media largely blamed the band for the tragedy and reported that the band had continued playing even when there were dangerous crowd conditions in fact the final report on the donington incident filed by the head of security at the venue noted that the band had not been aware of the extent of fan injuries had immediately halted their set when requested to do so and had attempted to calm the crowd nonetheless events such as these during the appetite for destruction tour earned the group the title of the world s most dangerous band in addition the behavior of the band members also garnered negative attention from the media duff slash izzy and adler were often seen intoxicated both on and off stage the band s next release was g n r lies in 1988 which reached 2 in the billboard music charts the album included the four live like a suicide recordings on one side and four acoustic songs on the other the song one in a million which included the words niggers and faggots among other such obscenities led to controversy in which critics accused the band and specifically axl rose of racism and homophobia rose responded by saying the claims were unfounded particularly considering slash himself is half black he went on to explain that the words were those of a protagonist and not a personal statement and that the lyrics reflected racial and prejudicial problems within society rather than promoting them rose also cited that he idolized gay bisexual singers like freddie mercury and elton john the band had played gigs alongside the all black metal band body count and lead singer ice t wrote in his book the ice opinion that axl had been a victim of the press the same way i am even after the release of gn r lies appetite for destruction continued to be popular for the rest of 1988 and 1989 which resulted in them winning both favorite heavy metal artist and favorite heavy metal album at the nationally televised 1990 american music awards where slash and mckagan appeared visibly intoxicated and used profanities on the air the members finally took steps to deal with their addictions after rose threatened to end the band if they continued with their heavy drug abuse he even spoke publicly about the situation specifically the heroin addictions while opening for the rolling stones at the los angeles memorial coliseum in 1989 in 1990 guns n roses returned to the studio to begin recording their most rambunctious undertaking yet during the recording session of civil war drummer steven adler was unable to perform well due to his struggles with cocaine and heroin addiction his difficulties in the studio caused the band to do nearly 30 takes as a result adler was fired in july 1990 and was replaced by former cult drummer matt sorum a few months prior keyboardist dizzy reed became the sixth member of the group when he joined as a full time member the band fired their manager alan niven in may 1991 replacing him with doug goldstein according to a 1991 cover story by rolling stone magazine rose forced the dismissal of niven by refusing to complete the albums until he was replaced with enough music for two albums the band released use your illusion i and use your illusion ii on september 17 1991 the tactic paid off when the albums debuted at 2 and 1 respectively in the billboard charts setting a record as they became the first and only group to date to achieve this feat the albums spent 108 weeks in the chart guns n roses accompanied the use your illusion albums with many videos including don t cry november rain and estranged some of the most expensive music videos ever made the hit ballad november rain became the most requested video on mtv eventually winning the 1992 mtv video music award for best cinematography during the awards show the band performed the song with elton john accompanying on piano both prior to and after the release of the albums guns n roses embarked on the 28 month long use your illusion world tour it became famous for both its financial success and the many controversial incidents that occurred at the shows the use your illusion world tour included a slash guitar solo incorporating the godfather theme a piano driven axl rose cover of it s alright by black sabbath and an extended jam on the classic rock inspired move to the city where rose showcased the ensemble of musicians assembled for the tour many of the successful performances during the tour were equally matched and often overshadowed in the press by riots late starts and outspoken rants by rose while the band s previous drug and alcohol issues were seemingly under control axl was often agitated by lax security sound problems and unwanted filming or recording of the performances he also used the time in between songs to fire off political statements or retorts against music critics or celebrity rivals on july 2 1991 at the riverport amphitheater in maryland heights missouri just outside of st louis during a performance of rocket queen rose jumped into the audience and tackled a fan who was taking still pictures of the show with a camera after being pulled out of the audience by members of the crew rose said well thanks to the lame ass security i m going home slammed his microphone on the ground and left the stage the sound the microphone made caused some fans to think he shot someone so slash quickly told the audience he just slammed his mic on the floor we re outta here the angry crowd began to riot and dozens of people were injured the footage was captured by robert john who was documenting the entire tour for the band rose was charged with having incited the riot but police were unable to arrest him until almost a year later as the band went overseas to continue the tour charges were filed against rose but a judge ruled that he did not directly incite the riot in his defense rose stated that the guns n roses security team had made four separate requests to the venue s security staff to remove the camera all of which were ignored that other members of the band had reported being hit by bottles from the audience and that the venue s security had been lax allowing weapons into the arena and refusing to enforce a drinking limit consequently use your illusion s artwork featured a hidden message amidst the thank you section of the album insert fuck you st louis after a repeat of the st louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in germany rhythm guitarist izzy stradlin abruptly quit the band citing a combination of rose s personal behaviour and his mis management of the band and difficulties being around slash sorum and mckagan due to his new found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions axl rose originally wanted jane s addiction guitarist dave navarro to replace stradlin but stradlin was eventually replaced by los angeles based guitarist gilby clarke whom slash credited at the time for saving the band during many shows throughout the tour rose introduced clarke and had him play wild horses a rolling stones cover in late 1991 rose added a touring ensemble to the band which included a horns section and several background vocalists in 1992 the band appeared at the freddie mercury tribute concert performing a two song set slash later performed tie your mother down with the remaining members of queen while axl rose performed we will rock you and duetted with elton john on bohemian rhapsody when they returned to the u s for the second leg of the use your illusion tour queen guitarist brian may opened the shows with a band that included cozy powell on drums later in the year they went on the mini gnr metallica stadium tour with american metal band metallica during a show in august 1992 at montreal s olympic stadium metallica frontman james hetfield suffered severe burns after stepping too close to a pyrotechnics blast metallica was forced to cancel the second hour of the show but promised to return to the city for another show after a long delay during which the audience became increasingly restless guns n roses took the stage however the shortened time between sets did not allow for adequate tuning of stage monitors resulting in musicians not being able to hear themselves in addition rose claimed that his throat hurt causing the band to leave the stage early the cancellation led to another riot by audience members reminiscent of the rioting that had occurred in st louis one year earlier rioters overturned cars smashed windows looted local stores and set fires local authorities were barely able to bring the mob under control this can be seen on video in a year and a half in the life of metallica on mtv s rockumentary about metallica the band spoke about this tour and how they learned from guns n roses what not to do the historic tour ended in buenos aires argentina on july 17 1993 the tour set attendance records and lasted for 28 months in which 192 shows were played the show in buenos aires marked the last time original members slash and mckagan as well as newcomers clarke and sorum would play a live show with rose on november 23 1993 guns n roses released a collection of punk and glam rock covers entitled the spaghetti incident despite protests from rose s bandmates an unadvertised cover of the charles manson song look at your game girl was included on the album at his request years later rose said he would remove the song from new pressings of the album claiming that critics and the media had misinterpreted his interest in manson however as of 2009 the song is still on the album the spaghetti incident did not match the success of the illusion albums and tension increased within the band interviews with guns n roses band members suggest that between 1994 and 1996 the band sporadically began to write and record new material most of which according to slash had been written by axl at the time the band had intended to release a single album with 10 or 12 songs regarding the dysfunction of the band s recording at that time axl is quoted as saying we still needed the collaboration of the band as a whole to write the best songs since none of that happened that s the reason why that material got scrapped slash and duff mckagan later left the group and as such all of the original members had departed from the band however an actual break up of guns n roses never occurred as new players were brought in as the old ones left mckagan was the last of rose s original bandmates to leave in 1997 he was replaced by tommy stinson by the end of 1998 a new version of guns n roses had emerged many musicians have come and gone from the new band but the core group has included rose stinson keyboardist dizzy reed multi instrumentalist chris pitman and guitarist robin finck in 1999 the band released one new song oh my god which was included on the soundtrack of the film end of days the track featured additional guitar work by dave navarro and gary sunshine rose s personal guitar teacher the song s release was intended to be a prelude to their new album now officially entitled chinese democracy geffen also released live era 87 93 a collection of live performances from various concerts during the appetite for destruction and use your illusion tours also in 1999 during an interview with kurt loder for mtv axl said that he had re recorded appetite for destruction with the then new band apart from two songs which he had replaced with patience and you could be mine chinese democracy had reportedly been in the works since 1994 with rose the only original member still in the band according to a report published in 2005 by the new york times rose had allegedly burned through 13 million in the studio by that point in 1999

that chinese democracy will be the first of four new albums in recent years there have been persistent rumors that the original lineup of guns n roses would reunite however on february 6 2009 axl rose effectively put to rest any rumors of the original lineup reuniting in an interview with billboard s jonathan cohen i could see doing a song or so on the side with izzy or having him out again i m not so comfortable with doing anything having more than one of the alumni maybe something with duff but that s it and not something i d have to really get down into as i d get left with sorting it out and then blamed on top of it so no not me  rose would go on state in the same interview that there is absolutely no chance of him ever reuniting with slash former lead guitarist of guns n roses what s clear is that one of the two of us will die before a reunion and however sad ugly or unfortunate anyone views it it is how it is those decisions were made a long time ago and reiterated year after

our promoters are really excited with the offers coming in both here and worldwide in march 2009 dj ashba was announced to replace finck for an upcoming tour the music of guns n roses is a fusion of punk rock blues rock heavy metal and classic rock and roll in the 1990s the band integrated keyed instruments into the band and for roughly half of the use your illusion tour added a horn section to

heavy influence on both the image and sound of the band was finnish band hanoi rocks rose has stated that the band was massively inspired by bands like queen ac dc the rolling stones and rose tattoo

of criticism by the media the flagrant alcohol and drug abuse by some members of the group and axl s fondness of charles manson t shirts were used by the media to portray guns n roses as a poor example and negative influence on their young fans the long periods of time that the band took to release albums were also a source of heavy criticism frontman axl rose has become a source of both controversy and criticism since the other founding members left the group his constant elusiveness such as the fact that he has not held a press conference since 1994 has led to several stories claiming he is suffering from bipolar disorder music critics have blamed rose for the break up of the original group have criticized him for continuing the band after the original members had departed and have questioned the constant change in band members they also cite his neurotic behavior and sense of perfectionism as a cause of personal conflict and the long delays between albums 
giacomo antonio domenico michele secondo maria puccini was an italian composer whose operas including la bohème tosca madama butterfly and turandot are among the most frequently performed in the standard repertoire some of his arias such as o mio babbino caro from gianni schicchi che gelida manina from la bohème and nessun dorma from turandot have become part of popular culture puccini was born in lucca in tuscany into a family with five generations of musical history behind them including composer domenico puccini his father died when giacomo was five years old and he was sent to study with his uncle fortunato magi who considered him to be a poor and undisciplined student later puccini took the position of church organist and choir master in lucca but it was not until he saw a performance of verdi s aida that he became inspired to be an opera composer he and his brother michele walked 18 5 mi to see the performance in pisa in 1880 with the help of a relative and a grant puccini enrolled in the milan conservatory to study composition with amilcare ponchielli and antonio bazzini in the same year at the age of 21 he composed the messa which marks the culmination of his family s long association with church music in his native lucca although puccini himself correctly titled the work a messa referring to a setting of the full catholic mass today the work is popularly known as his messa di gloria a name that technically refers to a setting of only the first two prayers of the mass the kyrie and the gloria while omitting the credo the sanctus and the agnus dei the work anticipates puccini s career as an operatic composer by offering glimpses of the dramatic power that he would soon unleash on the stage the powerful arias for tenor and bass soloists are certainly more operatic than is usual in church music and in its orchestration and dramatic power the messa compares interestingly with verdi s requiem while studying at the conservatory puccini obtained a libretto from ferdinando fontana and entered a competition for a one act opera in 1882 although he did not win le villi was later staged in 1884 at the teatro dal verme and it caught the attention of giulio ricordi head of g ricordi co music publishers who commissioned a second opera edgar in 1889 from 1891 onwards puccini spent most of his time at torre del lago a small community about fifteen miles from lucca situated between the tyrrhenian sea and lake massaciuccoli just south of viareggio while renting a house there he spent time hunting but regularly visited lucca by 1900 he had acquired land and built a villa on the lake now known as the villa museo puccini he lived there until 1921 when pollution produced by peat works on the lake forced him to move to viareggio a few kilometres north after his death a mausoleum was created in the villa puccini and the composer is buried there in the chapel along with his wife and son who died later the villa museo puccini is presently owned by his granddaughter simonetta puccini and is open to the public manon lescaut his third opera was his first great success it launched his remarkable relationship with the librettists luigi illica and giuseppe giacosa who collaborated with him on his next three operas which became his three most famous and most performed operas these were after 1904 compositions were less frequent following his passion for driving fast cars puccini was nearly killed in a major accident in 1903 in 1906 giacosa died and in 1909 there was scandal after puccini s wife elvira falsely accused their maid doria manfredi of having an affair with puccini the maid then committed suicide elvira was successfully sued by the manfredis and giacomo had to pay damages finally in 1912 the death of giulio ricordi puccini s editor and publisher ended a productive period of his career however puccini completed la fanciulla del west in 1910 and finished the score of la rondine in 1917 in 1918 il trittico premiered in new york this work is composed of three one act operas a horrific episode in the style of the parisian grand guignol a sentimental tragedy and a comedy of the three gianni schicchi has remained the most popular containing the popular o mio babbino caro a habitual toscano cigar chain smoker puccini began to complain of chronic sore throats towards the end of 1923 a diagnosis of throat cancer led his doctors to recommend a new and experimental radiation therapy treatment which was being offered in brussels puccini and his wife never knew how serious the cancer was as the news was only revealed to his son puccini died there on november 29 1924 from complications from the treatment uncontrolled bleeding led to a heart attack the day after surgery news of his death reached new york during a performance of la bohème the opera was immediately stopped and the orchestra played chopin s funeral march for the stunned audience he was buried in milan but in 1926 his son arranged for the transfer of his father s remains to a specially created chapel inside the puccini villa at torre del lago turandot his final opera was left unfinished and the last two scenes were completed by franco alfano based on the composer s sketches some dispute whether alfano followed the sketches or not since the sketches were said to be indecipherable but he is believed to have done so since together with the autographs he was given transcriptions from guido zuccoli who was accustomed to interpreting puccini s handiwork when arturo toscanini conducted the premiere performance in april 1926 he chose not to perform alfano s portion of the score the performance reached the point where puccini had completed the score at which time toscanini stopped the orchestra the conductor turned to the audience and said here the opera finishes because at this point the maestro died toscanini edited alfano s suggested completion to produce a version now known as alfano ii and this is the version usually used in performance however some musicians consider alfano i to be a more dramatically complete version in 2002 an official new ending was composed by luciano berio from original sketches but this finale has to date been performed only infrequently unlike wagner and verdi puccini did not appear to be active in the politics of his day however mussolini fascist dictator of italy at the time claimed that puccini applied for admission to the national fascist party while it has been proven that puccini was indeed among the early supporters of the fascist party at the time of the election campaign of 1919 there appear to be no records or proof of any application given to the party by puccini in addition it can be noted that had puccini done so his close friend toscanini would probably have severed all friendly connection with him and ceased conducting his operas this notwithstanding fascist propaganda appropriated puccini s figure and one of the most widely played marches during fascist street parades and public ceremonies was the inno a roma composed in 1919 by puccini to lyrics by fausto salvatori based on these verses from horace s carmen saeculare alme sol curru nitido diem qui promis et celas alius que et idem nasceris possis nihil urbe roma visere maius the subject of puccini s style is one that has been long avoided by musicologists this avoidance can perhaps be attributed to the perception that his work with its emphasis on melody and evident popular appeal lacked seriousness despite the place puccini clearly occupies in the popular tradition of verdi his style of orchestration also shows the strong influence of wagner matching specific orchestral configurations and timbres to different dramatic moments his operas contain an unparalleled manipulation of orchestral colors with the orchestra often creating the scene s atmosphere 
the structures of puccini s works are also noteworthy while it is to an extent possible to divide his operas into arias or numbers his scores generally present a very strong sense of continuous flow and connectivity perhaps another sign of wagner s influence like wagner puccini used leitmotifs to connote characters this is apparent in tosca where the three chords which signal the beginning of the opera are used throughout to announce scarpia several motifs are also linked to mimi and the bohemians in la bohème and to cio cio san s eventual suicide in butterfly unlike wagner though puccini s motifs are static where wagner s motifs develop into more complicated figures as the characters develop puccini s remain more or less identical throughout the opera another distinctive quality in puccini s works is the use of the voice in the style of speech characters sing short phrases one after another as if they were talking to each other puccini is celebrated on the other hand for his melodic gift and many of his melodies are both memorable and enduringly popular these melodies are often made of sequences from the scale a very distinctive example being quando me n vo from la bohème and e lucevan le stelle from act iii of tosca today it is rare not to find at least one puccini aria included in an operatic singer s cd album or recital unusual for operas written by italian composers up until that time many of puccini s operas are set outside italy in exotic places such as japan gold mining country in california paris and the riviera and china pulitzer prize winning music critic lloyd schwartz summarized puccini thus is it possible for a work of art to seem both completely sincere in its intentions and at the same time counterfeit and manipulative puccini built a major career on these contradictions but people care about him even admire him because he did it both so shamelessly and so skillfully how can you complain about a composer whose music is so relentlessly memorable even maybe especially at its most saccharine although puccini is mainly known for his operas he also wrote some orchestral pieces sacred music chamber music and songs for voice and piano founded in 1996 in lucca the centro studi giacomo puccini embraces a wide range of approaches to the study of puccini s work in the usa the american center for puccini studies specializes in the presentation of unusual performing editions of composer s works and introduces many neglected or unknown puccini pieces to the music loving public it was founded in 2004 by a leading puccini artist and scholar dr harry dunstan detailed information about both organizations exists on their websites

instrument created by laurie anderson in 1977 it uses recorded magnetic tape in place of the traditional horsehair in the bow and a magnetic tape head in the bridge anderson has updated and modified this device over the years she can be seen using a later generation of this device in her film home of the brave during the late show segment in which she manipulates a sentence recorded by william s burroughs this version of the violin discarded magnetic tape and actually used midi based audio samples triggered by contact with the bow the talking stick is a 6 foot long batonlike midi controller it was used in the moby dick tour in 1999 2000 she described it in program notes as follows the talking stick is a new instrument that i designed in collaboration with a team from interval research and bob bielecki it is a wireless instrument that can access and replicate any sound it works on the principle of granular synthesis this is the technique of breaking sound into tiny segments called grains and then playing them back in different ways the computer rearranges the sound fragments into continuous strings or random clusters that are played back in overlapping sequences to create new textures the grains are very short a few hundredths of a second granular synthesis can sound smooth or choppy depending on the size of the grain and the rate at which they re played the grains are like film frames if you slow them down enough you begin to hear them separately 
jeskola buzz is a proprietary modular software music studio environment centered around a modular plugin based machine view and a multiple pattern sequencer tracker buzz consists of a plugin architecture that allows the audio to be routed from one plugin to another in many ways similar to how cables carry an audio signal between physical pieces of hardware all aspects of signal synthesis and manipulation are handled entirely by the plugin system signal synthesis is performed by generators such as synthesizers noise generator functions samplers and trackers the signal can then be manipulated further by effects such as distortions filters delays and mastering plugins buzz also provides support through adapters to use vst vsti directx dxi and directx media objects as generators and effects a few new classes of plugins do not fall under the normal generator and effect types these include peer machines recorders wavetable editors scripting engines etc buzz signal output also uses a plugin system the most practical drivers include asio directsound and mme buzz supports midi both internally and through several enhancements some midi features are limited or hacked together such as midi clock sync the program has created a large community of musicians and hundreds of machines made by several plugin developers some of these developers have gone on to create directx and vst plugins other developers who have released commercial directx and vst plugins have released buzz versions of their plugins some developers have been inspired by the application to create buzz clones buzz was created by oskari tammelin of the pc demogroup jeskola hence the name oskari has recently restarted development on buzz with builds being released regularly from june till recent the development of the core program buzz exe was halted on october 5 2000 when the developer lost the source code to the program it was announced in june 2008 that development would begin again and the several subsequent releases have regained much of the functionality of the last 2000 software release and have included some modernised features and graphics during the period when the source was considered lost and development on the core of buzz was stalled many new and unique ideas were developed using the existing plugin interface and binary hacks buzz was originally known as the first 3rd generation tracker in 1997 98 since then through the help of programmers and addons like cyanphase overloader buzz has moved well beyond this stereotype and become a unique and powerful piece of audio software often drawing comparisons to features found in similar applications like max msp pure data reaktor bidule and usine many applications have been derived from or inspired by the concepts interfaces and formats of buzz these have been collectively termed buzz clones or mid level modular programs by the buzz community depending how closely the application resembles the original buzz applications under this umbrella may also be considered buzz clones because the developers making them have close ties to the buzz scene there is debate in various buzz forums as to how far an application can diverge from buzz and still be considered a buzz clone since some applications attempt full compatibility with the original plugin system and document model whereas others borrow the concept of mid level modules without retaining compatibility with buzz plugins or documents buzé is a good example of a buzz clone that maintains a high degree of compatibility with both the existing file format and user interface some buzz clones are also being developed to experiment with the idea of abstracting the user interface into the plugin system other projects are aiming to bring buzz like functionality on other platforms such as linux for instance buzztard is an effort to recreate a buzz like environment under a free software license which runs under linux there is a listing of many buzz clones with subjective ratings to give hints of their diversity at the buzzclones entry of the buzz centric wiki buzzwiki a similar list can also be found under related software packages on buzztard s webpage buzz s plugin system is intended to be a freeware only plugin format this desire has been respected by the community except for a certain time for jeskola xs 1 almost all plugins released to the buzz scene can be found at buzzmachines com a centralized webpage that provides a way for the entire community to access new plugins the header files used to compile new plugins contain a small notice that they are only to be used for making freeware plugins and buzz file music players in the case of entire software suites buzz clones or sequencers that want to use the buzz plugin system the author asks for a fee in 2001 image line software paid to add buzz support to their commercial program fl studio this created a controversy within the community because the commercial aspect of the application did not sit well with several freeware plugin developers a truce was reached when image line software gave time for the developers to opt out of the deal jeskola buzz has proven popular within a range of genres notably glitch idm click house and other modern electronic genres famous users of the tracker include 
symphony x is an american progressive metal band founded in new jersey in 1994 by guitarist michael romeo their 1997 album the divine wings of tragedy and their 2000 release v the new mythology suite have given the band considerable attention within the progressive metal community musically symphony x is often compared to other progressive metal bands such as dream theater and fates warning they play in complex timings and odd meters while incorporating elements of symphonic metal and more traditional heavy metal into their sound their music also contains strong neo classical elements reminiscent of yngwie malmsteen cacophony randy rhoads and other neo classical metal artists in early 1994 michael romeo recorded a demo tape entitled the dark chapter which featured himself and keyboard player michael pinnella the tape attracted a fair share of attention particularly in japan he then recruited bassist thomas miller drummer jason rullo vocalist rod tyler and finally keyboard player michael pinnella their self titled debut album was recorded in the same year and released to a positive reception in japan by the now extinct record company zero corporation label the band s second studio album the damnation game followed six months later singer rod tyler had left the band by then and was replaced by current singer russell allen the divine wings of tragedy was the album that first gave symphony x exposure in metal circles it took a considerable time to record the album with the recording sessions beginning in 1996 and concluding in 1997 the positive feedback from the specialized press served to establish symphony x in europe their success in japan only continued to grow at the end of 1997 and for part of the next year jason rullo their drummer had to stay away from the band in order to solve personal issues he was temporarily replaced by thomas walling even with a temporary drummer the band recorded twilight in olympus released in early 1998 that year also saw the first live performances from the band which by then had already gathered many fans from around the globe their first official show happened in 1998 in japan it was soon followed by a world tour bassist thomas miller left the band and was replaced by michael lepond in that year a compilation album prelude to the millennium was released by the end of 1998 as an extra it featured a second version of the song masquerade from the first album with russell allen on vocals jason rullo returned to the drums for the band s fifth album v the new mythology suite released in 2000 it was the band s first release on major progressive label insideout music the album was their first concept album dealing with the myth of atlantis the album features classics such as communion and the oracle egypt and the mini suite rediscovery and includes pieces of classical music the band went on a european tour shortly after its release and recorded their first live album live on the edge of forever in 2002 the band released the odyssey an album prominently featuring a 24 minute long musical interpretation of the homeric epic the odyssey keyboardist michael pinnella released a solo album entitled enter

were very unlikely when asked by billboard com whether rage planned to head to the studio in 2009 morello stated that we ve had a wonderful year and a half of playing shows and i don t see any reason to not play more shows the thing is there s only so many hours in the musical day and mine are very occupied right now morello elaborated that the nightwatchman is now my principal musical focus as i see it for the remainder of my life from the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses it was apparent to me that this music was as important to me as any music i ve ever been involved in it really encapsulates everything i want to do as an artist integral to their identity as a band rage against the machine voice revolutionary viewpoints highly critical of the domestic and foreign policies of the u s government throughout its existence ratm and its individual members participated in political protests and other activism to advocate these beliefs the band primarily saw its music as a vehicle for social activism de la rocha explained that i m interested in spreading those ideas through art because music has the power to cross borders to break military sieges and to establish real dialogue morello said of wage slavery in america meanwhile detractors pointed out the tension between voicing commitment to leftist causes while being millionaires signed to epic records a subsidiary of media conglomerate sony records infectious grooves released a song called do what i tell ya which mocks lyrics from killing in the name accusing the band of being hypocrites in response to such critiques morello offered the rebuttal at the coachella 2007 performance de la rocha made an impassioned speech during wake up citing a statement by noam chomsky regarding the nuremberg trials

denver at the denver coliseum during the 2008 democratic national convention in protest of the war in iraq after the concert the band joined members of the coup and flobots in an anti war protest march from the denver coliseum to the pepsi center led by iraq veterans against the war the band are vocal supporters of the zapatista army of national liberation especially de la rocha who has taken several trips to the mexican state of chiapas to aid their efforts the flag of the ezln serves as the primary recurring theme in the band s visual art morello described the ezln as a guerrilla army who represent the poor indigenous communities in southern mexico who for hundreds of years have been trodden upon and sort of cast aside and which really are the lowest form on the economic social ladder in mexico in 1994 on new years day there was an uprising there and they were led by the very charismatic subcomandante marcos and it s a group which is tremendously supportive of the most objectively poor and continues to fight for dignity for all people in mexico an interviewer was once told by de la rocha our purpose in sympathising with the zapatistas is to help spark dialogue de la rocha has been particularly outspoken on the cause of the ezln he explained the importance of the cause to him personally the ezln and de la rocha s experiences with them inspired the songs wind below and without a face from evil empire and war within a breath from the battle of los angeles the ezln flag has been used as a stage backdrop at all of the band s shows since their reunion in april 2007 on april 10 1996 the band was scheduled to perform two songs on the nbc comedy variety show saturday night live the show was hosted that night by ex republican presidential candidate and billionaire steve forbes according to tom morello ratm wanted to stand in sharp juxtaposition to a billionaire telling jokes and promoting his flat tax by making our own statement to this end the band hung two upside down american flags from their amplifiers seconds before they took the stage to perform bulls on parade snl and nbc sent stagehands in to pull the flags down the inverted flags says morello represented the band s first attempt to hang the flags during a pre telecast rehearsal on thursday was stopped by snl s producers who demanded that we take the flags down according to morello they said the sponsors would be upset and that because steve forbes was on they had to run a tighter show snl also told the band it would mute objectionable lyrics in bullet in the head and insisted that the song be bleeped in the studio because forbes had friends and family there on the night of the show following the removal of the flags during the first performance the band was approached by snl and nbc officials and ordered to immediately leave the building upon hearing this ratm bassist commerford reportedly stormed forbes dressing room throwing shreds from one of the torn down flags morello noted that members of the saturday night live cast and crew whom he declined to name xpressed solidarity with our actions and a sense of shame that their show had censored the performance radio free los angeles was a radio show held by the band on january 20 1997 the night of bill clinton s inauguration as president the show comprised segments and interviews featuring michael moore emily hodgson leonard peltier chuck d mumia abu jamal unite noam chomsky amy ray of the indigo girls and subcomandante marcos of the zapatistas these were intercut with musical performances by morello de la rocha flea and stephen perkins playing different versions of rage songs and also beck and cypress hill playing their own songs the band organized and played the show in response to the re election of clinton the two hour show was syndicated by over 50 commercial u s radio stations and streamed live from the band s website transcripts of the interviews are freely available online on january 26 2000 filming of the music video for sleep now in the fire which was directed by michael moore caused the doors of the new york stock exchange to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security after band members attempted to gain entry into the exchange footage of enthusiastic wall street employees headbanging to rage s music was used in the final video we decided to shoot this video in the belly of the beast said moore who was arrested during the shooting of the video due to the fact despite having a federal permit for the location they did not have a sound permit ratm played a free concert at the 2000 democratic national convention in protest of the two party system the band had been considering playing a protest concert there since april of that year although they were at first required by the city of los angeles to perform in a small venue at a considerable distance early in august a united states district court judge ruled that the city s request was too restrictive and the city subsequently allowed the protests and concert to be held at a site across from the dnc the police response was to increase security measures which included a 12 ft fence and patrolling by a minimum of 2 000 officers wearing riot gear as well as additional horses motorcycles squad cars and police helicopters a police spokesperson said they were gravely concerned because of security reasons during the concert de la rocha said to the crowd brothers and sisters our democracy has been hijacked and later also shouted we have a right to oppose these motherfuckers after the performance a small group of attendees congregated at the point in the protest area closest to the dnc facing the police officers throwing rocks and possibly engaging in more violent activity such as throwing glass concrete and water bottles filled with noxious agents spraying ammonia on police and slingshotting rocks and steel balls the police soon after declared the gathering an unlawful assembly shut off the electrical supply interrupting performing band ozomatli and informed the protestors that they had 15 minutes to disperse on pain of arrest some of the protestors remained however including two young men who climbed the fence and waved black flags who were subsequently shot in the face with pepper spray police then forcibly dispersed the crowd using tear gas pepper spray and rubber bullets at least six people were arrested in the incident the police faced severe and broad criticism for their reaction with an american civil liberties union spokesperson saying that it was nothing less than an orchestrated police riot several primary witnesses reported unnecessarily violent actions and police abuses including firing on reporters and people obeying police commands police responded that their response was outstanding and clearly disciplined de la rocha said of the incident i don t care what fucking television stations said the violence was caused by the people at the concert those motherfuckers unloaded on this crowd and i think it s ridiculous considering you know none of us had rubber bullets none of us had m16s none of us had billy clubs none of us had face shields footage of the protest and ensuing violence along with an mtv news report on the incident was included in the live at the grand olympic auditorium dvd on september 2 2008 rage against the machine was scheduled to play a free show in protest of what zack called the white and power abusing party in st paul minnesota on the state capital lawn for ripple effect tom morello asked suicidegirls to report what happened at the conventions quoted he said they showed up at exactly the time we were scheduled to perform and as soon as we got out of our vehicle we were immediately surrounded by riot police who told us if we approached the stage we d be arrested for playing music they said that we were not on a permit for the day s show we produced the permit and showed them that none of the artists that had already been playing for the previous four hours including anti flag and michael franti none of the artists were listed on the permits they just tried to use that as an excuse to stop us from playing we were there right on time to play and they physically barred us from getting onto the stage because they were afraid of the music we were going to play imagine if in beijing during the olympics a chinese band whose songs were critical of the government was told they d be arrested if they attempted to sing those songs in a public forum there would have been an international human rights outcry but that s exactly what happened in minnesota but this is a band that has made a living singing a song that goes fuck you i won t do what you tell me so we weren t about to go back to the hotel with our tails between our legs so we out flanked the police line and went into the middle of the crowd and played a couple of songs passing a bull horn back and forth and it seemed to go over pretty well after unsuccessfully arguing with officials about playing they walked into the crowd and sang bulls on parade and killing in the name a cappella with megaphones afterward they led the march towards the convention but left just before the end on september 3 2008 the band played a concert in minneapolis at the target center on the second day of the republican national convention an impromptu demonstration spilled out into the streets afterwards 102 people were arrested as riot police ended the gathering the band are advocates for the release of former black panther and death row inmate mumia abu jamal who was convicted of murdering a police officer and for whom they wrote and recorded the track voice of the voiceless for their 1999 album the battle of los angeles the band performed at a benefit concert with all proceeds donated to the international concerned family and friends of mumia abu jamal and de la rocha spoke before the united nations commission on human rights in support of abu jamal the band also raised funds and awareness for political activist and convicted double murderer leonard peltier and documented his case in the video for freedom at a 1993 lollapalooza appearance in philadelphia the band stood onstage naked for 15 minutes with duct tape on their mouths and the letters pmrc painted on their chests in protest against censorship by the parents music resource center refusing to play they stood in silence with the sound emitted being only audio feedback from morello and commerford s guitars the band later played a free show for disappointed fans tom morello was arrested for civil disobedience in october 1997 during a union protest by garment workers and their supporters against the use of sweatshop labor by guess billboards subsequently appeared in las vegas and new york featuring a photograph of the band with the caption rage against sweatshops we don t wear guess a message from rage against

generation refuse and resist revolution books the rock rap confidential and voices in the wilderness when the band headlined reading festival on august 22 2008 and the pinkpop festival on june 1 2008 they came on stage to the sound of a prison klaxon dressed in orange prison jumpsuits with black sacks over their heads presumably in reference to the conditions of prisoners at guantanamo bay they remained silent onstage for around a minute until being led to their instruments and performing their opening song bombtrack still in the prison outfits zack de la rocha also repeated his trial george bush for war crimes speech during the song wake up but also cited tony blair as a criminal telling the crowd this made me think what are they so afraid of are they afraid really afraid of four musicians from los angeles who speak their minds i don t think so you wanna know what the fuck they re so afraid of they re scared of you they re scared cause they know that if they don t start pulling all those troops out of iraq all those poor soldiers left in the desert to die that you might go and start some shit in the streets that you might stop working that you might get together and organize a strike to stop them from ever invading another country again that s what they re scared of rage against the machine have released four studio albums 
in acoustics and telecommunication a harmonic of a wave is a component frequency of the signal that is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency for example if the fundamental frequency is f the harmonics have frequencies f 2f 3f 4f etc the harmonics have the property that they are all periodic at the fundamental frequency therefore the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency harmonic frequencies are equally spaced by the width of the fundamental frequency and can be found by repeatedly adding that frequency for example if the fundamental frequency is 25 hz the frequencies of the harmonics are 25 hz 50 hz 75 hz 100 hz etc many oscillators including the human voice a bowed violin string or a cepheid variable star are more or less periodic and thus can be decomposed into harmonics most passive oscillators such as a plucked guitar string or a struck drum head or struck bell naturally oscillate at several frequencies known as partials when the oscillator is long and thin such as a guitar string a trumpet or a chime the partials are practically integer multiples of the fundamental frequency hence these devices can mimic the sound of singing and are often incorporated into music partials whose frequencies are not integer multiples of the fundamental are called inharmonic and are sometimes perceived as unpleasant the untrained human ear typically does not perceive harmonics as separate notes instead they are perceived as the timbre of the tone bells have more clearly perceptible partials than most instruments antique singing bowls are well known for their unique quality of producing multiple harmonic partials or multiphonics the tight relation between overtones and harmonics in music often leads to their being used synonymously in a strictly musical context but they are counted differently leading to some possible confusion this chart demonstrates how they are counted in many musical instruments it is possible to play the upper harmonics without the fundamental note being present in a simple case this has the effect of making the note go up in pitch by an octave but in more complex cases many other pitch variations are obtained in some cases it also changes the timbre of the note this is part of the normal method of obtaining higher notes in wind instruments where it is called overblowing the extended technique of playing multiphonics also produces harmonics on string instruments it is possible to produce very pure sounding notes called harmonics or flageolets by string players which have an eerie quality as well as being high in pitch harmonics may be used to check at a unison the tuning of strings that are not tuned to the unison for example lightly fingering the node found half way down the highest string of a cello produces the same pitch as lightly fingering the node 1 3 of the way down the second highest string for the human voice see overtone singing which uses harmonics harmonics may be either used or considered as the basis of just intonation systems composer arnold dreyblatt is able to bring out different harmonics on the single string of his modified double bass by slightly altering his unique bowing technique halfway between hitting and bowing the strings composer lawrence ball uses harmonics to generate music electronically the fundamental frequency is the reciprocal of the period of the periodic phenomenon this article contains material from the federal standard 1037c which as a work of the united states government is in the public domain the following table displays the stop points on a stringed instrument such as the guitar at which gentle touching of a string will force it into a harmonic mode when vibrated 
john birks dizzy gillespie was an american jazz trumpeter bandleader singer and composer he was born in cheraw south carolina the youngest of nine children dizzy s father was a local bandleader so instruments were made available to dizzy he started to play the piano at the age of 4 together with charlie parker he was a major figure in the development of bebop and modern jazz in addition to featuring in these epochal moments in bebop he was instrumental in founding afro cuban jazz the modern jazz version of what early jazz pioneer jelly roll morton referred to as the spanish tinge gillespie was a trumpet virtuoso and gifted improviser building on the virtuoso style of roy eldridge but adding layers of harmonic complexity previously unknown in jazz in addition to his instrumental skills dizzy s beret and horn rimmed spectacles his scat singing his bent horn pouched cheeks and his light hearted personality were essential in popularizing bebop he had an enormous impact on subsequent trumpeters both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians dizzy s first pro job was with the frank fairfax orchestra in 1935 after which he joined the respective orchestras of edgar hayes and subsequently teddy hill essentially replacing his main influence roy eldridge as first trumpet in 1937 in 1939 gillespie joined up with cab calloway s orchestra with which he recorded one of his earliest compositions the instrumental pickin the cabbage in 1940 after dizzy left calloway in late 1941 over a notorious incident with a knife he freelanced with a few bands most notably being ella fitzgerald s orchestra composed of members of the late chick webb s band in 1942 in 1943 gillespie then joined up with the earl hines orchestra the legendary big band of billy eckstine gave his unusual harmonies a better setting and it was as a member of eckstine s band that he was reunited with parker after earlier being members of earl hines s more conventional band with charlie parker gillespie jammed at famous jazz clubs like minton s playhouse and monroe s uptown house where the first seeds of bebop were planted gillespie s compositions like groovin high woody n you salt peanuts and a night in tunisia sounded radically different harmonically and rhythmically than the swing music popular at the time one of their first small group performances together was only issued in 2005 a concert in new york s town hall on june 22 1945 gillespie taught many of the young musicians on 52nd street like miles davis and max roach about the new style of jazz after a lengthy gig at billy berg s club in los angeles which left most of the audience ambivalent or hostile towards the new music the band broke up unlike parker who was content to play in small groups and be an occasional featured soloist in big bands gillespie aimed to lead a big band himself his first attempt to do this came in 1945 but it did not prove a success after his work with parker gillespie led other small combos and finally put together his first successful big band he also appeared frequently as a soloist with norman granz s jazz at the philharmonic he also headlined the 1946 independently produced musical revue film jivin in be bop in 1948 dizzy was involved in a traffic accident when the bicycle he was riding was bumped by an automobile he was slightly injured and found that he could no longer hit the b flat above high c he won the case but the jury only awarded him 1000 in view of his high earnings up to that point on march 11 1952 gillespie left for france after being invited by charles delaunay to play on salon du jazz gillespie did not have any other commitments during his time in paris and on his blue star sessions and started to assemble his third big band due to his prior success he could now record in the finest studios like théatre des champs elysées in 1953 he returned to the united states after a series of successful concerts and recordings and the 1953 line up of the dizzy gillespie stan getz sextet featured gillespie stan getz oscar peterson herb ellis ray brown and max roach as well as his work with getz he also recorded on a couple of occasions with saxophonists sonny rollins and sonny stitt in 1956 he organized a band to go on a state department tour of the middle east and earned the nickname the ambassador of jazz in the late 1940s gillespie was also involved in the movement called afro cuban music bringing latin and african elements to greater prominence in jazz and even pop music particularly salsa gillespie s most famous contributions to afro cuban music are the compositions manteca and tin tin deo he was responsible for commissioning george russell s cubano be cubano bop which featured the great but ill fated cuban conga player chano pozo in 1977 gillespie discovered arturo sandoval while researching music during a tour of cuba unlike his contemporary miles davis gillespie essentially remained true to the bebop style for the rest of his career in 1960 he was inducted into the down beat jazz hall of fame in 1964 the artist put himself forward as a presidential candidate he promised that if he were elected the white house would be renamed the blues house and a cabinet composed of duke ellington miles davis max roach charles mingus ray charles louis armstrong mary lou williams thelonious monk and malcolm x he also said his running mate would be phyllis diller gillespie published his autobiography to be or not to bop in 1979 in the 1980s dizzy gillespie led the united nation orchestra for three years flora purim toured with the orchestra and she credits gillespie with evolving her understanding of jazz after being in the field for over two decades david sánchez also toured with the group and was also greatly affected by gillespie both artists later were nominated for grammy awards gillespie also had a guest appearance on the cosby show as well as sesame street and the muppet show in 1982 dizzy gillespie had a cameo on stevie wonder s hit do i do gillespie s tone gradually faded in the last years in life and his performances often focused more on his proteges such as arturo sandoval and jon faddis his good humoured comedic routines became more and more a part of his live act in 1988 gillespie had worked with canadian flautist and saxophonist moe koffman on their prestigious album oop pop a da he did fast scat vocals on the title track and a couple of the other tracks were played only on trumpet in 1989 gillespie gave 300 performances in 27 countries appeared in 100 u s cities in 31 states and the district of columbia headlined three television specials performed with two symphonies and recorded four albums he was also crowned a traditional chief in nigeria received the commandeur de l ordre des arts et des lettres france s most prestigious cultural award was named regent professor by the university of california and received his fourteenth honorary doctoral degree this one from the berklee college of music in addition he was awarded the grammy lifetime achievement award the same year the next year at the kennedy center for the performing arts ceremonies celebrating the centennial of american jazz gillespie received the kennedy center honors award and the american society of composers authors and publishers duke ellington award for 50 years of achievement as a composer performer and bandleader november 26 1992 at carnegie hall in new york following the second bahá í world congress was dizzy s 75th birthday concert and his offering to the celebration of the centenary of the passing of bahá u lláh gillespie was to appear at carnegie hall for the 33rd time the line up included jon faddis marvin doc holladay james moody paquito d rivera and the mike longo trio with ben brown on bass and mickey roker on drums but gillespie didn t make it because he was in bed suffering from cancer of the pancreas but the musicians played their real hearts out for him no doubt suspecting that he would not play again each musician gave tribute to their friend this great soul and innovator in the world of jazz gillespie also starred in a film called the winter in lisbon released in 2004 he has a star on the hollywood walk of fame at 7057 hollywood boulevard in the hollywood section of the city of los angeles he is honored by the dec 31 2006 a jazz new year s eve freddy cole the dizzy gillespie all star big band at the john f kennedy center for the performing arts he died of pancreatic cancer january 6 1993 aged 75 and was buried in the flushing cemetery queens new york mike longo delivered a eulogy at his funeral he was also with gillespie on the night he died along with jon faddis and a select few others at the time of his death dizzy was survived by his widow lorraine willis gillespie a daughter jazz singer jeanie bryson and a grandson radji birks bryson barrett gillespie had two funerals one was a bahá í funeral at his request at which his closest friends and colleagues attended the second was at the cathedral of st john the divine in new york open to the public dizzy gillespie a bahá í since 1970 was one of the most famous adherents of the bahá í faith which helped him make sense of his position in a succession of trumpeters as well as turning his life from knife carrying roughneck to global citizen and from alcohol to soul force in the words of author nat hentoff who knew gillespie for forty years he is often called the bahá í jazz ambassador he is honored with weekly jazz sessions at the new york bahá í center gillespie s image is almost inseparable from his trademark trumpet whose bell was bent at a 45 degree angle rather than a traditional straight trumpet in honor of this trademark the smithsonian s national museum of american history has collected gillespie s b flat trumpet according to gillespie s autobiography this was originally the result of accidental damage caused during a job on january 6 1953 but the constriction caused by the bending altered the tone of the instrument and gillespie liked the effect gillespie s biographer alyn shipton writes that gillespie likely got the idea when he saw a similar instrument in 1937 in manchester england while on tour with the teddy hill orchestra gillespie came across an english trumpeter who was using such an instrument because his vision was poor and the horn made reading music easier according to this account gillespie was able to try out the horn and the experience led him much later to commission a similar horn for himself whatever the origins of gillespie s upswept trumpet by june 1954 gillespie was using a professionally manufactured horn of this design and it was to become a visual trademark for him for the rest of his life this is an incomplete list of gillespie s recordings 
in music and music theory a chord is a set of three or more different notes from a specific key that sound simultaneously most often in european influenced music chords are tertian sonorities that can be constructed as stacks of thirds relative to some underlying scale two note combinations are typically referred to as dyads or intervals a succession of chords is called a chord progression four ways of notating or representing chords are often used roman numerals figured bass macro symbols and popular music symbols the word chord comes from cord which is a middle english shortening of accord in the middle ages western harmony featured the perfect intervals of a fourth a fifth and an octave in the 15th and 16th centuries the major and minor triads became increasingly common and were soon established as the default sonority for western music four note seventh chords were then widely adopted from the 17th century the harmony of many contemporary popular western genres continues to be founded in the use of triads and seventh chords though far from universally notable exceptions include modern jazz in which chords often include at least five notes with seven being quite common and atonal or post tonal contemporary classical music whose chords can be far more complex rooted in such disparate harmonic philosophies that traditional terms such as triad are rarely useful chords are so well established in western music that sonorities of two pitches or even monophonic melodies are often interpreted by listeners as implying chords this psychoacoustic phenomenon occurs as a result of a lifetime of exposure to the conventional harmonies of music with the result that the brain supplies the complete expected chord in its absence 
composers can and do take advantage of this tendency to surprise the listener by deliberately avoiding certain defining tones for instance a composition may be predominantly composed in the pentatonic minor scale implying common aeolian mode to the listener before deliberately including a more uncommon tone in a melodic progression or chord such as a major vi or a flattened ii every chord has certain characteristics which include one way of classifying chords is according to the number of distinct pitch classes used in their construction a pitch class being identified by a degree of the scale without regard to which octave it occurs in chords using three pitch classes are called triads chords using four notes are known as tetrads those using five are called pentads and those using six are hexads they are sometimes called trichords tetrachords pentachords and hexachords however these terms more usually refer to contiguous pitch classes in some scale usually spanning a perfect fourth and not generally played simultaneously theorists differ as to whether chords consist of at least three pitches otto karolyi p 63 disagrees writing that two or more notes sounded simultaneously are known as a chord the vertical combination of three sounds fundamental note third and fifth gives us a chord known as a triad in contrast andrew surmani writes that when three or more notes are sounded together the combination is called a chord and george t jones explains two tones sounding together are usually termed an interval while three or mores tones are called a chord according to monath a chord is a combination of three or more tones sounded simultaneously for which the distances between the tones are based on a particular formula many chords can be arranged as a series whose elements are separated by intervals that are all roughly the same size for example a c major triad contains the notes c e and g these notes can be arranged in the series c e g in which the first interval is a major third while the second interval is a minor third any chord that can be arranged as a series of thirds is called a tertian chord a chord such as c d e is a series of seconds containing a major second and a minor second such chords are called secundal the chord c f b which consists of a perfect fourth c f and an augmented fourth f b is called quartal most western music uses tertian chords on closer examination however the terms secundal tertian and quartal can become ambiguous the terms second third and fourth are often understood relative to a scale but it is not always clear which scale they refer to for example consider the pentatonic scale g a c d f relative to the pentatonic scale the intervals g c and c f are thirds since there is one note between them relative to the chromatic scale however the intervals g c and c f are fourths since they are five semitones wide for this reason the chord g c f might be described both as tertian and quartal depending on whether one is measuring intervals relative to the pentatonic or chromatic scales the use of accidentals complicates the picture the chord b e a is notated as a series of diminished fourths and however the chord is enharmonically equivalent to c e g which is a series of major thirds and notationally then b e a is a fourth chord even though it sounds identical to the tertian chord c e g in some circumstances it is useful to talk about how a chord is notated while in others it is useful to talk about how it sounds terms such as tertian and quartal can be used in either sense and it is important to be clear about which is intended chords are also distinguished and notated by the scale degree of their root note or bass note for example since the first scale degree of the c major scale is the note c a triad built on top of the note c would be called the one chord which might be notated 1 i or even c in which case the assumption would be made that the key signature of the particular piece of music in question would indicate to the musician what function a c major triad was fulfilling and that any special role of the chord outside of its normal diatonic function would be inferred from the context when taking any major scale and building a triad with a base in the scale the second third and sixth intervals when used as a root will form a minor triad the root fourth and fifth form a major triad whereas the seventh will form a diminished triad when in minor modes building a triad upon the tonic fourth and fifth degrees of the scale will result in a minor chord building upon scale degree two will result in a diminished chord while building a triad upon scale degrees three six and seven will yield major chords roman numerals indicate the root of the chord as a scale degree within a particular major key as follows many analysts use lower case roman numerals to indicate minor triads and upper case for major ones with degree and plus signs to indicate diminished and augmented triads respectively when they are not used all the numerals are capital and the qualities of the chords are inferred from the other scale degrees that chord contains for example a chord built on vi in c major would contain the notes a c and e and would therefore be a minor triad chords that are not on the scale can be indicated by placing a flat sharp sign before the chord for example the chord of e flat major in the key of c major is represented by iii the scale to whose scale degrees the roman numerals refer may be indicated to the left but may also be understood from the key signature or other contextual clues unlike pop chord symbols which are used as a guide to players roman numerals are used primarily as analytical tools and so indications of inversions or added tones are sometimes omitted if they are not relevant to the analysis being performed when the bass is not the same as the root the chord is inverted the number of inversions that a chord can have is one fewer than the number of constituent notes triads for example can have three positions two of which are inversions tertian triads can be described as a series of three notes the first element is called the root note of the chord the second note is called the third of the chord and the last note is called the fifth of the chord these are described below as an example consider an octave of the c major scale consisting of the notes c d e f g a b c the major triad formed using the c note as the root would consist of c e and g this triad is major because the interval from c to e is a major third using the same scale a minor chord may be constructed using the d as the root note this would be d f a examination at the piano keyboard will reveal that there are four semitones between the root and third of the chord on c but only 3 semitones between the root and third of the chord on d thus the c triad is major while the d triad is minor a triad can be constructed on any note of the c major scale these will all be either minor or major with the exception of the triad on b the leading tone which is diminished for more detail see the article on the mathematics of the western music scale seventh chords may be thought of as the next natural step in composing tertian chords after triads seventh chords are constructed by adding a fourth note to a triad at the interval of a third above the fifth of the chord this creates the interval of a seventh above the root of the chord there are various types of seventh chords depending on the quality of the original chord and the quality of the seventh added five common types of seventh chords have standard symbols the chord quality indications are sometimes superscripted and sometimes not the last three chords are not used commonly except in jazz when a dominant seventh chord is borrowed from another key the roman numeral corresponding with that key is shown after a slash for example v v indicates the dominant of the dominant in the key of c major where the dominant chord is g major this secondary dominant is the chord on the fifth degree of the g major scale i e d major note that while the chord built on d in the key of c major would normally be a minor chord the v v chord also built on d is major extended chords are tertian chords or triads with notes extended or added beyond the seventh thus ninth eleventh and thirteenth chords are extended chords after the thirteenth any notes added in thirds duplicate notes elsewhere in the chord so there are no fifteenth chords seventeenth chords and so on in tonal music theory though such chords may be constructed with up to all twelve unique tones and doublings such a chord may be of arbitrarily large size though large names such as 23rd chord and 25th chord are not particularly useful other extended chords follow the logic of the rules shown above thus maj9 maj11 and maj13 chords are the extended chords shown above with major sevenths rather than minor sevenths similarly m9 m11 and m13 have minor thirds and minor sevenths although the third and seventh of the chord are always determined by the symbols shown above the fifth as well as the extended intervals 9 11 and 13 may be altered through the use of accidentals these are indicated along with the corresponding number of the element to be altered accidentals are most often used in conjunction with dominant seventh chords for example altered dominant seventh chords have a flat ninth a sharp ninth a diminished fifth and an augmented fifth some write this as c7 9 which assumes also the flat ninth diminished fifth and augmented fifth the augmented ninth is often referred to as a blue note being enharmonically equivalent to the flatted third or tenth and is used as such particularly in blues and other jazz standards when superscripted numerals are used the different numbers may be listed horizontally or vertically an added tone chord is a traditional chord with an extra added note such as the commonly added sixth this includes chords with an added second or fourth or a combination of the three these chords do not include intervening thirds as in an extended chord added chords can also have variations thus madd9 m4 and m6 are minor triads with extended notes sixth chords are chords that contain any of the various intervals of a sixth as a defining characteristic they can be considered as belonging to either of two separate groups chords that contain a sixth chord member i e a note separated by the interval of a sixth from the chord s root such as in western music the most common use of augmented sixth chords is to resolve to a dominant chord in root position or to a tonic chord in second inversion in this case the tonic note of the key is included in the chord sometimes along with an optional fourth note to create one of the following the augmented sixth family of chords exhibits certain peculiarities since they are not triad based as are seventh chords and other sixth chords they are not generally regarded as having roots although one re voicing of the notes is common inverted chords in which the interval of a sixth appears above the bass note rather than the root inversions traditionally being so named from their characteristic interval of a sixth from the bass a suspended chord or sus chord is a chord in which the third has been displaced by either of its dissonant neighbouring notes forming intervals of a major second or a perfect fourth with the root this results in two distinct chord types the suspended second and the suspended fourth the chords csus2 and csus4 for example consist of the notes c d g and c f g respectively extended versions are also possible such as the seventh suspended fourth for example which with root c contains the notes c f g b and is notated as c7sus4 play csus4 is sometimes written csus since the sus4 is more common than the sus2 the name suspended derives from an early voice leading technique developed during the common practice period of composition in which an anticipated stepwise melodic progression to a harmonically stable note in any particular part was often momentarily delayed or suspended simply by extending the duration of the previous note the resulting unexpected dissonance could then be all the more satisfyingly resolved by the eventual appearance of the displaced note in modern usage without regard to such considerations of voice leading the term suspended is restricted to those chords involving the displacement of the third only and the dissonant second or fourth no longer needs to be prepared from the previous chord neither is it now obligatory for the displaced note to make an appearance at all however in the majority of occurrences of suspended chords the conventional stepwise resolution to the third is still observed note that in traditional music theory the inclusion of the third in either the suspended second or suspended fourth chords negates the effect of suspension and such chords are properly called added ninth and added eleventh chords rather than suspended chords a notable exception to this analysis of suspended chords occurs in jazz theory in post bop and modal jazz compositions and improvisations suspended seventh chords are often used in nontraditional ways in these contexts they often do not function as v chords and do not resolve the fourth to the third the lack of resolution gives the chord an ambiguous static quality indeed the third is often played on top of a sus4 chord in jazz theory this doesn t negate the quality of the chord as a suspended chord a good example is the jazz standard maiden voyage borrowed chords are chords borrowed from the parallel minor or major if the root of the borrowed chord is not in the original key then they are named by the accidental for instance in major a chord built on the parallel minor s sixth degree is a flat six chord written vi borrowed chords are an example of mode mixture if a chord is borrowed from the parallel key this is usually indicated directly or explained in a footnote or accompanying text if there is no mention of tonality upper case can be taken as the major and lower case as minor polychords are two or more chords superimposed on top of one another see also altered chord secundal chord quartal and quintal harmony and tristan chord chords can be notated in abbreviated manner using pop chord symbols usually written above the given lyrics or staff although these symbols are used occasionally in classical music as well they are most common for lead sheets and fake books in jazz and other popular music pop chord symbols are given under the chord symbol column in the tables of this article chords are commonly played in sequence much as notes are played in sequence to form melodies chord sequences can be conceptualised either in a simplistic way in which the root notes of the chords play simple melodies while tension is created and relieved by increasing and decreasing dissonance or full attention can be paid to each note in every chord in which case chord sequences can be regarded as multi part harmony of unlimited complexity a nonchord tone is a dissonant or unstable tone which is not a part of the chord that is currently playing and in most cases quickly resolves to a chord tone a chord is only the harmonic function of a group of notes and it is unnecessary for all the notes to be played together for example broken chords and arpeggios are ways of playing notes in succession so that they form chords one of the most familiar broken chord figures is alberti bass since simultaneity is not a required feature of chords there has been some academic discussion regarding the point at which a group of notes can be called a chord jean jacques nattiez explains that we can encounter pure chords in a musical work such as in the promenade of modest mussorgsky s pictures at an exhibition however often we must go from a textual given to a more abstract representation of the chords being used as in claude debussy s première arabesque the chords on the second stave shown here are abstracted from the notes in the actual piece shown on the first for a sound configuration to be recognized as a chord it must have a certain duration goldman elaborates the sense of harmonic relation change or effect depends on speed as well as on the relative duration of single notes or triadic units both absolute time and relative time must at all times be taken into account in harmonic thinking or analysis 
bluegrass music is a form of american roots music and is a sub genre of country music it has its own roots in irish scottish welsh and english traditional music bluegrass was inspired by the music of immigrants from the united kingdom and ireland as well as jazz and blues in bluegrass as in jazz each instrument takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it while the others perform accompaniment this is in contrast to old time music in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment traditional bluegrass is typically based around acoustic stringed instruments such as mandolin acoustic guitar banjo fiddle and upright bass with or without vocals unlike mainstream country music bluegrass relies mostly on acoustic stringed instruments the fiddle five string banjo acoustic guitar mandolin and upright bass are often joined by the resonator guitar this instrumentation originated in rural dance bands and was being abandoned by those groups when picked up by european american musicians instrumental solos are improvised and are frequently technically demanding the acoustic guitar is now most commonly played with a flatpick unlike the style of lester flatt who used a thumb and finger pick the style is known as flatpicking the banjo players often use a three finger style developed by earl scruggs bluegrass musicians fans and scholars have long debated what instrumentation constitutes a bluegrass band since the term bluegrass came from bill monroe s band the blue grass boys many consider the instruments used in his band the traditional bluegrass instruments these were the mandolin the fiddle guitar banjo and upright bass at times the musicians may perform gospel songs singing four part harmony and including no or sparse instrumentation bluegrass bands have included instruments as diverse as the resonator guitar accordion harmonica piano autoharp drums drum kit electric guitar and electric versions of all other common bluegrass instruments though these are considered to be more progressive and are a departure from the traditional bluegrass style besides instrumentation a distinguishing characteristic of bluegrass is vocal harmony featuring two three or four parts often featuring a dissonant or modal sound in the highest voice this vocal style has been characterized as the high lonesome sound there is also an emphasis on traditional songs often with sentimental or religious themes bluegrass as a style developed during the mid 1940s because of war rationing recording was limited during that time and it would be most accurate to say that bluegrass was played some time after world war ii but no earlier as with any musical genre no one person can claim to have invented it rather bluegrass is an amalgam of old time music country ragtime and jazz nevertheless bluegrass s beginnings can be traced to one band today bill monroe is referred to as the founding father of bluegrass music the bluegrass style was named for his band the blue grass boys formed in 1939 the 1945 addition of banjo player earl scruggs who played with a three finger roll originally developed by snuffy jenkins but now almost universally known as scruggs style is considered the key moment in the development of this genre monroe s 1946 to 1948 band which featured scruggs singer guitarist lester flatt fiddler chubby wise and bassist howard watts also known as cedric rainwater sometimes called the original bluegrass band created the definitive sound and instrumental configuration that remains a model to this day by some arguments as long as the blue grass boys were the only band playing this music it was just their unique style it could not be considered a musical style until other bands began performing in similar fashion in 1947 the stanley brothers recorded the traditional song molly and tenbrooks in the blue grass boys style and this could also be pointed to as the beginning of bluegrass as a style as ralph stanley himself says about the origins of the genre oh was the first but it wasn t called bluegrass back then it was just called old time mountain hillbilly music when they started doing the bluegrass festivals in 1965 everybody got together and wanted to know what to call the show y know it was decided that since bill was the oldest man and was from the bluegrass state of kentucky and he had the blue grass boys it would be called bluegrass bluegrass was generally used for dancing in the rural areas a dancing style known as buckdancing flat footing or clogging but eventually spread to more urban areas and became more popular bluegrass is typically performed on acoustic non electric instruments since the genre originated before widespread availability of household electricity electric instruments were frowned upon by conservative country music people like the founder of the grand ole opry george d hay in 1948 bluegrass emerged as a genre within the post war country music industry this period of time is characterized as the golden era or wellsprings of traditional bluegrass bluegrass is not and never was folk music under a strict definition however the topical and narrative themes of many bluegrass songs are highly reminiscent of folk music in fact many songs that are widely considered to be bluegrass are older works legitimately classified as folk or old time music performed in a bluegrass style from its earliest days to today bluegrass has been recorded and performed by professional musicians although amateur bluegrass musicians and trends such as parking lot picking are too important to be ignored it is professional musicians who have set the direction of the style while bluegrass is not folk music in that strict sense the interplay between bluegrass music and folk forms has been studied folklorist dr neil rosenberg for example shows that most devoted bluegrass fans and musicians are familiar with traditional folk songs and old time music and that these songs are often played at shows and festivals first generation bluegrass musicians dominated the genre from its beginnings in the mid 1940s through the mid 1960s this group generally consists of those who were playing during the golden age in the 1950s including bill monroe and his blue grass boys the stanley brothers lester flatt earl scruggs with the foggy mountain boys ervin t rouse who wrote the standard orange blossom special reno and smiley the sauceman brothers lonesome pine fiddlers jim jesse jimmy martin and the osborne brothers mac wiseman mac martin and the dixie travelers carl story and his rambling mountaineers buzz busby the lilly brothers jim eanes and earl taylor a second generation of bluegrass musicians began performing composing and recording came in the mid to late 1960s although many had played in first generation bands from a young age some bluegrass musicians in this group are j d crowe doyle lawson sam bush john hartford norman blake frank wakefield harley red allen bill keith del mccoury and tony rice as they refined their craft the new grass revival seldom scene the kentucky colonels and the dillards developed progressive bluegrass in one collaboration first generation bluegrass fiddler vassar clements progressive mandolin player david grisman grateful dead frontman jerry garcia and peter rowan on lead vocals played in the band called old and in the way garcia helped introduce rock music listeners to progressive and traditional bluegrass third generation bluegrass developed in the mid 1980s bluegrass grew matured and broadened from the music played in previous years this generation redefined mainstream bluegrass high quality sound equipment allowed each band member to be miked independently and a wall of sound style developed exemplified by tony rice unit and the bluegrass album band tony rice showcased elaborate lead guitar solos and other bands followed the electric bass became a general but not universal alternative to the traditional acoustic bass though electrification of other instruments continued to meet resistance outside progressive circles nontraditional chord progressions also became more widely accepted on the other hand this generation saw a renaissance of more traditional songs played in the newer style the johnson mountain boys were one of the decade s most popular touring groups and played strictly traditional bluegrass in recent decades bluegrass music has reached a broader audience major mainstream country music performers have recorded bluegrass albums including dolly parton and patty loveless who each released several bluegrass albums since the late 1990s ricky skaggs who began as a bluegrass musician and crossed over to mainstream country in the 1980s returned to bluegrass with his band kentucky thunder the coen brothers released the movie o brother where art thou in with an oldtime and bluegrass soundtrack and the down from the mountain music tour and documentary resulting meanwhile bands like rocky grass and yonder mountain string band in the united states and druhá tráva in the czech republic attract large audiences while expanding the range of progressive bluegrass in the college jam band atmospheres often called jamgrass bluegrass fused with jazz in the music of bela fleck and the flecktones tony rice sam bush doc watson and others there are three major sub genres of bluegrass and an unofficial sub genre traditional bluegrass emphasizes the traditional elements musicians play folk songs songs with simple traditional chord progressions and use only acoustic instruments generally they play compositions on instrument like bill monroe and the blue grass boys played in the late 1940s in the early years traditional bluegrass sometimes included instruments no longer accepted in mainstream bluegrass such as the accordion and harmonica traditional bands may use bluegrass instruments in slightly different ways for example playing the banjo by the claw hammer style or using multiple guitars or fiddles in a band in this sub genre the guitar rarely leads but acts as a rhythm instrument one notable exception being gospel songs melodies and lyrics tend to be simple and a i iv v chord pattern is common traditional bluegrass bands ralph stanley and the clinch mountain boys larry sparks and the lonesome ramblers the del mccoury band ricky skaggs and kentucky thunder doyle lawson and quicksilver and dan paisley and the southern grass enjoy nationwide popularity another major sub genre is progressive bluegrass roughly synonymous with newgrass the latter term is attributed to new grass revival member ebo walker some groups began using electric instruments and importing songs from other genres particularly rock roll progressive bluegrass became popular in the late 1960s and 1970s however progressive bluegrass has roots going back to one of the earliest bluegrass bands the banjo and bass duets earl scruggs played even in the earliest days of the foggy mountain boys hint at the wild chord progressions to come the four key distinguishing elements of progressive bluegrass are instrumentation songs imported from other genres chord progressions and lengthy jam band style improvisation string cheese incident is one band that sometimes mixes a bluegrass tune with a jam band feeling especially in original tunes like dudley s kitchen a twist on this genre is combining elements that preceded bluegrass such as old time string band music with bluegrass music bluegrass gospel has emerged as a third sub genre nearly all bluegrass artists incorporate gospel music into their repertoire distinctive elements of this style include christian lyrics soulful three or four part harmony singing and sometimes playing instrumentals subdue a cappella choruses are popular with bluegrass gospel artists though the harmony structure differs somewhat from standard barbershop or choir singing mainstream bluegrass artists doyle lawson quicksilver and third tyme out have produced extraordinary bluegrass gospel music while the issacs mount zion and the churchmen play blue gospel exclusively a newer development in the bluegrass world is neo traditional bluegrass in the 1990s most bluegrass bands were headed by a solo artist such as doyle lawson and rhonda vincent with an accompanying band bands playing this sub genre include the grascals mountain heart the infamous stringdusters steep canyon rangers and cherryholmes alternative country  australian country  bakersfield sound  bluegrass  close harmony  country blues  country pop  country rock  country rap  honky tonk  lubbock sound  nashville sound  neotraditional country  outlaw country  rockabilly  texas country music  truck driving country
tool is a grammy award winning american rock band from los angeles california formed in 1990 since its inception the band s line up has included drummer danny carey guitarist adam jones and vocalist maynard james keenan the current bassist is justin chancellor who has been with the band since 1995 tool is known to have rigorous touring schedules in support of their albums they have performed well on charts worldwide and have sold an estimated 9 25 million records in the us alone tool emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first album undertow at a time when the genre was dominated by thrash metal and later reached the top of the alternative metal movement with the release of their second album ænima in 1996 their efforts to unify musical experimentation visual arts and a message of personal evolution continued with their third record lateralus in 2001 and their most recent album 10 000 days released in 2006 gained the band critical acclaim and success around the world due to tool s incorporation of visual arts and relatively long and complex releases the band is generally described as a style transcending act and part of progressive rock and art rock the relationship between the band and today s music industry is ambivalent at times marked by censorship and the band members insistence on privacy during the 1980s each of the future members of tool moved to los angeles both paul d amour and adam jones wanted to enter the film industry while maynard james keenan found employment remodeling pet stores after having studied visual arts in michigan danny carey performed as a drummer for wild blue yonder green jellÿ and carole king and played in the los angeles area with pigmy love circus keenan and jones met through a common friend in 1989 after keenan played a tape recording for jones of his previous band project jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band they started jamming together and were on the lookout for a drummer and a bass player danny carey happened to live above keenan and was introduced to jones by tom morello an old high school friend of jones and former bandmate of electric sheep carey began playing in their sessions because he felt kinda sorry for them as other invited musicians were not showing up tool s lineup was completed when a friend of jones introduced them to bassist d amour early on the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy lachrymology although lachrymology was also explained to be an inspiration for the band s name keenan later explained their intentions differently tool is exactly what it sounds like it s a big dick it s a wrench  we are your tool use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out or whatever it is you re trying to achieve after only a few gigs the band was approached by record companies and only three months into their career they signed a record deal with zoo entertainment in march 1992 zoo published the band s first effort opiate described by the band as slam and bang heavy metal and the hardest sounding six songs they had written to that point the ep included the singles hush and opiate the band s first music video hush promoted their dissenting views about the then prominent parents music resource center and its advocacy of the censorship of music the video featured the band members naked with their genitalia covered by parental advisory stickers and their mouths covered by duct tape the band began touring with rollins band skitzo fishbone and rage against the machine to positive responses which janiss garza of rip magazine summarized in september 1992 as a buzz and a strong start the following year at a time when alternative rock was at its height tool released their first full length album undertow it expressed more diverse dynamics than opiate and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release when they had opted for a heavier sound the band began touring again as planned with an exception in may 1993 tool was scheduled to play the garden pavilion in hollywood but learned at the last minute that the garden pavilion belonged to l ron hubbard s church of scientology which the band felt clashed with the band s ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being keenan spent most of the show baa ing like a sheep at the audience tool later played several concerts during the lollapalooza road show and were moved from the second stage to the main stage by their manager and the festival co founder ted gardner at the last concert of lollapalooza in tool s hometown los angeles comedian bill hicks introduced the band hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in undertow s liner notes he jokingly asked the audience of 60 000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens the boost in popularity gained from these concerts led undertow to be certified gold by the riaa in september 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995 despite being sold with a censored album cover by distributors such as wal mart the single sober became a hit single by march 1994 and won the band billboard s best video by a new artist award for the accompanying stop motion music video with the release of tool s follow up single prison sex the band again became the target of censorship the song s lyrics and video dealt with child abuse which sparked controversial reactions keenan s lyrics begin with it took so long to remember just what happened i was so young and vestal then you know it hurt me but i m breathing so i guess i m still alive the video was created primarily by guitarist adam jones who saw it as his surrealistic interpretation of the subject matter and while some contemporary journalists again praised the video and described the lyrics as metaphoric the american branch of muchmusic asked keenan to represent the band in a hearing it deemed the respective music video too graphic and obscene and mtv stopped airing it after a few viewings in september 1995 the band entered the studios to record their second album at that time tool experienced its only lineup change to date with bassist d amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects justin chancellor a member of former tourmates peach eventually replaced d amour having been chosen over competitors such as kyuss scott reeder filter s frank cavanaugh pigmy love circus s e shepherd stevenson and zaum s marco fox after paul d amour left tool justin chancellor came on board and the recording of the already begun ænima continued the band enlisted the help of producer david bottrill who had produced some of king crimson s albums while jones collaborated with cam de leon to create ænima s grammy nominated artwork the album was released on october 1st 1996 the album was dedicated to satirist bill hicks who had died two and a half years earlier the band intended to raise awareness about hicks s material and ideas because they felt that tool and hicks were resonating similar concepts in particular ænima s final track third eye is preceded by a clip of hicks performances and both the lenticular casing of the ænima album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track ænema make reference to a sketch from hicks s arizona bay in which he contemplates the idea of los angeles falling into the pacific ocean the first single stinkfist obtained limited and imperfect airplay it was shortened by radio programmers mtv renamed the music video of stinkfist to track 1 due to offensive connotations and the lyrics of the song were altered responding to fan complaints about censorship matt pinfield of mtv s 120 minutes expressed regret on air by waving his fist in front of his face while introducing the video and explaining the name change a tour began in october 1996 only two weeks after ænima s release following numerous appearances in the united states and europe tool headed for australia and new zealand in late march 1997 april 1 of that year saw the first of several april fools pranks related to the band kabir akhtar webmaster of the band s semi official fanpage the tool page wrote that at least three of the band are listed in critical condition after a tour bus accident on a highway this hoax gained wide attention and was eventually exposed on radio and mtv akhtar later posted an apology claiming that the tool page will not indulge itself in such outlandish pranks in the future a claim that would be belied by later april fools pranks the tour continued the next day as originally announced eventually returning to the united states tool appeared at lollapalooza 97 in july this time as a headliner where they gained critical praise from the new york times tool was returning in triumph to lollapalooza after appearing among the obscure bands on the festival s smaller stage in 1993 now tool is the prime attraction for a festival that s struggling to maintain its purpose tool uses taboo breaking imagery for hellfire moralizing in songs that swerve from bitter reproach to nihilistic condemnation its music has refined all the troubled majesty of grunge notwithstanding a decline in popularity of alternative rock music during the mid 90s in the united states ænima eventually matched tool s successful debut in sales the progressive influenced ænima landed the band at the head of the alternative metal genre it featured the grammy award winning ænema and appeared on several best albums of 1996 lists with notable examples being those of kerrang and terrorizer a legal battle that began the same year interfered with the band s working on another release volcano entertainment the successor of tool s by then defunct label zoo entertainment alleged contract violations by tool and filed suit according to volcano tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels after tool filed a countersuit stating that volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract the parties settled out of court in december 1998 tool agreed to a new contract a three record joint venture deal in 2000 the band dismissed their long time manager ted gardner who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement during this time keenan joined the band a perfect circle which was founded by long time tool guitar tech billy howerdel while jones joined the melvins buzz osborne and carey drummed with dead kennedys jello biafra on other side projects although there were rumors that tool were breaking up chancellor jones and carey were working on new material while waiting for keenan to return in 2000 the salival box set was released effectively putting an end to the rumors the cd contained one new original track a cover of led zeppelin s no quarter a live version of peach s you lied and revised versions of old songs the vhs and the dvd each contained four music videos plus a bonus music video for hush on the dvd although salival did not yield any singles the hidden track maynard s dick briefly found its way to fm radio when several djs chose to play it on air under the title maynard s dead in january 2001 tool announced a new album systema encéphale along with a 12 song tracklist containing titles such as riverchrist numbereft encephatalis musick and coeliacus file sharing networks such as napster were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles names at the time tool members were outspokenly critical of file sharing networks in general due to the negative impact on artists that are dependent on success in record sales to continue their career keenan had this to say during an interview with ny rock in 2000 i think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed the ones who get hurt by mp3s are not so much companies or the business but the artists people who are trying to write songs a month later the band revealed that the new album was actually titled lateralus and that the name systema encéphale and the tracklist had been a ruse lateralus and the corresponding tours would take tool a step further toward art rock and progressive rock territory rolling stone wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that drums bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near silent death march the prolonged running times of most of lateralus thirteen tracks are misleading the entire album rolls and stomps with suitelike purpose joshua klein of the a v club in turn expressed his opinion that lateralus with its 79 minutes and relatively complex and long songs topped by the ten and a half minute music video for parabola posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike the album became a worldwide success reaching 1 on the u s billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week tool received their second grammy award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song schism during the band s acceptance speech drummer carey stated that he would like to thank his parents and satan and bassist chancellor concluded i want to thank my dad for doing my mom extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported lateralus and included a personal highlight for the band a 10 show joint mini tour with king crimson in august 2001 comparisons between the two were made mtv describing the bands as the once and future kings of progressive rock keenan stated of the minitour for me being on stage with king crimson is like lenny kravitz playing with led zeppelin or britney spears onstage with debbie gibson although the end of the tour in november 2002 seemed to signal the start of another dormancy for the band they did not become completely inactive while keenan recorded and toured with a perfect circle the other band members released an interview and a recording of new material both exclusive to the fan club on april 1 2005 the official tool website announced that maynard has found jesus and would be abandoning the recording of the new tool album temporarily and possibly permanently kurt loder of mtv contacted keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation when loder asked again keenan s response was simply heh heh however on april 7 the official site explained good news april fools fans the writing and recording is back under way the writing and recording proceeded for the follow up to lateralus meanwhile a lateralus vinyl edition and two dvd singles were released and the band s official website received a new splash intro by artist joshua davis the double vinyl four picture disc edition of lateralus was first released as a limited autographed edition exclusively available to fan club members and publicly released on august 23 2005 on december 20 2005 the two dvds were released one containing the single schism and the other parabola a remix by lustmord and the music video with commentary by david yow and jello biafra respectively fifteen years into the band s career tool had acquired what dan epstein of revolver described as a devoted cult following and as details about the band s next album emerged such as the influence of lateralus tourmates fantômas and meshuggah rumors surrounding new tool again surfaced the main controversy was the album title after rumored titles such as teleincision had been dismissed a news item on the official tool website announced that the new album s name was 10 000 days nevertheless speculation continued it was alleged that 10 000 days was merely a decoy album to fool audiences until the day of release which eventually proved false when a leaked copy of the album was distributed via filesharing networks a week prior to its official release the album opener vicarious premiered on u s radio stations on april 17 the record followed on may 2 2006 in the u s and debuted at the top spots of various international charts 10 000 days sold 564 000 copies in its opening week in the u s and was number one on the billboard 200 charts doubling the sales of pearl jam s self titled album its closest competitor however 10 000 days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor lateralus had been after the release of 10 000 days a tour kicked off at coachella on april 30 2006 the touring schedule was similar to the lateralus tour of 2001 supporting acts were isis and mastodon during a short break early the next year after touring australia and new zealand drummer danny carey suffered a biceps tear during a skirmish with his girlfriend s dog casting uncertainty on the band s upcoming concerts in north america carey underwent surgery on february 21 and several gigs had to be postponed back on tour by april tool appeared on june 15 as a headliner at the bonnaroo music festival with a guest appearance from rage against the machine s tom morello on lateralus meanwhile vicarious was a nominee for best hard rock performance and 10 000 days won best recording package at the 49th grammy awards the music video for vicarious was released on dvd on december 18 in an interview conducted in may 2007 justin chancellor stated that the band would probably continue their tour until early 2008 and then take some time off he qualified this statement by adding that the band has already written new material and would surely release another album at some point down the road a possible project until a next album is to make a band movie a possibility the band has reportedly considered for a long time the ideas range from a narrative story in a surreal fashion with as much money and special effects as possible to pockets of all of that or something that s live or the band playing although carey stated that the necessary know how was at hand due to the many relations to artists working in the movie business jones dismissed the idea saying it s just talk right now according to rolling stone after the 50th grammy awards while attending a sony bmg after party at the beverly hills hotel keenan promised another tool album asked in an early 2009 interview with guitar world about the new album jones replied it s been coming along great no we ve been on hiatus i m writing and justin s been writing but maynard has been working on his wine we ve all just been taking some time away from each other which has been nice i ve also been working on producing some comics tool has been on vacation since early 2008 although keenan said that he expects the band to begin writing a new album sometime this year on march 24 2009 the band s official website confirmed a tool summer tour with dates soon to be announced tool has gained critical praise from the international herald tribune s c b liddell for their complex and ever evolving sound describing their general sound allmusic refers to them as grinding post jane s addiction heavy metal and the new york times sees similarities to led zeppelin s heaving battering guitar riffs and middle eastern modes their 2001 work lateralus was compared by allmusic to pink floyd s meddle but thirty years later and altered by tool s impulse to cram every inch of infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread a component of tool s song repertoire relies on the use of unusual time signatures for instance bassist justin chancellor describes the time signature employed on lateralus s first single schism as 6 5 8 and that it later goes into all kinds of other times lateralus the album s title track also displays shifting rhythms as does 10 000 days wings for marie and 10 000 days beyond this aspect of the band s sound each band member experiments within his musical scope bass player magazine described chancellor s bass playing as a thick midrange tone guitar style techniques and elastic versatility as an example of this the magazine mentioned the use of a wah effect by hammering the notes with the left hand and using the bass s tone controls to get a tone sweep such as on the song the patient completing the band s rhythm section drummer danny carey uses polyrhythms tabla style techniques and the incorporation of custom electronic drum pads to trigger samples such as prerecorded tabla and octoban sounds maynard james keenan s ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the seattle post intelligencer after his performance during an alice in chains reunion concert in 2005 freelancer travis hay saw him as a natural fit at replacing layne staley regarding his role in a perfect circle and tool the new york times wrote that both groups rely on mr keenan s ability to dignify emotions like lust anger and disgust the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity according to guitar player magazine adam jones does not rely on any one particular guitar playing technique but rather combines many techniques for example allmusic wrote that he alternately utiliz power chords scratchy noise chiming arpeggios and a quiet minimalism in sober additionally the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation like the use of a pipe bomb microphone and a talk box guitar solo on jambi the band puts an emphasis on the sound of their songs and attempts to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with any album lyrical arrangements are often given special attention such as in lateralus the number of syllables per line in the lyrics to lateralus correspond to an arrangement of the fibonacci numbers and the song jambi uses and makes a reference to the common metrical foot iamb the lyrics on ænima and lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality specific subjects range from organized religion in opiate to evolution and jungian psychology in forty six 2 and transcendence in lateralus on 10 000 days keenan wanted to explore issues more personal to him the album name and title track refer to the twenty seven years during which his mother suffered from complications of a stroke until her death in 2003 the band has named the melvins among those that influenced their development but the most publicized influence are progressive rock pioneers king crimson longtime king crimson member robert fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on tool in an interview with tool he touched briefly on how the two bands relate to each other do you hear the influence there s just one figure where i hear an influence just one it was a piece we were developing that we dropped and it s almost exactly the same figure three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar so i do not think you could have heard it that s the only thing he also stated i happen to be a tool fan the members of tool have been generous enough to suggest that crimson has been an influence on them adam jones asked me if i could detect it in their music and i said i couldn t i can detect more tool influence in king crimson than i can hear king crimson in tool in turn maloof and newquists attribute to tool an influence on modern metal in its own right in their book the new metal masters sean richardson of the boston phoenix sees system of a down deftones and godsmack as examples of tool s towering influence on the genre moreover keenan s unique style of singing has been repeatedly seen as influencing artists such as pete loeffler of chevelle part of tool s work as a band is to incorporate influences of other works of art in their music videos live shows and album packaging in particular adam jones doubles as the band s art director and director of their music videos another expression of this is an official website dedicated to the arts and influences on the band dissectional com the band has released eight music videos but made personal appearances in only the first two which the band states is to prevent people from latching onto the personalities involved rather than listening to the music with the exception of hush and vicarious all of tool s music videos feature stop motion animation to some extent the videos are created primarily by adam jones often in collaboration with artists such as chet zar alex grey and osseus labyrint the sober music video in particular attracted much attention jones explained that it doesn t contain a storyline but that his intentions were to summon personal emotions with its imagery rolling stone described this imagery by stating that in the video evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat coursing through pipes in the wall and called it a groundbreaking epic clip billboard voted it best video by a new artist the video for vicarious was released on dvd on december 18 2007 the video is also notable because it is the first tool video to be produced entirely through the use of cgi adam jones is responsible for most of the band s artwork concepts their first album undertow featured a ribcage sculpture by jones on its cover and photos contributed by the band members later albums included artwork by collaborating artists ænima and salival featured works by cam de leon lateralus and 10 000 days were created with the help of alex grey the releases garnered positive critical reception with a music journalist of the associated press attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging both ænima and 10 000 days were nominated for the grammy award for best recording package but while the former failed to win in 1997 the latter did win in 2006 as art director adam jones created packaging for 10 000 days that features a pair of stereoscopic lenses for viewing 3 d artwork and photos jones has been a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography and expressed a desire for the packaging to be unique and to reflect the 70s artwork he appreciates following their first tours in the early nineties tool has performed as a headline act in world tours and major festivals such as lollapalooza coachella download festival roskilde big day out and bonnaroo they have been joined on stage by numerous artists such as buzz osborne and scott reeder on several occasions tom morello and zack de la rocha during their 1991 tour tricky robert fripp mike patton dave lombardo brann dailor of mastodon and experimental arts duo osseus labyrint during their 2001 02 lateralus tour and kirk hammett phil campbell serj tankian and tom morello during their 2006 07 tour they have covered songs by led zeppelin ted nugent peach kyuss and the ramones live shows on tool s headline tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display singer maynard james keenan lines up in the back with drummer danny carey on an elevated platform while guitarist adam jones and bassist justin chancellor stand in the front toward the side edges of the stage keenan despite being the vocalist is known to face the backdrop rather than the audience no followspots or live cameras are used instead the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd breckinridge haggerty the band s live video director explains that the resulting dark spaces on stage are for maynard a lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he feels more comfortable in the shadows the big screens are used to play back looped clips that aren t tracked to a song like a music video the band has never used any sort of timecode they ve always made sure the video can change on the fly in a way that can be improvised the show is never the same twice during the 10 000 days tour the video material consisted of over six hours of material created by adam jones his wife camella grace chet zar meats meier and breckinridge haggerty some of the material created by chet zar has been released on his dvd disturb the normal 
as built after refit ss edmund fitzgerald was an american great lakes freighter launched on 8 june 1958 until the 1970s she was the largest ship on the great lakes although it had reported having some difficulties during a gale on lake superior the fitzgerald sank suddenly on 10 november 1975 in 530 feet of water without sending any distress signals the site of the loss is at 46 59 9 n 85 06 6 w  46 9983 n 85 11 w 46 9983 85 11 in canadian waters approximately 17 miles from the entrance to whitefish bay all 29 hands in the crew perished presumably by drowning the incident is the most famous disaster in the history of great lakes shipping and is the subject of gordon lightfoot s hit song the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald the precise cause of her sinking remains a mystery on 1 february 1957 northwestern mutual life insurance company of milwaukee wisconsin contracted great lakes engineering works of river rouge michigan to design and build a taconite bulk carrier laker for northwestern the contract contained the stipulation that the boat be the largest on the great lakes glew laid the keel on 7 august of that year and some time between then and her christening and launch on 7 june 1958 northwestern announced their decision to name the boat for their president and chairman of the board edmund fitzgerald whose own father had himself been a lake captain the completed vessel had a capacity of 26 600 tons her large cargo hold loaded through twenty one watertight hatches 11 feet 7 inches by 54 feet of 5 16 inch steel the boat s boilers were originally coal fired but would be converted to burn oil during the 1971 72 winter layup with a length of 729 feet she met the demanding stipulation of the contract and until 1971 was the largest boat on the great lakes over 15 000 people attended the fitzgerald s launch the event was troublesome when mrs edmund fitzgerald christened the boat by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow it took her three swings to break the bottle the launch was delayed 36 minutes while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks upon launching sideways into the water the boat crashed violently into a dock sea trials for the fitzgerald began on 13 september 1958 and northwestern handed the operation of the boat to the columbia transportation division of the oglebay norton corporation one week later for the next 17 years the fitzgerald carried taconite from mines near duluth minnesota to iron works in detroit toledo and other ports prior to the events of 9 november 1975 she suffered five collisions running aground in 1969 colliding with the s s hochelaga in 1970 and then striking the wall of a lock later in the same year hitting a lock s wall again in 1973 and then again the following year she also lost her original bow anchor in the detroit river in 1974 fitzgerald left superior wisconsin on the afternoon of sunday 9 november 1975 under captain ernest m mcsorley she was en route to the steel mill on zug island near detroit michigan with a full cargo of taconite a second freighter arthur m anderson destined for gary indiana out of two harbors minnesota joined up with fitzgerald fitzgerald being the faster ship took the lead while anderson trailed not far behind crossing lake superior at about 13 knots the boats encountered a massive winter storm reporting winds in excess of 50 knots and waves as high as 35 feet because of the storm the soo locks at sault ste marie were closed the freighters altered their courses northward seeking shelter along the canadian coast later they would cross to whitefish bay to approach the locks late in the afternoon of monday 10 november sustained winds of 50 knots were observed across eastern lake superior anderson was struck by a 75 knot hurricane force gust at 3 30 pm fitzgerald radioed anderson to report a minor list developing and top side damage including the loss of radar visibility was poor due to heavy snow and the coast guard warned all ships to find safe harbor fitzgerald s two bilge pumps were running continuously to discharge shipped water the lighthouse and navigational radio beacon at whitefish point had also been knocked out by the storm fitzgerald was ahead of anderson at the time effectively blind therefore she slowed to come within 10 miles range so she could receive radar guidance from the other ship for a time anderson directed the fitzgerald toward the relative safety of whitefish bay at 5 45 pm captain mcsorley radioed another ship avafors to report that fitzgerald was suffering a bad list had lost her radars and had seas washing over her decks mcsorley described the situation as one of the worst seas i ve ever been in the last communication from the doomed ship came at approximately 7 10 pm when anderson notified fitzgerald of being hit by rogue waves large enough to be caught on radar that were heading fitzgerald s way and asked how she was doing mcsorley reported we are holding our own a few minutes later she apparently sank no distress signal was received ten minutes later anderson could neither raise fitzgerald by radio nor detect her on radar at 8 32 pm anderson informed the u s coast guard of its concern for the ship once anderson noted the loss of fitzgerald a search was launched for survivors the initial search consisted of the arthur m anderson and a second freighter ss william clay ford the efforts of a third freighter the canadian vessel hilda marjanne were foiled by the weather the u s coast guard launched three aircraft but could not mobilize any ships a coast guard buoy tender woodrush was able to launch within two and a half hours but took a day to arrive the search recovered debris including lifeboats and rafts but no survivors the wreck was first located by a u s navy aircraft with on board magnetic anomaly detector equipment normally used to detect submarines the wreck was further surveyed using side scan sonar on 14 november to 16 november by the coast guard the sonar revealed two large objects lying close together on the lake floor a second survey took place from 22 november through 25 november by a private contractor seaward inc in 1976 from 20 may to 28 may an unmanned u s navy submersible photographed the wreck this submersible curv iii consisted of an underwater vehicle connected via umbilical control to a surface support ship on board imaging equipment included one 35 mm still and two black and white video cameras it found edmund fitzgerald lying in two large pieces in 530 feet of water the bow section approximately 276 feet long lay upright in the mud the stern section lay 170 feet away inverted at a 50 degree angle from the bow metal and taconite heaps between the bow and stern comprised the remnants of the mid section when fitzgerald first vanished it was widely believed the boat had snapped in half on the lake surface owing to storm action similar surface breakups in the past suggested bow and stern sections would be found miles apart on the lake floor when underwater surveys revealed these sections were just yards from each other it was concluded that fitzgerald had instead broken upon hitting the lake floor a coast guard investigation postulated that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures these devices were unable to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold the flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day and finally resulted in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability as a result the boat plummeted to the bottom without warning the coast guard report proved controversial the most common alternative theory contends that inoperative radar forced the crew to rely on inaccurate charts as a result fitzgerald briefly ran aground or scraped a shoal near caribou island without the crew being aware of it consequently she received bottom damage which caused her to gradually take on water until she sank so suddenly in the deep water that none of her crew had time to react the ship pile driving into the lake bottom snapped in half and its stern landed upside down on the bottom this theory is supported by final radio communications between anderson and fitzgerald anderson had been struck by two large waves that were heading toward fitzgerald if the hull had indeed been breached it would be difficult to prove fitzgerald has settled in mud up to her load marks making it impossible to inspect for damage a documentary created and aired by the discovery channel investigated a large fold found in the hull plating previous defects with cargo hold covers and clamps as well as cracking issues were also addressed through the use of wave tanks and computer simulation the discovery channel team concluded the loss of the ss edmund fitzgerald was due to a rogue wave reports show three large waves were detected two of which were reported by the anderson as per the investigation it was theorized that the fitzgerald was badly battered by the first two waves further damaging the dual radar and the hatch covers it was surmised ultimately that the fitzgerald took on water through the damaged cargo hold covers which flooded the ore cargo and severely stressed the ship s hull and was then overwhelmed by the third wave that snapped the weakened ship in half in passing it should be noted that the ss carl d bradley the largest freighter on the lakes and dubbed queen of the lakes until the fitzgerald was launched suffered a similar fate in november 1958 thirty three crew perished and two survived see also ss daniel j morrell moreover losses of even greater magnitude measured by the number of ships involved and lives lost due to a freshwater snow filled hurricane have occurred in the past see great lakes storm of 1913 and great storms of the north american great lakes the day after the wreck mariners church in detroit rang its bell 29 times once for each life lost the church continues to hold an annual memorial reading the names of the crewmen and ringing the church bell on the 12th of november 2006 two days after the 31st anniversary of the sinking of the edmund fitzgerald the church broadened its memorial ceremony to include the more than 6 000 lives lost on the great lakes in 2006 the bell at mariners church tolled eight times not the usual 29 five times for the 5 great lakes a sixth time for the st clair and detroit rivers a seventh for the st lawrence seaway and an eighth time for military personnel whose lives were lost the ship s bell was recovered from the wreck on 4 july 1995 and is now in the great lakes shipwreck museum in whitefish point near paradise michigan an anchor from fitzgerald lost on an earlier trip was recovered from the detroit river and is on display at the dossin great lakes museum in detroit michigan artifacts in the steamship valley camp museum in sault ste marie michigan include two lifeboats photos a movie of the fitzgerald and commemorative models and paintings on every 10th of november the split rock lighthouse in silver bay minnesota emits a light in honor of the edmund fitzgerald coast guard cutter woodrush was replaced by a brand new buoy tender in 2001 uscgc maple on her maiden voyage the maple visited the final resting place of the fitzgerald and dropped the last woodrush life ring down to the wreck on 8 august 2007 a michigan family discovered a lone life saving ring in a provincial park along the shores of lake superior that seemed to be from the fitzgerald it was thought to be a hoax because there are considerable differences in the markings of proven rings found at the wreck site a recent associated press article published 20 august 2007 confirms that the life ring was indeed a memorial not an artifact in 1976 canadian singer songwriter gordon lightfoot recorded the song the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald commemorating the events surrounding the sinking of the ship in 1986 writer steven dietz and songwriter lyricist eric peltoniemi wrote the musical ten november in memory of the fitzgerald s sinking in 2005 the musical was re edited into a new musical called the gales of november which opened on the 30th anniversary of the sinking at the fitzgerald theater in st paul also in 2005 michigan based northern rock band great lakes myth society included audio samples of transmissions from the anderson relaying the suspected loss of the fitzgerald to the coast guard in their song lake effect another 30th anniversary commemoration was a concerto entitled the edmund fitzgerald by american composer geoffrey peterson in 2002 which was premiered by the sault symphony orchestra in sault ste marie ontario canada in november 2005 although she is the latest vessel lost and the largest fitzgerald is not alone on the bottom the great lakes have a long history of nautical disaster nearly 6 000 shipwrecks have occurred since 1878 with about a quarter of those being listed as total losses some ships and crews simply vanished in storms a number of diveable marine preserves have been established that contain multiple sunken ships in 2005 efforts were underway to establish in

vocal range is the measure of the breadth of pitches that a human voice can phonate although the study of vocal range has little practical application in terms of speech it is a topic of study within linguistics phonetics and speech pathology particularly in relation to the study of tonal languages and certain types of vocal disorders however the most common application of the term vocal range is within the context of singing where it is used as one of the major defining characteristics for classifying singing voices into groups known as voice types while the broadest definition of vocal range is simply the span from the lowest to the highest note a particular voice can produce this broad definition is often not what is meant when vocal range is discussed in the context of singing vocal pedagogists tend to define the term vocal range as the total span of musically useful pitches that a singer can produce this is because some of the notes a voice can produce may not be considered usable by the singer within performance for various reasons for example within opera all singers must project over an orchestra without the aid of a microphone an opera singer would therefore only be able to include the notes that they are able to adequately project over an orchestra within their vocal range in contrast a pop artist could include notes that could be heard with the aid of a microphone another factor to consider is the use of different forms of vocal production the human voice is capable of producing sounds using different physiological processes within the larynx these different forms of voice production are known as vocal registers while the exact number and definition of vocal registers is a controversial topic within the field of singing the sciences identify only four registers the whistle register the falsetto register the modal register and the vocal fry register typically only the usable range of the modal register the register used in normal speech and most singing is used when determining vocal range however there are some instances where other vocal registers are included for example within opera countertenors utilize falsetto often and coloratura sopranos utilize the whistle register frequently these voice types would therefore include the notes from these other registers within their vocal range another example would be a male doo wop singer who might quite regularly deploy his falsetto pitches in performance and thus include them in determining his range however in most cases only the usable pitches within the modal register are included when determining a singer s vocal range vocal range plays such an important role in classifying singing voices into voice types that sometimes the two terms are confused with one another a voice type is a particular kind of human singing voice perceived as having certain identifying qualities or characteristics vocal range being only one of those characteristics other factors are vocal weight vocal tessitura vocal timbre vocal transition points physical characteristics speech level scientific testing and vocal registration all of these factors combined are used to categorize a singer s voice into a particular kind of singing voice or voice type there are a plethora of different voice types used by vocal pedagogists today in a variety of voice classification systems most of these types however are sub types that fall under seven different major voice categories that are for the most part acknowledged across all of the major voice classification systems women are typically divided into three groups soprano mezzo soprano and contralto men are usually divided into four groups countertenor tenor baritone and bass when considering the pre pubescent voices of children an eighth term treble can be applied within each of these major categories there are several sub categories that identify specific vocal qualities like coloratura facility and vocal weight to differentiate between voices vocal range in and of itself can not determine a singer s voice type while each voice type does have a general vocal range associated with it human singing voices may possess vocal ranges that encompass more than one voice type or are in between the typical ranges of two voice types therefore voice teachers only use vocal range as one factor in classifying a singer s voice more important than range in voice classification is tessitura or where the voice is most comfortable singing and vocal timbre or the characteristic sound of the singing voice for example a female singer may have a vocal range that encompasses the high notes of a soprano and the low notes of a mezzo soprano a voice teacher would therefore look to see whether or not the singer was more comfortable singing up higher or singing lower if the singer was more comfortable singing higher then the teacher would probably classify them as a soprano and if the singer was more comfortable singing lower than they would probably classify them as a mezzo soprano the teacher would also listen to the sound of the voice sopranos tend to have a lighter and less rich vocal sound than a mezzo soprano a voice teacher however would never classify a singer in more than one voice type regardless of the size of their vocal range the following are the general vocal ranges associated with each voice type using scientific pitch notation where middle c c4 some singers within these voice types may be able to sing somewhat higher or lower in terms of frequency human voices are roughly in the range of 80 hz to 1100 hz for normal male and female voices together 








































































 this chart only displays to a c0 though the octocontrabass clarinet extends down the b below that c the world records for high and low pitch extend well outside of this range and extend outside the range of human hearing as noted above claims of exceptionally wide vocal ranges are not uncommon among some singers  charles kellogg who claimed to have a vocal range of 12 5 octaves could accurately imitate birdcalls which sometimes went up into the ultrasonic range according to kellogg his calls could go as high as 14 000 hz some recordings of kellogg s birdcalls still exist however kellogg s claims are very hard to verify nicola sedda hit an a9 broke adam lopez s record for highest vocal note and claims to have a vocal range spanning 8 5 octaves but has not been recognized by the guinness book of records yet in late 2006 edward morgan hit an e8 showing his range of 7 octaves from e1 e8 breaking adam lopez s previous record which has yet to be verified by the guinness book of records it is claimed that the sound clip was verified by j m lindeijer of the dutch divas opera site in 2006 the guinness book of records published several categories relating to extremes of human vocal range it stated the following femalesmales
emusic is an online music store that operates by subscription it is headquartered in new york city and owned by dimensional associates llc as of september 2008 emusic has over 400 000 subscribers emusic differs from other well known subscription music services in that the files available for download are in the mp3 format making them fully compatible with all digital music players and free from digital rights management software restrictions such as expiration dates or copying or cd burning limitations while lauded by the general public the lack of digital rights management encoding and low price model have made the service unappealing to the big four record labels leading it to specialize in underground artists and non mainstream music genres including indie rock pop jazz electronica new age underground rap traditional music classical music hardcore punk and experimental music all on independent labels due to the contentious nature of drm encoding utilized by competing download services emusic has won praise for not including any in their own files despite the fact that it has cost them contracts with the major record labels they have openly stated that this is a business move that has greatly aided the site s popularity as apple does not currently license fairplay the drm format compatible with their popular ipod player used in files downloaded from their itunes music store doing away with such protections is the only means for a competing company to offer ipod compatible downloads emusic stores a record of user purchases on its internal servers but does not place any purchaser information inside the tracks that are sold the record labels working with emusic don t worry about file sharing of their music because emusic users tend to be older and less likely to engage in file sharing the type of college students who tend to participate in file sharing either couldn t or wouldn t pay for music online so emusic is more targeted at avid music fans gene rumsey general manager of concord music group says emusic fans are not the typical college age file sharers they are more rabid fans who he believes are less likely to engage in online song swapping serious music fans would also appreciate that musicians are actually paid for every download the emusic service uses the lame mp3 encoder to produce variable bit rate mp3 files analysis on the files show that the preset used is alt preset standard a high quality vbr preset aiming at an average bit rate around 192kbit s emusic caters to an older audience with the average subscriber being 39 who subscribes for at least a year emusic had 4 500 000 tracks available for download and sold over 250 000 000 tracks as of november 2008 new subscribers receive 25 free downloads during their first month of subscription the trial account turns into a billable subscription account immediately after registering for a trial refunds are possible under certain circumstances by contacting emusic customer support subscriptions allow users to download a number of tracks per 30 day period as of september 2008 a basic package allows for 30 downloads with plus premium and connoisseur subscriptions offering more downloads per month at higher prices and lower price per download every 30 days the download limit is reset emusic also offers booster packs to subscribers which expire after 90 days rather than after a month and are consumed when subscribers download tracks beyond their monthly allotments earlier business models supported an all you can eat downloading pattern for a monthly fee customers were able to download as many tracks as they wished from the service as the old emusic messageboard once documented emusic regularly disciplined customers including canceling their contracts who downloaded more tracks than emusic thought reasonable within the all you can eat framework there have been a number of complaints at various places on the web about emusic s service these complaints range from claims that they still charge customers after they have deleted their accounts to claims that the terms of emusic s terms of service obligate customers to subscribe for a year another complaint that has become more common is that emusic by virtue of their privacy policy may pass subscriber information on to other companies or individuals who in turn send spam e mails to the particular emusic customer most of emusic s contracts are with independent labels giving the service a reputation for primarily offering indie rock indie pop punk rock jazz and classical music emusic highlights its offerings through a host of exclusive editorial content along the lines of monthly editor s picks columns and guides the company also cites statistics from the american association of independent music that independents market share of cd sales is 28 with the big four record labels unwilling to do business with the site many popular artists are either unrepresented or have very few releases available this is more of a problem in the genres of top 40 rock and rap music and less so in genres such as jazz where major artists spread their output across multiple smaller labels this allows the site to feature some acclaimed recordings by artists such as thelonious monk sonny rollins miles davis and john coltrane the site also carries the complete classical catalog of naxos records the site s alternative rock selection has also been aided by the rise in widely distributed but privately owned minor labels such as kill rock stars and matador records who have a fair amount of big name talent on their rolls music from other popular indie labels includes merge records k records touch and go records and tvt records in 1999 emusic made headlines by releasing one of the first internet only albums by a major artist long tall weekend by they might be giants the band would also go on to release a series of monthly exclusive rarities collections through the service in 2001 and 2002 john flansburgh said that getting a half dozen or dozen unreleased songs out each month provides an ultimate fan club experience in 2004 with the change from an unlimited download subscription model to a set track subscription download emusic significantly increased their catalogue content over the next few years particularly in the indian soundtrack and indian classical genres and in the classical music genre adding labels like saregama naxos bis chandos harmonia mundi telarc and many others in june 2006 emusic added new music from v2 records in the u s the label is one of emusic s highest profile additions thus far with multiplatinum acts moby and the white stripes along with critical favorites such as grandaddy however this music is not available to emusic users in many other countries on august 10 2006 emusic added two european versions of its online store emusic uk and emusic europe current subscribers to the global site that were within the european union had their membership transferred to the appropriate european store emusic uk and emusic europe have markedly inflated prices compared to their north american counterpart partially due to the extra sales taxes which these stores are now subject to which was particularly noted by customers forced to transfer however the changeover also included access to labels not available to non european customers notably london based domino records the changeover also includes many works previously unavailable to european customers such as music from the white stripes and mogwai however some artists previously available such as vienna teng became unavailable to uk subscribers even if they had purchased them previously it is also notable that the european version of the store is for customers within the european union not customers within europe in june 2007 emusic added perhaps its biggest star yet to its lineup paul mccartney of the beatles his album memory almost full is also the first release on starbucks hear music label the emusiclive venue network is 22 independent clubs in the us where live shows are recorded and offered to emusic subscribers numerous shows are recorded every week in

flash drives beginning september 18 2007 emusic began offering audiobooks in mp3 format on april 2 2008 emusic added the rolling stones when they were on their abkco label this includes their music from 1964 1970 plus any compilations made thereafter by abkco the availability of the rolling stones catalog ended on may 3 2008 the original emusic was started in march 1995 by mark chasan as the fourth online cd retailer emusic and nordic music formed a joint venture in february 1998 to become the first digital media retailer and sold the first mp3 players on the internet emusic then headed by chasan and kiefer purchased guy giuliano s internet radio service gbs radio networks the new consortium launched the first online radio network loudradio to broadcast over a terrestrial radio

rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music and emerged in the early 1950s the term rockabilly is a portmanteau of rock and hillbilly the latter a reference to the country music that contributed strongly to the style s development other important influences on rockabilly include western swing boogie woogie and rhythm and blues although there are notable exceptions its origins lie primarily in the southern united states the influence and popularity of the style waned in the 1960s but during the late 1970s and early 1980s rockabilly enjoyed a major revival of popularity that has endured to the present often within a rockabilly subculture there was a close relationship between the blues and country music from the very earliest country recordings in the 1920s the first nationwide country hit was wreck of the old 97 backed with lonesome road blues which also became very popular jimmie rodgers the first true country star was known as the blue yodeler and most of his songs used blues based chord progressions although with very different instrumentation and sound than the recordings of his black contemporaries like blind lemon jefferson and bessie smith during the 1930s and 1940s two new sounds emerged bob wills and his texas playboys were the leading proponents of western swing which combined country singing and steel guitar with big band jazz influences and horn sections wills music found massive popularity recordings of wills from the mid 40s to the early 50s include two beat jazz rhythms jazz choruses and guitar work that preceded early rockabilly recordings wills is quoted as saying rock and roll why man that s the same kind of music we ve been playin since 1928 but it s just basic rhythm and has gone by a lot of different names in my time it s the same whether you just follow a drum beat like in africa or surround it with a lot of instruments the rhythm s what s important after blues artists like meade lux lewis and pete johnson launched a nationwide boogie craze starting in 1938 country artists like moon mullican the delmore brothers tennessee ernie ford speedy west jimmy bryant and the maddox brothers and rose began recording what was known as hillbilly boogie which consisted of hillbilly vocals and instrumentation with a boogie bass line the maddox brothers and rose were at the leading edge of rockabilly with the slapped bass that fred maddox had developed maddox said you ve got to have somethin they can tap their foot or dance to or to make em feel it after wwii the band shifted into higher gear leaning more toward a whimsical honky tonk feel with a heavy manic bottom end the slap bass of fred maddox they played hillbilly music but it sounded real hot they played real loud for that time too  the maddoxes were also known for their lively antics and stuff we always put on a show i mean it just wasn t us up there pickin and singing there was something going on all the time  the demonstrative maddoxes helped release white bodies from traditional motions of decorum more and more younger white artists began to behave on stage like the lively maddoxes  others believe that they were not only at the leading edge but were one of the first if not the first rockabilly group emmylou harris believes that performers such as rose maddox have never received the recognition they deserve she says part of this is due to what she calls a reluctance in american society to celebrate the value of white country and roots music zeb turner s february 1953 recording of jersey rock with its mix of musical styles lyrics about music and dancing and guitar solo is another example of the mixing of musical genres in the first half of the 1950s bill monroe is known as the father of bluegrass a specific style of country music many of his songs were in blues form while others took the form of folk ballads parlor songs or waltzes bluegrass was a staple of country music in the early 1950s and is often mentioned as an influence in the development of rockablly the honky tonk sound which tended to focus on working class life with frequently tragic themes of lost love adultery loneliness alcoholism and self pity also included songs of energetic uptempo hillbilly boogie some of the better known musicians who recorded and performed these songs are the delmore brothers the maddox brothers and rose merle travis hank williams hank snow and tennessee ernie ford curtis gordon s 1953 rompin and stompin  an uptempo hillbilly boogie included the lyrics way down south where i was born they rocked all night til early morn they start rockin they start rockin an rollin sharecroppers sons carl perkins and his brothers jay perkins and clayton perkins along with drummer w s holland had been playing their music roughly ninety miles from memphis the perkins brothers band featuring both carl and jay on lead vocals quickly established themselves as the hottest band on the cutthroat get hot or go home jackson tn honky tonk circuit most of the requests for songs were for hillbilly songs that were delivered as jived up versions classic hank williams standards infused with a faster rhythm it was here that carl started composing his first songs with an eye toward the future watching the dance floor at all times for a reaction working out a more rhythmically driving style of music that was neither country nor blues but had elements of both perkins kept reshaping these loosely structured songs until he had a completed composition which would then be finally put to paper carl was already sending demos to new york record companies who kept rejecting him sometimes explaining that this strange new style of country with a pronounced rhythm fit no current commercial trend that would change in 1954 in the early 1950s there was heavy competition among memphis area bands playing an audience savvy mix of covers original songs and hillbilly flavored blues one source mentions both local disc jocky dewey phillips and sam phillips as being influential scotty moore remembers that you could play as long as you could play say the top eight or ten songs from country pop r b they didn t care what instruments you had as long as people could dance the saturday night jamboree was a local stage show held every saturday night at the goodwyn institute auditorium in downtown memphis tennessee in 1953 54 but of more historical significance was something that was going on backstage in the dressing rooms every saturday night in 1953 the dressing rooms backstage were a gathering place where musicians would come together and experiment with new sounds mixing fast country gospel blues and boogie woogie guys were bringing in new licks that they had developed and were teaching them to other musicians and were learning new licks from yet other musicians backstage soon these new sounds began to make their way out onto the stage of the jamboree where they found a very receptive audience younger musicians around memphis tennessee were beginning to play a mix of musical styles paul burlison for one was playing in nondescript hillbilly bands in the very early 1950s one of these early groups secured a fifteen minute show on radio station kwem in west memphis arkansas the time slot was adjacent to howlin wolf s and the music quickly became a curious blend of blues country and what would become known as rockabilly music in 1951 and 1952 the burnettes and burlison played around memphis and established a reputation for wild music they played with doc mcqueen s swing band at the hideaway club but hated the type of music played by chart musicians soon they broke away and began playing their energetic brand of rockabilly to small but appreciative local audiences they wrote rock billy boogie while working at the hideaway unfortunately for the burnettes and burlison they didn t record the song until 1957 in 1953 at the tender age of 13 janis martin was developing her own proto rockabilly style on wrva s old dominion barn dance which broadcast out of richmond va although martin performed mostly country songs for the show she also did songs by rhythm and blues singers ruth brown and lavern baker as well as a few dinah washington songs the audience didn t know what to make of it they didn t hardly allow electric instruments and i was doing some songs by black artists stuff like ruth brown s mama he treats your daughter mean in an interview that can be viewed at the experience music project barbara pittman states that it was so new and it was so easy it was a three chord change rockabilly was actually an insult to the southern rockers at that time over the years it has picked up a little dignity it was their way of calling us hillbillies although the term was in common use even before the burnettes wrote rock billy boogie one of the first written uses of the term rockabilly was in a june 23 1956 billboard review of ruckus tyler s rock town rock the first record to contain the word rockabilly in a song title was issued in november of 1956 rock a billy gal in 1951 a western swing bandleader named bill haley recorded a version of rocket 88 with his group the saddlemen considered one of the earliest recognized rockabilly recordings it was followed by versions of rock the joint in 1952 and original works such as real rock drive and crazy man crazy the latter of which reached 12 on the american billboard chart in 1953 on april 12 1954 haley with his band recorded rock around the clock for decca records of new york city when first released in may of 1954 rock around the clock made the charts for one week at number 23 and sold 75 000 copies a year later it was featured in the film blackboard jungle and soon afterwards it was topping charts all over the world and opening up a new genre of entertainment rock around the clock hit no 1 held that position for eight weeks and was the 2 song on the billboard hot 100 chart for 1955 the recording was until the late 1990s recognized by guinness world records as having the highest sales claim for a pop vinyl recording with an unaudited claim of 25 million copies sold rock n roll an expansive term coined a couple years earlier by dj alan freed had now been to the pop mountaintop a position it would never quite relinquish maine native and connecticut resident bill flagg began using the term rockbilly for his combination of rock n roll and hillbilly music as early as 1953 he cut several songs for tetra records in 1956 and 1957 go cat go went into the national billboard charts in 1956 and his guitar rock is cited as classic rockabilly sun records was a small independent label run by sam phillips in memphis tennessee for several years phillips had been recording and releasing performances by blues and country musicians in the area he also ran a service allowing anyone to come in off the street and for 3 98 record himself on a two song vanity record one young man who came to record himself as a surprise for his mother he claimed was elvis presley according to phillips ninety five percent of the people i had been working with were black most of them of course no name people elvis fit right in he was born and raised in poverty he was around people that had very little in the way of worldly goods presley made enough of an impression that phillips deputized guitarist scotty moore who then enlisted bassist bill black both from the starlight wranglers a local western swing band to work with the green young elvis the trio rehearsed dozens of songs from traditional country to harbor lights a hit for crooner bing crosby to gospel during a break on july 5 1954 elvis jumped up  and started frailin guitar and singin that s all right mama scotty and bill began playing along excited phillips told them to back up and start from the beginning two or three takes later phillips had a satisfactory recording and released that s all right on july 19 1954 along with an elvis presley scotty and bill version of bill monroe s waltz blue moon of kentucky a country standard presley s sun recordings feature his vocals and rhythm guitar bill black s percussive slapped bass and scotty moore on an amplified guitar slap bass had been a staple of both western swing and hillbilly boogie since the 1940s commenting on his own guitar playing scotty moore said all i can tell you is i just stole from every guitar player i heard over the years put it in my data bank an when i played that s just what come out but what really sets this recording apart is elvis s vocal which soars across a wide range and expresses both a youthful humor and a boundless confidence the overall feeling the song communicates is one of limitless freedom although some state that the sound of that s all right was entirely new others are of the opinion that it wasn t that they said i never heard anything like it before it wasn t as if this started a revolution it galvanized a revolution not because elvis had expressed something new but he expressed something they had all been trying to express when that s all right was played on memphis radio listeners called to ask about the song nevertheless from august 18 1954 through december 8 1954 blue moon of kentucky was consistently charted at a higher position nobody was sure what to call this music so elvis was described as the hillbilly cat and king of western bop over the next year elvis would record four more singles for sun together the upbeat numbers can be used as a touchstone for the rockabilly style nervously up tempo with slap bass fancy guitar picking lots of echo shouts of encouragement and vocals full of histrionics such as hiccups stutters and swoops from falsetto to bass and back again by the end of 1954 elvis asked d j fontana who was the underutilized drummer for the louisiana hayride would you go with us if we got any more dates presley was now using drums as did many other rockabilly performers drums were then uncommon in country music each of presley s sun singles combined a blues song on one side with a country song on the other but both sung in the same vein in the 1955 sessions shortly after presley s move from sun records to rca presley was backed by a band that included moore black fontana lap steel guitarist jimmy day and pianist floyd cramer in 1956 elvis acquired vocal backup via the jordanaires the 1957 recording of jailhouse rock for the film of the same name clearly features piano and saxophone in 1954 both johnny cash and carl perkins auditioned for sam phillips cash hoped to record gospel music but phillips immediately nixed that idea cash did not return until 1955 in october 1955 carl perkins and the perkins brothers band showed up at the sun studios phillips recorded perkins original song movie magg which was released early march 1955 on phillip s flip label which was all country presley s second and third records were not as successful as the first the fourth release in may 1955 baby let s play house peaked at 5 on the national billboard country chart the sun label lists gunter as the song writer a song which he recorded it in 1954 however in 1951 eddy arnold recorded a song titled i want to play house with you by cy coben lyrics for the two songs are nearly identical cash returned to sun in 1955 with his song hey porter and his group the tennessee three who became the tennessee two before the session was over this song and another cash original cry cry cry were released in july cry cry cry managed to crack billboard s top 20 peaking at no 14 in august sun released elvis versions of i forgot to remember to forget and mystery train forgot written by sun country artists stan kesler and charlie feathers spent a total of 39 weeks on the billboard country chart with five of the those weeks at the 1 spot mystery train with writing credits for both herman little junior parker and sam phillips peaked at 11 through most of 1955 cash perkins presley and other louisiana hayride performers toured through texas arkansas louisiana and mississippi sun released two more perkins songs in october gone gone gone and let the jukebox keep on playing scotty moore commented on the different roles of elvis and perkins carl was a nice looking big hunk like out in the cornfield type elvis was more like an adonis but as a rockabilly carl was the king of that 1955 was also the year in which chuck berry s hillbilly influenced maybellene reached high in the charts as a crossover hit and bill haley and his comets rock around the clock was not only 1 for 8 weeks but was the 2 record for the year rock n roll in general and rockabilly in particular was at critical mass and the next year elvis presley s heartbreak hotel and don t be cruel would also top the billboard charts as well slapback slapback echo flutter echo tape delay echo echo and reverb are some of the terms used to describe one particular aspect of rockabilly recordings the distinctive reverberation on the early hit records such as rock around the clock by bill haley his comets was created by recording the band under the domed ceiling of decca s studio in new york located in a former ballroom called the pythian temple it was a big barn like building with great echo this same facility would also be used to record other rockabilly musicians such as buddy holly and the rock and roll trio in memphis sam phillips used various techniques to create similar acoustics at his memphis recording services studio the shape of the ceiling corrugated tiles and the setup of the studio were augmented by slap back tape echo which involved feeding the original signal from one tape machine through a second machine the echo effect had been used less subtly on wilf carter victor records of the 1930s and in eddy arnold s 1945 cattle call in more technical terms it was a tape delay and a 7 1 2 ips instead of the more advance 15 ips according to cowboy jack clement who took over production duties from sam phillips there s two heads one records and one plays back the sound comes along and it s recorded on this head and a split second later it goes to the playback head but you can take that and loop it to where it plays a split second after it was recorded and it flips right back into the record head or you can have a separate machine and do that if you do it on one machine you have to echo everything in more technical terms a tape delay and a 7 1 2 ips instead of the more advance 15 ips the recordings were thus an idealized representation of the customary live sound when elvis presley left phillips sun records and recorded heartbreak hotel for rca the rca producers placed microphones at the end of a hallway to achieve a similar effect in january 1956 three new classic songs by cash perkins and presley were released folsom prison blues by cash and blue suede shoes by perkins both on sun and heartbreak hotel by presley on rca other rockabilly tunes released this month included see you later alligator by roy hall and whole lotta shakin goin on by the commodores perkins blue suede shoes sold 20 000 records a day at one point and it was the first million selling country song to cross over to both rhythm and blues and pop charts on february 11 presley appeared on the dorsey brothers stage show for the third time singing blue suede shoes and heartbreak hotel he performed blue suede shoes two more times on national television and heartbreak hotel three times throughout 1956 both songs topped the

records tommy sleepy labeef recorded rockabilly tunes on a number of labels from 1957 through 1963 rockabilly pioneers the maddox brothers and rose both as a group and with rose as a solo act added onto their two decades of performing by making records that were even more rocking however none of these artists had any major hits and their influence would not be felt until decades later when artists like becky hobbs rosie flores and kim lenz would join the rockabilly revival rockabilly music enjoyed great popularity in the united states during 1956 and 1957 but radio play declined after 1960 factors contributing to this decline are usually cited as the 1959 death of buddy holly along with ritchie valens and the big bopper the induction of elvis presley into the army in 1958 and a general change in american musical tastes the style remained popular longer in england where it attracted a fanatical following right up through the mid 1960s rockabilly music cultivated an attitude that assured its enduring appeal to teenagers this was a combination of rebellion sexuality and freedom a sneering expression of disdain for the workaday world of parents and authority figures it was the first rock n roll style to be performed primarily by white musicians thus setting off a cultural revolution that is still reverberating today the first wave of rockabilly fans in britain were called teddy boys because they wore long edwardian style frock coats along with tight black drainpipe trousers and brothel creeper shoes by the early 1960s they had metamorphosed into the rockers and had adopted the classic greaser look of t shirts jeans and leather jackets to go with their heavily slicked pompadour haircuts the rockers loved 1950s rock and roll artists such as gene vincent and some british rockabilly fans formed bands and played their own version of the music the most notable of these bands was the beatles when john lennon first met paul mccartney he was impressed that mccartney knew all the chords and the words to eddie cochran s twenty flight rock as the band became more professional and began playing in hamburg they took on the beatle name and they adopted the black leather look of gene vincent musically they combined holly s melodic pop sensibility with the rough and rocking sounds of vincent and carl perkins when the beatles became worldwide stars they released versions of three different carl perkins songs more than any other songwriter outside the band long after the band broke up the members continued to show their interest in rockabilly in 1975 lennon recorded an album called rock n roll featuring versions of rockabilly hits and a cover photo showing him in full gene vincent leather about the same time ringo starr had a hit with a version of johnny burnette s you re sixteen in the 1980s mccartney recorded a duet with carl perkins and george harrison played with roy orbison in the traveling wilburys in 1999 mccartney released run devil run his own record of rockabilly covers the beatles were not the only british invasion artists influenced by rockabilly the rolling stones recorded buddy holly s not fade away on an early single the who despite being mod favourites covered eddie cochran s summertime blues on their live at leeds album even heavy guitar heroes such as jeff beck and jimmy page were influenced by rockabilly musicians beck recorded his own tribute album to gene vincent s guitarist cliff gallup crazy legs and page s band led zeppelin offered to work as elvis presley s backing band in the 1970s however presley never took them up on that offer years later led zeppelin s page and robert plant recorded a tribute to the music of the 1950s called the honeydrippers volume one by 1968 the british invasion had largely chased the older american rock artists off the charts most of the 1950s rockabilly performers who were still alive such as jerry lee lewis and carl perkins had taken refuge in country music in december 1968 elvis appeared on an nbc tv special clad in black leather he sang his heart out proving not only that he could rock but that he had far more emotional depth to share than he had 10 years earlier the so called comeback special created tremendous excitement among the record buying public and elvis s newer harder hitting songs soon began enjoying major chart success songs like suspicious minds promised land and burning love were all cut from presley s classic mold and they enjoyed huge international sales the king returned to live performances setting attendance records across the usa in the wake of elvis s return a renewed interest developed in 1950s music a young band from san francisco creedence clearwater revival became one of the best selling rock groups of the era playing old rockabilly songs and new songs written in the same style don mclean had a giant hit with american pie a song about the death of buddy holly then in 1973 george lucas released his film american graffiti this movie and its chart topping oldies soundtrack launched a major 1970s industry of 50s nostalgia soon tv had its own version of graffiti in happy days artists like sha na na gained fame playing 1950s rock as a cartoon joke and many original artists began playing oldies shows linda ronstadt enjoyed a major string of hit singles with soft rock covers of songs by buddy holly roy orbison and the everly brothers although none of these captured the fire and excitement of 1950s rockabilly they did create curiosity about the real music of that era elvis s death in 1977 inspired an unprecedented outpouring of news coverage radio tributes books and documentaries presley s records were all over the radio for months and efforts to document the early history of rock n roll began to reach a mass audience although there was an unfortunate explosion in the number of cheesy elvis impersonator stage acts over time all of the hoopla drew attention to the original music too two films released in the late 1970s really did capture the excitement of the music even though they confused several facts the buddy holly story was a biopic starring the magnetic gary busey who seemed possessed by holly s spirit even though nearly all of holly s friends and relatives denounced the screenplay s cavalier way with the truth american hot wax a film bio of dj alan freed was even more creative with the details of history but concluded with a barn burning concert sequence featuring jerry lee lewis and chuck berry proving they still had all the moxie and charisma that made them rock gods in the 50s this was exciting but was just the prelude to even bigger things in the early 1970s some young listeners began perceiving the chart dominating light rock and disco to be excessively commercialized and there was a sense among some listeners that the art rock and progressive rock bands had become pretentious and bloated these listeners wanted to return to the simple loud fast emotionally direct music of early rock and roll some musicians stripped their sound down to three chords loud guitars and shouted lyrics creating early punk rock other musicians turned back to the original rock and roll music of the 1950s for inspiration and in the late 1970s an underground rockabilly revival began to emerge by the early 1980s a few bands such as the stray cats had mainstream chart success in england in the early 1970s there was a teddy boy rocker scene teddy boys listened to bands such as crazy cavan rockers listened to 1950 s rock n roll in the early 1970s levi dexter was a teddy boy in london england he was on the teddy boy circuit for years learning to sing while jamming with teddy boy bands at clubs like the black raven levi dexter was soon discovered in england by david bowie s former manager lee childers while singing a song with shakin stevens within months levi dexter the rockats were formed they played on live tv shows such as the merv griffin show wolfman jack s levi dexter has been called the james brown of rockabilly levi dexter brought energy to rockabilly the early la punk scene no one had ever seen before best describe as desperate sweaty urgent neo rockabilly after appearing on the tv shows in 1977 they appeared on the louisiana hayride toured america they recorded note from the south room to rock many other great songs played on kroq fm radio in los angeles levi went on to record more records still recording to this day rock and roll singer robert gordon who was formerly the vocalist for new york punk band the tuff darts went solo and began performing old rockabilly songs in 1977 unlike sha na na or the elvis impersonators gordon was not presenting the music as a joke but trying to recapture the wild energy and excitement of the 1950s performers he teamed with guitarist link wray and recorded an album that year spawning a minor hit single with a cover of billy lee riley s red hot gordon also covered the 1958 gene summers recording of nervous on his bad boy album issued in 1979 on rca records he also toured with guitarist danny gatton one of their gigs was released as the humbler a searing re creation of rockabilly hits and obscurities four more albums followed by 1981 with another minor pop hit and two low level country chart hits gordon toured around the country and his dedication and energy inspired many listeners and musicians to begin to explore rockabilly music the diversions were a washington d c band in the early 1980s influenced by early rock and roll and rockabilly and had regional success as did tex rubinowitz and the bad boys who were also from washington d c the scene in washington had many rockabilly bands during the early 1980s danny gatton had much success playing rockabilly and rock and roll johnny seaton from dc was an elvis impersonator and later a rockabilly link wray had spent a lot of time in washington d c and robert gordon had come from dc before moving to nyc by the late 80 s the rockabilly scene in washington had faded into obscurity dave edmunds joined up with songwriter nick lowe to form a band called rockpile in 1975 they had a string of minor rockabilly style hits like i knew the bride the group became a popular touring act in britain and the us leading to respectable album sales edmunds also nurtured and produced many younger artists who shared his love of rockabilly most notably the stray cats shakin stevens was a welsh singer who gained fame in the uk portraying elvis in a stage play in 1980 he took a cover of the blasters marie marie into the uk top 20 his hopped up versions of songs like this ole house and green door were giant sellers across europe shakin stevens was the number two bestselling singles artist of the 1980s in europe outstripping michael jackson prince and bruce springsteen despite his popularity in europe he never became popular in the us in 2005 his greatest hits album topped the charts in england the cramps rose out of the punk scene at the new york club cbgb combining primitive and wild rockabilly sounds with lyrics inspired by old drive in horror movies in songs like human fly and i was a teenage werewolf lead singer lux interior s energetic and unpredictable live shows attracted a fervent cult audience their psychobilly music influenced the meteors and reverend horton heat queen paid homage to the style with crazy little thing called love in 1979 the last rockabilly song to hit 1st in the billboard hot 100 the stray cats were the most commercially successful of the new rockabilly artists the band formed on long island in 1979 when brian setzer teamed up with two school chums calling themselves lee rocker and slim jim phantom the trio fully adopted the gene vincent look complete with flashy pompadour haircuts leather jackets and tattoos aplenty attracting little attention in new york they flew to london in 1980 where they had heard that there was an active rockabilly scene early shows were attended by the rolling stones and dave edmunds who quickly ushered the boys into a recording studio in short order the stray cats had three uk top ten singles to their credit and two bestselling albums they returned to the usa performing on the tv show fridays with a message flashing across the screen that they had no record deal in the states soon emi picked them up their first videos appeared on mtv and they stormed up the charts stateside their third lp rant n rave with the stray cats topped charts across the usa and europe as they sold out shows everywhere during 1983 however personal conflicts led the band to break up at the height of their popularity brian setzer went on to solo success working in both rockabilly and swing styles while rocker and phantom continued to record in bands both together and singly the group has reconvened several times to make new records or tours and continue to attract large audiences live although record sales have never again approached their early eighties success the blasters were centered around brothers phil and dave alvin the brothers and their musical friends had grown up in a country town called downey outside los angeles and had spent their teens playing with such legendary r b musicians as big joe turner willie dixon jimmy reed s former bandleader marcus johnson and lee allen the sax player on the hits of fats domino and little richard having learned american roots music from the masters the band began playing around la in the late 1970s attracting a following for their combination of classic styles punk energy and dave alvin s powerful songs several albums on the warner brothers distributed label slash and appearances in movies failed to land a chart hit although sales were respectable and the band captured a strong cult following among fans and critics even inspiring fan john cougar mellencamp to write and produce a single for the band in the late 1980s dave alvin left the band to begin a successful solo career and phil went back to ucla to get his doctorate in mathematics today phil tours with a new blasters lineup and the original members occasionally gather for performances jason the scorchers combined heavy metal chuck berry and hank williams into a punk powered blender creating a truly modern style of rockabilly although many would slap them with another label such as alt country or cowpunk jason the scorchers did what elvis and the others had done in the 1950s they combined the rockingest current urban sounds with the most backwoods country to create a new sound that had more edge than either of its sources although they were critics darlings and drew a rabid fan base from coast to coast the scorchers never managed to have the big hit record their label demanded today their works are nearly all out of print although they periodically reappear for new tours many other bands were associated with the rockabilly bandwagon in the early 1980s including the rockats danny dean and the homewreckers the shakin pyramids the polecats zantees the kingbees leroi brothers the nervous fellas lone justice and chris isaak closely related was the roots rock movement which continued through the 1980s led by artists like james intveld who later toured as lead guitar for the blasters the beat farmers the paladins del lords long ryders the fabulous thunderbirds los lobos the fleshtones del fuegos and barrence whitfield and the savages these bands like the blasters were inspired by a full range of historic american styles blues country rockabilly r b and new orleans jazz they held a strong appeal for listeners who were tired of the commercially oriented mtv style technopop and glam metal bands that dominated radio play during this time period but none of these musicians became major stars also related but much more successful were the artists who rose to fame in the wake of bruce springsteen springsteen first achieved pop chart success with born to run in 1975 and had always been strongly influenced by earlier styles notably rockabilly sixties girl groups and garage bands and soul music although he was a hugely popular performer throughout the 1970s his 1984 lp born in the usa brought him overwhelming success not only did the supporting tour set attendance records but springsteen s songs became ubiquitous on radio and mtv the album spawned a slew of hit singles and several other veteran performers with similar roots oriented sounds and socially conscious lyrics enjoyed renewed popularity during the mid 1980s bob seger john cougar mellencamp john cafferty and the beaver brown band and creedence clearwater revival s former leader john fogerty who scored a chart topping triumph with his solo album centerfield in 1985 in 1983 country rock singer neil young recorded a rockabilly album titled everybody s rockin the album was not a commercial success and young was involved in a widely publicized legal fight with geffen records who sued him for making a record that didn t sound like a neil young record young made no further albums in the rockabilly style finally during the 1980s a number of country music stars scored hits recording in a rockabilly style marty stuart s hillbilly rock and hank williams jr s all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight were the most noteworthy examples of this trend but they and other artists like steve earle and the kentucky headhunters charted many records with this approach although these styles of music were overshadowed after 1990 by the rise of grunge and rap they left behind a sizable cult audience that continued to support rockabilly and roots influenced performers through the 1990s and into the present adam ant s goody two shoes employs a rockabilly style rockabilly has joined the ranks of established musical subcultures in the united states as with other established music genres such as jazz blues bluegrass and punk rock a small core of rockabilly musicians are able to earn a steady but limited income primarily by touring and playing at festivals specialist venues and recording for independent record labels like the other subcultures the rockabilly scene supports musicians and their performances using fanzines websites and chat pages although no other rockabilly performers have risen to the level of mass popularity enjoyed by the stray cats in the 1980s the scene has grown in the 2000s there has been a significant overlap with and interaction between the rockabilly scene and swing revival brian setzer helped to join these two subcultures in that he was both a rockabilly band leader and a swing band leader other artists such as tom catmul and the clerics trick pony danny dean and the homewreckers the reverend horton heat rattled roosters and royal crown revue were also popular among both camps additionally the cherry poppin daddies a multi genre rock band who found their biggest success in the swing revival scene had recorded a number of rockabilly and country tunes on their studio albums there are active rockabilly scenes in many major us cities particularly on the west coast as well as major festivals such as viva las vegas and hootenanny and the heavy rebel weekend festival on the east coast rockabilly fans have made common cause with hot rod vintage car enthusiasts and many festivals feature both music and vintage cars with a 1950s flavor with the growth of satellite and internet radio there are regular broadcast outlets for rockabilly music the not for profit rockabilly hall of fame was created march 21 1997 to remember the early rockabilly music and to promote those who want to continue rockabilly music popularity and accessibility into the future in europe rockabilly remains a vibrant and active subculture with strong interest not only in current revivalist musicians but also in performances and recordings by surviving artists from the 1950s along with the revival of 1950s style rockabilly music several rockabilly disc jockeys have arisen around the world a significant reason for the continuing phenomenon of new generations discovering and embracing rockabilly is their dissatisfaction with mainstream culture music and stylistic icons rockabilly often becomes a way of life or lifestyle to those involved who consider the larger group to be a brotherhood the rockabilly lifestyle is not confined to just the music but also the home furnishings cars and even small things like the cigarettes smoked the rockabilly culture is an antithesis to current trends as it embraces its roots in old school societal fringes concentrated in countries like usa australia new zealand uk and also in the rest of europe the rockabilly hall of fame was established on march 21 1997 to present early rock and roll

a gramophone record is an analog sound storage medium consisting of a flat disc with an inscribed modulated spiral groove usually starting near the periphery and ending near the centre of the disc when made of polyvinyl chloride they are also known as vinyl records gramophone records were the primary medium used for commercial music reproduction for most of the 20th century they replaced the phonograph cylinder as the most popular recording medium in the 1900s and although they were supplanted in popularity in the late 1980s by digital media leaving mainstream by 1991 they continue to be manufactured and sold as of 2009 still used by djs and audiophiles for certain types of music especially electronic dance music hip hop punk rock and jazz as recording technology evolved more specific terms for various types of phonograph records were used in order to describe some aspect of the record either its correct rotational speed or the material used other terms such as long play or l p and extended play or e p were coined to describe multi song records which were capable of playing for far longer than the single song per side records which typically didn t go much past 4 minutes per side an l p can play for about thirty minutes per side the 45 normally contained one song per side but as an ep could achieve recording times of 10 to 15 minutes at the expense of attenuating and compressing the sound to reduce the width required by the groove ep discs were generally used to make available songs not on singles including songs on lps albums in a smaller less expensive format for those who had only 45 rpm players the large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms in modern times it is common for a band to release an ep of 4 or 5 songs to build buzz before the full album or lp is released the use of the term album no longer has any relation to the physical format but rather the length of the album and the number of songs sizes of records in america and the uk are generally measured in inches usually represented with a double prime symbol e g a 7 inch or 7 record 45s are generally 7 records lps were 10 records at first but soon the 12 size became by far the most common with 78s generally being 10 but also 12 and 7 and even smaller the so called little wonders a device utilizing a vibrating pen to graphically represent sound on discs of paper without the idea of playing it back in any manner was built by edouard leon scott of france in 1857 while the mechanism known as a phonautograph was intended solely to depict the visual characteristics of sound it was recently realized that this depiction could be digitally analyzed and reconstructed as an audible recording just such an early phonoautogram made in 1860 and now the earliest known audio recording has been reproduced using computer technology in 1877 thomas edison developed the phonautograph into a machine the phonograph that was capable of replaying the recordings made the recordings were made on tinfoil and were initially intending to be used as a voice recording medium typically for office dictation this initial machine was developed further by edward guilliard though his developments were subsequently incorporated into edison s patent something that he had to fight for the next 26 years this phonograph cylinder dominated the recorded sound market beginning in the 1880s lateral cut disc records were invented by emile berliner in 1888 and were used exclusively in toys until 1894 when berliner began marketing disc records under the berliner gramophone label the edison blue amberol record was introduced in 1912 with a longer playing time of around 4 minutes and a more resilient playing surface than its wax predecessor but the format was doomed due to the difficulty of reproducing recordings by november 1918 the patents for the manufacture of lateral cut disc records expired opening the field for countless companies to produce them causing disc records to overtake cylinders in popularity production of amberol cylinders ceased in the late 1920s disc records would dominate the market until they were supplanted by the compact disc starting from the 1980s early disc recordings were produced in a variety of speeds ranging from 60 rpm to 120 rpm and a variety of sizes at least one manufacturer philips produced records that played at a constant linear velocity as these were played from the inside to the outside the rpm of the record reduced as reproduction progressed as early as 1894 emile berliner s united states gramophone company was selling single sided 7 discs with an advertised standard speed of about 70 rpm one standard audio recording handbook describes speed regulators or governors as being part of a wave of improvement introduced rapidly after 1897 a picture of a hand cranked 1898 victrola shows a governor it says that spring drives replaced hand drives it notes that the speed regular was furnished with an indicator that showed the speed when the machine was running so that the records on reproduction could be revolved at exactly the same speed the literature does not disclose why 78 rpm was chosen for the phonograph industry apparently this just happened to be the speed created by one of the early machines and for no other reason continued to be used by 1925 the speed of the record became standardised at a nominal value of 78 rpm however the standard was to differ between america and the rest of the world the actual 78 speed in america was 78 26 rpm being the speed of 3600 rpm synchronous motor reduced by 46 1 gearing throughout the rest of the world 77 92 rpm was adopted being the speed of a 3000 rpm synchronous motor early recordings were made entirely acoustically the sound being collected by a horn and piped to a diaphragm which vibrated the cutting stylus sensitivity and frequency range were poor and frequency response was very irregular giving cylinder recordings an instantly recognizable tonal quality a singer practically had to put his face in the recording horn cellos and double basses were completely unrecordable violins were barely recordable but instruments were modified with a horn built into the sound box to direct the sound into the recorder s horn when a jazz group recorded drums were completely eliminated because their vibrations would dislodge the cutting stylus from the groove the loudest instruments stood the farthest away from the collecting horn lillian hardin armstrong a member of king oliver s creole jazz band that recorded at gennett records in 1923 remembered that at first oliver and his young second trumpet louis armstrong stood next to each other and oliver s horn couldn t be heard they put louis about fifteen feet over in the corner looking all sad during the 1920s engineers including orlando r marsh as well as those at western electric developed technology for capturing sound with microphones amplifying it with vacuum tubes and using the amplified signal to drive an electromagnetic recording head a wide frequency range could now be recorded and there was no longer any limit on playback volume although the technology used vacuum tubes and today would be described as electronic at the time it was referred to as electrical a 1926 wanamaker s ad in the new york times offers records by the latest victor process of electrical recording it was recognized as a breakthrough in a times music critic stated  the time has come for serious musical criticism to take account of performances of great music reproduced by means of the records to claim that the records of succeeded in exact and complete reproduction of all details of symphonic or operatic performances would be extravagant the article of today is so far in advance of the old machines has hardly to admit classification under the same name electrical recording and reproduction have combined to retain vitality and color in recitals by proxy peter carl goldmark was a hungarian engineer during his time with columbia records was instrumental in developing the long playing microgroove 33⅓ rpm vinyl phonograph discs which defined home audio for two generations electrical recording preceded electrical home reproduction because of the initial high cost of the electronics in 1925 the victor company introduced the groundbreaking victor orthophonic victrola an acoustical record player that was specifically designed to play electrically recorded discs as part of a line that also included electrically reproducing electrolas the acoustical orthophonics ranged in price from us 95 to 300 depending on cabinetry by comparison the cheapest electrola cost us 650 the orthophonic had an interior folded exponential horn a sophisticated design informed by impedance matching and transmission line theory and designed to provide a relatively flat frequency response its first public demonstration was front page news in the new york times which reported that the audience broke into applause john philip sousa gentleman that is a band this is the first time i have ever heard music with any soul to it produced by a mechanical talking machine  the new instrument is a feat of mathematics and physics it is not the result of innumerable experiments but was worked out on paper in advance of being built in the laboratory  the new machine has a range of from 100 to 5 000 frequencies or five and a half octaves  the phonograph tone is eliminated by the new recording and reproducing process gradually electrical reproduction entered the home the clockwork motor was replaced by an electric motor the needle and diaphragm was replaced with a pickup using either a steel or sapphire stylus and a transducer to convert the groove vibrations into an electrical signal the exponential horn became an amplifier and loudspeaker early disc records were made of various materials including hard rubber from 1897 onwards earlier materials were largely replaced by a rather brittle formula of 25 shellac a filler of a cotton compound similar to manila paper powdered slate and a small amount of a wax lubricant the mass production of shellac records began in 1898 in hanover germany and continued until the end of the 78 rpm format in the late 1950s unbreakable records usually of celluloid on a pasteboard base were made from 1904 onwards but they suffered from an exceptionally high level of surface noise unbreakable records could be bent broken or otherwise damaged but not nearly as easily as shellac records vinyl was first tried out as a 78 rpm record material in 1940 due to material restrictions decca introduced vinyl deccalite 78s after the second world war and victor made some vinyl 78s but other labels would restrict vinyl production to the newer 33 and 45 formats in the 1890s the early recording formats of discs were usually seven inches in diameter by 1910 the 10 inch record was by far the most popular standard holding about three minutes of music or entertainment on a side from 1903 onwards 12 inch records were also commercially sold mostly of classical music or operatic selections with four to five minutes of music per side however other sizes did appear an 8 inch disc with a 2 inch diameter label became popular though short lived in europe they cannot completely be played on much modern equipment because the tone arm cannot reach in far enough the playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing at the beginning of the 20th century the early discs played for two minutes the same as early cylinder records the 12 inch disc introduced by victor in 1903 increased the playing time to three and a half minutes because a 10 inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10 inch size was the standard size for popular music almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length for example when king oliver s creole jazz band including louis armstrong on his first recordings recorded 13 sides at gennett records in richmond indiana in 1923 one side was 2 09 and four sides were 2 52 2 59 by 1938 when milt gabler started recording on january 17 for his new label commodore records to allow longer continuous performances he recorded some 12 records eddie condon explained gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development the first two 12 recordings did not take advantage of the extra length carnegie grag was 3 15 carnegie jump 2 41 but at the second session on april 30 the two 12 recordings were longer embraceable you was 4 05 serenade to a shylock 4 32 another way around the time limitation was to issue a selection on both sides of a single record vaudeville stars gallagher and shean recorded mr gallagher and mr shean written by irving and jack kaufman as two sides of a 10 78 in 1922 for cameo an obvious workaround for longer recordings was to release a set of records the first multi record release was in 1903 when hmv in england made the first complete recording of an opera verdi s ernani on 40 single sided discs in 1940 commodore released eddie condon and his band s recording of a good man is hard to find in four parts issued on both sides of two 12 78s this limitation on the length of both popular music and jazz songs persisted from 1910 until the invention of the lp in 1948 in popular music this time limitation of about 3 30 on a 10 78 rpm record meant that singers usually did not release long songs on record one exception is frank sinatra s recording of richard rodgers s and oscar hammerstein ii s soliloquy from carousel made on may 28 1946 because it ran 7 57 longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10 record it was released on columbia s masterwork label as two sides of a 12 record in the 78 era classical music and spoken word items generally were released on the longer 12 78s about 4 5 minutes per side for example on june 10 1924 four months after the february 12 premier of rhapsody in blue george gershwin recorded it with paul whiteman and his orchestra it was released on two sides of victor 55225 and runs 8 59 look under the titlesuch 78 rpm records were usually sold separately in brown paper or cardboard sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed to show the producer or the retailer s name generally the sleeves had a circular cut out allowing the record label to be seen records could be laid on a shelf horizontally or stood upright on an edge but because of their fragility many broke in storage german record company odeon is often said to have pioneered the album in 1909 when it released the nutcracker suite by tchaikovsky on 4 double sided discs in a specially designed package  however deutsche grammophon had produced an album for its complete recording of the opera carmen in the previous year the practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been widely taken up by other record companies for many years however hmv provided an album with a pictorial cover for the 1917 recording of the mikado by about 1910 bound collections of empty sleeves with a cardboard or leather cover similar to a photograph album were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records these albums came in both 10 and 12 sizes the covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright like a book suspending the fragile records above the shelf and protecting them starting in the 1930s record companies began issuing collections of 78 rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums by the 1940s these albums featured their own colorful paper covers and were in both 10 inch and 12 inch sizes and could include either a collection of related popular songs either by performer or style or extended length classical music including complete symphonies the result is that when the lp came along and included multiple songs the name album came along too both the microgroove lp 33⅓ rpm record and the 45 rpm single records are made from vinyl plastic that is flexible and unbreakable in normal use however the vinyl records are easier to scratch or gouge and much more prone to warping in 1930 rca victor launched the first commercially available vinyl long playing record marketed as program transcription discs these revolutionary discs were designed for playback at 33⅓ rpm and pressed on a 30 cm diameter flexible plastic disc in roland gelatt s book the fabulous phonograph the author notes that rca victor s early introduction of a long play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the great depression there was also a small batch of longer playing records issued in the very early 1930s a handful were issued by columbia on a special 18000 d series and labels like crown and perfect also issued a few 10 records playing nearly five hours long however vinyl s lower surface noise level than shellac was not forgotten nor was its durability in the late 30s radio commercials and pre recorded radio programs being sent to disc jockeys started being stamped in vinyl so they would not break in the mail in the mid 1940s special dj copies of records started being made of vinyl also for the same reason these were all 78 rpm during and after world war ii when shellac supplies were extremely limited some 78 rpm records were pressed in vinyl instead of shellac particularly the six minute 12 inch 78 rpm records produced by v disc for distribution to us troops in world war ii in the 40s radio transcriptions which were usually on 16 inch records but sometimes 12 inch were always made of vinyl but cut at 33 1 3 rpm shorter transcriptions were often cut at 78 rpm beginning in 1939 dr peter goldmark and his staff at columbia records undertook efforts to address problems of recording and playing back narrow grooves and developing an inexpensive reliable consumer playback system in 1948 the 12 inch long play 33⅓ rpm microgroove record album was introduced by the columbia record company at a new york press conference on june 21 1948 in february 1949 rca victor released the first 45 rpm single 7 inches in diameter with a large center hole to accommodate an automatic play mechanism on the changer so a stack of singles would drop down one record at a time automatically after each play early 45 rpm records were made from either vinyl or polystyrene they had a playing time of eight minutes on a small number of early phonograph systems and radio transcription discs as well as some entire albums the direction of the groove is reversed beginning near the center of the disc and leading to the outside a small number of records were manufactured with multiple separate grooves to differentiate the tracks x2 was pioneered by ron murphy and heath brunner from sound enterprises a record mastering company in detroit the earliest rotation speeds varied widely most records made in 1900 1925 were recorded at 74 82 revolutions per minute however a few unusual systems were deployed the dutch philips company introduced records whose rotational speed varied such that the reproducing needle ran at a constant linear velocity in the groove these records also unusually played from the inside to the outside both of these features were to be emulated by the modern day compact disc the london science museum displays a philips clv record marked as speed d in 1925 78 26 rpm was chosen as the standard because of the introduction of the electrically powered synchronous turntable motor this motor ran at 3600 rpm with a 46 1 gear ratio which produced 78 26 rpm in parts of the world that used 50 hz current the standard was 77 92 rpm which was also the speed at which a strobe disc with 77 lines would stand still in 50 hz light after world war ii these records were retroactively known as 78s to distinguish them from other newer disc record formats earlier they were just called records or when there was a need to distinguish them from cylinders disc records after world war ii two new competing formats came on to the market and gradually replaced the standard 78 the 33⅓ rpm and the 45 rpm the 33⅓ rpm lp format was developed by columbia records and marketed in 1948 rca victor developed the 45 rpm format and marketed it in 1949 in response to columbia both types of new disc used narrower grooves intended to be played with smaller styli typically 0 001 inches wide compared to 0 003 inches for a 78 so the new records were sometimes called microgroove in the mid 1950s all record companies agreed to a common recording standard called riaa equalization prior to the establishment of the standard each company used its own preferred standard requiring discriminating listeners to use pre amplifiers with multiple selectable equalization curves it should be noted that while stroboscopic speed checkers can be used to correctly adjust a turntable speed to 45 rpm in the us where the stroboscope disc is illuminated by a lamp run from a 60 hz supply most strobes are slightly inaccurate where there is a 50 hz supply using a conventional single segment per pulse the nearest that can be achieved is 45 112  rpm which requires a disc with 133 segments the difference amounts to the record sounding sharp by about a twenty fifth of a semitone to construct a 50 hz stroboscope disc that appears stationary at exactly 45 rpm is possible and would require 400 segments advancing by 3 segments on each pulse of light a number of recordings were pressed at 16⅔ rpm peter goldmark the man who developed the 33⅓ rpm record developed the highway hi fi 16⅔ rpm record to be played in chrysler automobiles but poor performance of the system and weak implementation by chrysler and columbia led to the demise of the 16⅔ rpm records subsequently the 16⅔ rpm speed was used for radio transcription discs or narrated publications for the blind and visually impaired and were never widely commercially available although it was common to see new turntable models with a 16 rpm speed setting produced as late as the 1970s the older 78 format continued to be mass produced alongside the newer formats into the 1950s and in a few countries such as india into the 1960s for example columbia records last reissue of frank sinatra songs on 78 rpm records was an album called young at heart issued november 1 1954 as late as the 1970s some children s records were released at the 78 rpm speed the commercial rivalry between rca victor and columbia records led to rca victor s introduction of what it had intended to be a competing vinyl format the 7 inch 45 rpm disc for a two year period from 1948 to 1950 record companies and consumers faced uncertainty over which of these formats would ultimately prevail in what was known as the war of the speeds in 1949 capitol and decca adopted the new lp format and rca gave in and issued its first lp in january 1950 but the 45 rpm size was gaining in popularity too and columbia issued its first 45s in february 1951 by 1954 200 million 45s had been sold eventually the 12 inch 33⅓ rpm lp prevailed as the predominant format for musical albums and the 10 lp were no longer issued the last columbia records reissue of any frank sinatra songs on a 10 lp record was an album called hall of fame cl 2600 issued october 26 1956 containing six songs one each by tony bennett rosemary clooney johnny ray frank sinatra doris day and frankie laine the 7 inch 45 rpm disc or single established a significant niche for shorter duration discs typically containing one song on each side the 45 rpm discs typically emulated the playing time of the former 78 rpm discs while the 12 lp discs provided up to one half hour of time per side the amount of music per lp varied from label to label and possibly from performer to performer frank sinatra s a swinging affair a monaural album contained 15 songs and ran 50 minutes other albums by other performers could run as little as 30 or 35 minutes after the introduction of stereophonic recording record times dropped because presumably the early stereo groove was wider than the monaural groove the 45 rpm discs also came in a variety known as extended play which achieved up to 10 15 minutes play at the expense of attenuating the sound to reduce the width required by the groove ep discs were generally used to reissue lp albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45 rpm players lp albums could be purchased 1 ep at a time with four songs per ep or in a boxed set with 3 eps or 12 songs the large center hole on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms eps were generally discontinued by the late 1950s as three and four speed record players replaced the individual 45 players one indication of the decline of the 45 rpm ep is that the last columbia records reissue of frank sinatra songs on 45 rpm ep records called frank sinatra was issued december 7 1959 in the late 1940s and early 1950s 45 rpm only players that lacked speakers and plugged into a jack on the back of a radio were widely available eventually they were replaced by the three speed record player from the mid 1950s through the 1960s in the u s the common home record player or stereo would typically have had these features a three or four speed player with changer a tall spindle that would hold several records and automatically drop a new record on top of the previous one when it had finished playing a combination cartridge with both 78 and microgroove styluses and a way to flip between the two and some kind of adapter for playing the 45s with their larger center hole the adapter could be a small solid circle that fit onto the bottom of the spindle or a larger adaptor that fit over the entire spindle permitting a stack of 45s to be played rca 45s were also adapted to the smaller spindle of an lp player with a plastic snap in insert known as a spider these inserts commissioned by rca president david sarnoff and invented by thomas hutchison were prevalent starting in the 1960s selling in the tens of millions per year during the 45 s heyday in countries outside of the us 45s often had the smaller album sized holes or otherwise a pseudo spider was built in to the record which could be punched out if desired deliberately playing or recording records at a higher speed gave an antic quirkiness to voices doing so at a slower speed changed music and voice to an ominous growling tone this effect was used in 1966 by cork marcheschi of california group the ethix who issued an experimental single bad trip which could be played at any speed canadian musician nash the slash also took advantage of this speed tonal effect with his 1981 12 inch disc decomposing which featured four instrumental tracks that were engineered to play at any speed music from a 33⅓ rpm lp of the animated musical group alvin and the chipmunks can be played at 16 rpm to reveal how male voices singing very slowly are used to produce the high pitched rodents voices apparently singing the song at normal speed as the lp became established as the dominant size for longer recordings several developments were made to enhance the sound the first of these was the attempt to develop high fidelity or hi fi sound people who were concerned with hearing all the quality sound now embedded in the new lps began to buy separate turntables amplifiers speakers and woofers to get the best sound possible stan freberg satirized these fans in his 1956 radio show with a skit about a man who turned his whole house into a speaker in 1958 the first stereo two channel records were issued by audio fidelity in the usa and pye in britain using the westrex 45 45 single groove system while the stylus moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording on stereo records the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally one could envision a system in which the left channel was recorded laterally as on a monophonic recording with the right channel information recorded with a hill and dale vertical motion such systems were proposed but not adopted due to their incompatibility with existing phono pickup designs in the westrex system each channel drives the cutting head at a 45 degree angle to the vertical during playback the combined signal is sensed by a left channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the inner side of the groove and a right channel coil mounted diagonally opposite the outer side of the groove it is helpful to think of the combined stylus motion in terms of the vector sum and difference of the two stereo channels effectively all horizontal stylus motion conveys the l r sum signal and vertical stylus motion carries the l r difference signal the advantages of the 45 45 system are this system was invented by alan blumlein of emi in 1931 and patented the same year emi cut the first stereo test discs using the system in 1933 it was not used commercially until a quarter of a century later stereo sound provides a more natural listening experience where the spatial location of the source of a sound is at least in part reproduced under the direction of c robert fine mercury records initiated a minimalist single microphone monaural recording technique in 1951 the first record kubelik chicago s performance of pictures at an exhibition was described as being in the living presence of the orchestra by the new york times music critic the series of records was then named mercury living presence in 1955 mercury began three channel stereo recordings still based on the principle of the single microphone the center microphone was of paramount importance with the two side mics adding depth and space record masters were cut directly from a three track to two track mixdown console with all editing of the master tapes done on the original three tracks in 1961 mercury enhanced this technique with three microphone stereo recordings using 35 mm magnetic film instead of half inch tape for recording the greater thickness and width of 35 mm magnetic film prevented tape layer print through and pre echo and gained extended frequency range and transient response the mercury living presence recordings were remastered to cd in the 1990s by the original producer using the same method of 3 to 2 mix directly to the master recorder the development of quadraphonic records was announced in 1971 these recorded four separate sound signals this was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing where the additional channels were combined into the main signal when the records were played phase detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels there were two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records produced confusingly named sq and qs they proved commercially unsuccessful but were an important precursor to later surround sound systems as seen in sacd and home cinema today a different format cd 4 by rca encoded rear channel information on an ultrasonic carrier which required a special wideband cartridge to capture it on carefully calibrated pickup arm turntable combinations typically the high frequency information inscribed onto these lps wore off after only a few playings and cd 4 was even less successful than the two matrixed formats in the late 1970s and 1980s a method to improve the dynamic range of mass produced records involved highly advanced disc cutting equipment these techniques marketed as the cbs discomputer and teldec direct metal mastering were used to reduce inner groove distortion rca victor introduced another system to boost dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of dynagroove two main elements were combined another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic expansion for masking background noise sometimes this was called diaphragming the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects both elements were reflected in the brandname of dynagroove described elsewhere in more detail furthermore it used advanced forward looking steering on track distance with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk tracks were close to each other with lower volumes and farther away with loud passages also the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end farther away from the inner circle than usual helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further also in the late 1970s direct to disc records were produced aimed at an audiophile niche market these completely bypassed the use of magnetic tape in favor of a purist transcription directly to the master lacquer disc also during this period half speed mastered and original master records were released using expensive state of the art technology a further late 1970s development was the disco eye cued system used mainly on motown 12 inch singles released between 1978 and 1980 the introduction drum breaks or choruses of a track were indicated by widely separated grooves giving a visual clue to djs mixing the records the appearance of these records is similar to an lp but they only contain one track each side the early 1980s saw the introduction of dbx encoded records again for the audiophile niche market these were completely incompatible with standard record playback preamplifiers relying on the dbx compandor encoding decoding scheme to greatly increase dynamic range a similar and very short lived scheme involved using the cbs developed cx noise reduction encoding decoding scheme elpj a japanese based company has developed a player that uses a laser instead of a stylus to read vinyl discs in theory the laser turntable eliminates the possibility of scratches and attendant degradation of the sound but its expense limits use primarily to digital archiving of analog records various other laser based turntables were tried during the 1990s but while a laser reads the groove very accurately since it does not touch the record the dust that vinyl naturally attracts due to static charge is not cleaned from the groove worsening sound quality in casual use compared to conventional stylus playback note before the early 1950s the 33 1 3 rpm lp was most commonly found in a 10 inch format the 10 inch format disappeared from united states stores around 1950 but remained a common format in some markets until the mid 1960s the normal commercial disc is engraved with two sound bearing concentric spiral grooves one on each side of the disc running from the outside edge towards the centre the last part of the spiral meets an earlier part to form a circle the sound is encoded by fine variations in the edges of the groove that cause a stylus placed in it to vibrate at acoustic frequencies when the disc is rotated at the correct speed generally the outer and inner parts of the groove bear no intended sound since the late 1910s both sides of the record have been used to carry the grooves occasionally records were issued in the 1920s with a recording on only one side the recording is played back by rotating the disc clockwise at a constant rotational speed with a stylus placed in the groove converting the vibrations of the stylus into an electric signal and sending this signal through an amplifier to loudspeakers the majority of non 78 rpm records are pressed on black vinyl the colouring material used to blacken the transparent pvc plastic mix is carbon black carbon black increases the strength of the disc and renders it opaque polystyrene is often used for 7 inch recordssome records are pressed on coloured vinyl or with paper pictures embedded in them certain 45 rpm rca or rca victor red seal records used red translucent vinyl for extra red seal effect during the 1980s there was a trend for releasing singles on coloured vinyl sometimes with large inserts that could be used as posters this trend has been revived recently with 7 inch singles vinyl record standards for the united states follow the guidelines of the recording industry association of america the inch dimensions are nominal not precise diameters the actual dimension of a 12 inch record is 302 mm for a 10 inch it is 250 mm and for a 7 inch it is 175 mm records made in other countries are standardized by different organizations but are very similar in size the record diameters are typically 300 mm 250 mm and 175 mm there is an area about 6 mm wide at the outer edge of the disk called the lead in where the groove is widely spaced and silent this section allows the stylus to be dropped at the start of the record groove without damaging the recorded section of the groove between each track on the recorded section of an lp record there is usually a short gap of around 1 mm where the groove is widely spaced this space is clearly visible making it easy to find a particular track towards the label centre at the end of the groove there is another wide pitched section known as the lead out at the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a complete circle called the lock groove when the stylus reaches this point it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record on some recordings the sound continues on the lock groove which gives a strange repeating effect automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm as it reaches these more widely spaced grooves to trigger a mechanism that raises the arm and moves it out of the way of the record the catalog number and stamper id is written or stamped in the space between the groove in the lead out on the master disc resulting in visible recessed writing on the final version of a record sometimes the cutting engineer might add handwritten comments or their signature if they are particularly pleased with the quality of the cut when auto changing turntables were commonplace records were typically pressed with a raised outer edge and a raised label area this would allow records to be stacked onto each other gripping each other without the delicate grooves coming into contact thus reducing the risk of damage auto changing turntables included a mechanism to support a stack of several records above the turntable itself dropping them one at a time onto the active turntable to be played in order many longer sound recordings such as complete operas were interleaved across several 10 inch or 12 inch discs for use with auto changing mechanisms so that the first disk of a three disk recording would carry sides 1 and 6 of the program while the second disk would carry sides 2 and 5 and the third sides 3 and 4 allowing sides 1 2 and 3 to be played automatically then the whole stack reversed to play sides 4 5 and 6 the sound quality and durability of vinyl records is highly dependent on the quality of the vinyl during the early 1970s as a cost cutting move towards use of lightweight flexible vinyl pressings much of the industry adopted a technique of reducing the thickness and quality of vinyl used in mass market manufacturing marketed by rca victor as the dynaflex process considered inferior by most record collectors most vinyl records are pressed on recycled vinyl new virgin or heavy vinyl is commonly used for modern audiophile vinyl releases in all genres many collectors prefer to have 180 g vinyl albums and they have been reported to have a better sound than normal vinyl these albums tend to withstand the deformation caused by normal play better than regular vinyl 180 g vinyl is more expensive to produce and requires higher quality manufacturing processes than regular vinyl since most vinyl records are from recycled plastic impurities can be accumulated in the record causing a brand new album to have audio artifacts like clicks and pops virgin vinyl means that the album is not from recycled plastic and will theoretically be devoid of these impurities in practice this depends on the manufacturer s quality control the orange peel effect on vinyl records is caused by worn moulds rather than having the proper mirror like finish the surface of the record will have what looks like an orange peel texture this introduces noise into the record particularly in the lower frequency range it should be noted that with direct metal mastering the master disc is cut on a copper coated disc which can also have a minor orange peel effect as this orange peel originates in the master rather than being introduced in the pressing stage there is no ill effect while most vinyl records are pressed from metal discs known as stampers a technique known as lathe cutting is used to create the original discs a lathe is used to cut microgrooves into an aluminium disc coated with a soft lacquer this lacquer disc is then electroplated with nickel to form a negative known as a master disc which has a protrusion rather than a groove the lacquer disc is destroyed when the nickel impression is separated this master disc is then electroplated with nickel to form a positive disc known as a mother many mothers can be grown from a single master before the master deteriorates beyond use in their own turn the mothers are nickel plated to produce more negative discs known as stampers again a single mother can grow many stampers before they deteriorate beyond use it is these stampers that are then used to mould the final vinyl discs in this way several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer original for production of discs where a relatively small quantity is required the first nickel negative grown from the lacquer original is used directly as a stamper production by this latter process is limited to a few hundred vinyl discs shellac 78s are brittle and must be handled carefully in the event of a 78 breaking the pieces might remain loosely connected by the label and still be playable if the label holds them together although there is a loud pop with each pass over the crack and breaking of the stylus is likely breakage was very common in the shellac era in the 1934 novel appointment in samarra the protagonist broke one of his most favorites whiteman s lady of the evening  he wanted to cry but could not a poignant moment in j d salinger s 1951 novel the catcher in the rye occurs after the adolescent protagonist buys a record for his younger sister but drops it and it broke into pieces  i damn near cried it made me feel so terrible a sequence where a school teacher s collection of 78 rpm jazz records is smashed by a group of rebellious students is a key moment in the film blackboard jungle another problem with shellac was that the size of the disks tended to be larger due to the fact that it was limited to 80 100 groove walls per inch before the risk of groove collapse became too high whereas vinyl could have up to 260 groove walls per inch vinyl records do not break easily but the soft material is easily scratched vinyl readily acquires a static charge attracting dust that is difficult to remove completely dust and scratches cause audio clicks and pops in extreme cases they can cause the needle to skip over a series of grooves or worse yet cause the needle to skip backwards creating a locked groove that repeats over and over locked grooves were not uncommon and were even heard occasionally in broadcasts vinyl records can be warped by heat improper storage or manufacturing defects such as excessively tight plastic shrinkwrap on the album cover a small degree of warp was common and allowing for it was part of the art of turntable and tonearm design wow could result from warp or from a spindle hole that was not precisely centered standard practice for lps which were more expensive than singles was to include the lp in a plastic lined inner cover this if placed within the outer cardboard cover so that the opening was entirely within the outer cover was said to reduce ingress of dust onto the record surface singles with rare exceptions had simple paper covers with no inner cover there is controversy about the relative quality of cd sound and lp sound when the latter is heard under the very best conditions a further limitation of the record is that with a constant rotational speed the quality of the sound may differ across the width of the record because the inner groove modulations are more compressed than those of the outer tracks the result is that inner tracks have distortion that can be noticeable at higher recording levels 7 inch singles were typically poorer quality for a variety of the reasons mentioned above and in the 1970s the 12 inch single manufactured at both 33 1 3 and 45 rpm became popular for dj use and for fans and collectors another problem arises because of the geometry of the tonearm master recordings are cut on a recording lathe where a sapphire stylus moves radially across the blank suspended on a straight track and driven by a lead screw most turntables use a pivoting tonearm introducing side forces and pitch and azimuth errors and thus distortion in the playback signal various mechanisms were devised in attempts to compensate with varying degrees of success see more at phonograph in 1925 electric recording extended the recorded frequency range from acoustic recording by 2½ octaves to 100 5000 hz even so these early electronically recorded records used the exponential horn phonograph for reproduction the frequency response of vinyl records may be degraded by frequent playback if the cartridge is set to track too heavily or the stylus is not compliant enough to trace the high frequency grooves accurately or the cartridge tonearm is not properly aligned the best cartridges and styli have response up to 76 khz the riaa has suggested the following acceptable losses down to 20 khz after one play 18 khz after three plays 17 khz after five 16 khz after eight 14 khz after fifteen 13 khz after twenty five 10 khz after thirty five and 8 khz after eighty plays while this degradation is possible if the record is played on improperly set up equipment many collectors of lps report excellent sound quality on lps played many more times when using care and high quality equipment this rapid sound degradation is not usually typical on modern hi fi equipment with a properly balanced tonearm and well balanced low mass stylus the riaa standard represents only the maximum acceptable losses most properly setup hi fi systems can provide much higher record life and sound quality cd 4 lps contain two sub carriers one in the left groove wall and one in the right groove wall these sub carriers use special fm pm ssbfm and have signal frequencies that extend to 45 khz many record collectors report that the cd 4 sub carriers are still playable even though the records have been played extensively and are in excess of 30 years old it should be noted that these records could be played with any type stylus as long as the pickup cartridge had cd 4 frequency response the recommended stylus for cd 4 as well as regular stereo records was a line contact or shibata type gramophone sound suffers from rumble low frequency mechanical noise generated by the motor bearings and picked up by the stylus equipment of modest quality is relatively unaffected by these issues as the amplifier and speaker will not reproduce such low frequencies but high fidelity turntable assemblies need careful design to minimize audible rumble room vibrations will also be picked up if the pedestal turntable pickup arm stylus system is not well damped tonearm skating forces and other perturbations are also picked up by the stylus this is a form of frequency multiplexing as the control signal used to keep the stylus in the groove is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself subsonic frequencies below about 20 hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects which is one form of unwanted rumble and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100 hz high fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble during a quiet passage woofer speaker cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking of the stylus at frequencies as low as about 0 5 hz another reason for very low frequency material can be a warped disk its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and presentday amplifiers have large power bandwidths for this reason many stereo receivers contained a switchable subsonic filer some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel if played back on a mono subwoofer system the noise will cancel significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced at high audible frequencies hiss is generated as the stylus rubs against the vinyl and from dirt and dust on the vinyl noise can be reduced somewhat by cleaning the record prior to playback another method introduced by the lenco company is playing the disk wet using a special dispenser the groove is wetted ahead of the stylus passing by and dries up afterwards this certainly reduces hiss but when it became clear that any disk once played wet should forever be played this way because of residue left behind people did not change over in great numbers with normal cleaning this problem does not occur due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae with low frequencies the stylus must swing a long way from side to side requiring the groove to be wide taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record at high frequencies noise is significant these problems can be compensated for by using equalization to an agreed standard this simply means reducing the amplitude at low frequencies thus reducing the groove width required and increasing the amplitude at high frequencies the playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble in a complementary way the result should be that the sound is perceived to be without change thus more music will fit the record and noise is reduced the agreed standard has been riaa equalization since 1952 implemented in 1955 prior to that especially from 1940 some 100 formulae were used by the record manufacturers in 1926 it was disclosed by joseph p maxwell and henry c harrison from bell telephone laboratories that the recording pattern of the western electric rubber line magnetic disc cutter had a constant velocity characteristic this meant that as frequency increased in the treble recording amplitude decreased conversely in the bass as frequency decreased recording amplitude increased therefore it was necessary to attenuate the bass frequencies below about 250 hz the bass turnover point in the amplified microphone signal fed to the recording head otherwise bass modulation became excessive and overcutting took place into the next record groove when played back electrically with a magnetic pickup having a smooth response in the bass region a complementary boost in amplitude at the bass turnover point was necessary g h miller in 1934 reported that when complementary boost at the turnover point was used in radio broadcasts of records the reproduction was more realistic and many of the musical instruments stood out in their true form west in 1930 and later p g h voight showed that the early wente style condenser microphones contributed to a 4 to 6 db midrange brilliance or pre emphasis in the recording chain this meant that the electrical recording characteristics of w e licensees such as columbia records and victor talking machine company in the 1925 era had a higher amplitude in the midrange region brilliance such as this compensated for dullness in many early magnetic pickups having drooping midrange and treble response as a result this practice was the empirical beginning of using pre emphasis above 1 000 hz in 78 rpm and 33 1 3 rpm records over the years a variety of record equalization practices emerged and there was no industry standard for example in europe recordings for years required playback with a bass turnover setting of 250 300 hz and a treble rolloff at 10 000 hz ranging from 0 to 5 db or more in the united states there were more varied practices and a tendency to use higher bass turnover frequencies such as 500 hz as well as a greater treble rolloff like 8 5 db and even more to record generally higher modulation levels on the record evidence from the early technical literature concerning electrical recording suggests that it wasn t until the 1942 1949 period that there were serious efforts to standardize recording characteristics within an industry heretofore electrical recording technology from company to company was considered a proprietary art all the way back to the 1925 w e licensed method used by columbia and victor for example what brunswick balke collender did was different from the practices of victor broadcasters were faced with having to adapt daily to the varied recording characteristics of many sources various makers of home recordings readily available to the public european recordings lateral cut transcriptions and vertical cut transcriptions efforts were started in 1942 to standardize within the national association of broadcasters later known as the national association of radio and television broadcasters the nab among other items issued recording standards in 1949 for laterally and vertically cut records principally transcriptions a number of 78 rpm record producers as well as early lp makers also cut their records to the nab nartb lateral standard the lateral cut nab curve was remarkably similar to the nbc orthacoustic curve which evolved from practices within the national broadcasting company since the mid 1930s empirically and not by any formula it was learned that the bass end of the audio spectrum below 100 hz could be boosted somewhat to override system hum and turntable rumble noises likewise at the treble end beginning at 1 000 hz if audio frequencies were boosted by 16 db at 10 000 hz the delicate sibilant sounds of speech and high overtones of musical instruments could survive the noise level of cellulose acetate lacquer aluminum and vinyl disc media when the record was played back using a complementary inverse curve signal to noise ratio was improved and the programming sounded more life like when the columbia lp was released in june 1948 the developers subsequently published technical information about the 33 1 3 rpm microgroove long playing record columbia disclosed a recording characteristic showing that it was like the nab curve in the treble but had more bass boost or pre emphasis below 200 hz the authors disclosed electrical network characteristics for the columbia lp curve this was the first such curve based on formulae in 1951 at the beginning of the post world war ii high fidelity popularity the audio engineering society developed a standard playback curve this was intended for use by hi fi amplifier manufacturers if records were engineered to sound good on hi fi amplifiers using the aes curve this would be a worthy goal towards standardization this curve was defined by the time constants of audio filters and had a bass turnover of 400 hz and a 10 000 hz rolloff of 12 db rca victor and columbia were in a market war concerning which recorded format was going to win the columbia lp versus the rca victor 45 rpm disc besides also being a battle of disc size and record speed there was a technical difference in the recording characteristics rca victor was using new orthophonic whereas columbia was using the lp curve ultimately the new orthophonic curve was disclosed in a publication by r c moyer of rca victor in 1953 he traced rca victor characteristics back to the w e rubber line recorder in 1925 up to the early 1950s laying claim to long held recording practices and reasons for major changes in the intervening years the rca victor new orthophonic curve was within the tolerances for the nab nartb columbia lp and aes curves it eventually became the technical predecessor to the riaa curve and superseded all other curves by the time of the stereo lp in 1958 the riaa curve identical to the rca victor new orthophonic curve became standard throughout the national and international record markets overall sound fidelity of records produced acoustically using horns instead of microphones had a distant hollow tone quality some voices and instruments recorded better than others enrico caruso famous tenor was one popular recording artist of the acoustic era that was well matched to the recording horn it has been asked did caruso make the phonograph or did the phonograph make caruso delicate sounds and fine overtones were mostly lost because it took a lot of sound energy to vibrate the recording horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism there were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn not withstanding a 50 reduction in distortion because of the modern playback towards the end of the acoustic era there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns electric recording which developed during the time that early radio was becoming popular benefited from the microphones and amplifiers used in radio studios the early electric recordings were reminiscent tonally of acoustic recordings except there was more recorded bass and treble as well as delicate sounds and overtones cut on the records this was in spite of some carbon microphones used which had resonances that colored the recorded tone the double button carbon microphone with stretched diaphragm was a marked improvement alternatively the wente style condenser microphone used with the western electric licensed recording method had a brilliant midrange and was prone to overloading from sibilants in speech but it was generally better at picking up sounds more accurately than carbon microphones were it was not unusual however for electric recordings to be played back on acoustic phonographs the victor orthophonic phonograph was a prime example where such playback was expected in the orthophonic which benefited from telephone research the mechanical pickup head was redesigned with lower resonance than the traditional mica type also a folded horn with an exponential taper was constructed inside the cabinet to provide better impedance matching to the air as a result playback of an orthophonic record sounded like it was coming from a radio eventually when it was more common for electric recordings to be played back electrically in the 1930s and 40s the overall tone was much like listening to a radio of the era magnetic pickups became more common and were better designed as time went on to dampen spurious resonances crystal pickups were also introduced as lower cost alternatives the dynamic or moving coil microphone was introduced around 1930 and the velocity or ribbon microphone in 1932 both of these high quality microphones became widespread in motion picture radio recording and public address applications over time fidelity dynamic and noise levels improved to the point that it was harder to tell the difference between a live performance in the studio and the recorded version this was especially true after the invention of the variable reluctance magnetic pickup cartridge by general electric in the 1940s when high quality cuts were played on well designed audio systems the capehart radio phonographs of the era with large diameter electrodynamic loudspeakers though not ideal demonstrated this quite well with home recordings readily available in the music stores for the public to buy there were important quality advances in recordings specifically made for radio broadcast in the early 1930s bell telephone laboratories and western electric announced the total reinvention of disc recording the western electric wide range system the new voice of action the intent of the new w e system was to improve the overall quality of disc recording and playback the recording speed was 33 1 3 rpm originally used in the western electric erpi movie audio disc system implemented in the early warner brothers vitaphone talkies of 1927 the newly invented w e moving coil or dynamic microphone was part of the wide range system it had a flatter audio response than the old style wente condenser type and didn t require electronics installed in the microphone housing signals fed to the cutting head were pre emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts the chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch which could be crowded together resulting in longer playback time additionally the problem of inner groove distortion which plagued lateral cuts could be avoided with the vertical cut system wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing vinyl pressings were made with stampers from master cuts that were electroplated in vacuo by means of gold sputtering audio response was claimed out to 8 000 hz later 13 000 hz using light weight pickups employing jeweled styli amplifiers and cutters both using negative feedback were employed thereby improving the range of frequencies cut and lowering distortion levels radio transcription producers such as world broadcasting system and associated music publishers were the dominant licensees of the w e wide range system and towards the end of the 1930s were responsible for two thirds of the total radio transcription business a quantum level of improvement had been achieved and when these recordings are found today in good condition it is amazing to hear what high fidelity sound was like in that era playback of these recordings works well using a bass turnover of 300 hz and a 10 000 hz rolloff of 8 5 db developmentally much of the technology of the long playing record successfully released by columbia in 1948 came from wide range radio transcription practices the use of vinyl pressings increased length of programming and general improvement in audio quality over 78 rpm records were the major selling points the complete technical disclosure of the columbia lp by peter c goldmark rene snepvangers and william s bachman in 1949 made it possible for a great variety of record companies to get into the business of making long playing records the business grew like wild fire as did the widespread interest in high fidelity sound and the do it yourself market for pickups turntables amplifier kits loudspeaker enclosure plans and am fm radio tuners the lp record for longer works 45 rpm for pop songs and fm radio became high fidelity program sources in demand radio listeners heard recordings broadcasted and this in turn generated more record sales the industry flourished technology used in making recordings also developed and prospered basically there were ten major evolutionary steps that perfected lp production and quality during a period of approximately forty years at the time of the introduction of the compact disc in the mid 1980s the stereo lp pressed in vinyl was at the high point of its development still it suffered from a variety of limitations in the early days of compact discs vinyl records were still prized by audiophiles because of better reproduction of analog recordings however the drawback was greater sensitivity to scratches and dust early compact discs were perceived by many as thin and sharp distorting sounds on the high end in some cases this was the result of record companies issuing cds produced from master recordings that were compressed and equalized for vinyl early consumer compact disc players sometimes contained 14 bit digital to analog converters instead of the correct 16 bit type as a cost cutting measure some players were only linear to 10 or 12 bits though digital audio technology has improved over the years some audiophiles still prefer what they perceive as the superior sound of vinyl over cds proponents of digital audio state these differences are generally inaudible to normal human hearing and the lack of clicks hiss and pops from analog recordings greatly improved sound fidelity modern anti aliasing filters and oversampling systems used in digital recordings have reduced the problems observed with early cds the warmer sound of analog records is generally believed on both sides of the argument to be an artifact of harmonic distortion and signal compression this phenomenon of a preference for the sound of a beloved lower fidelity technology is not new a 1963 review of rca dynagroove recordings notes that some listeners object to the ultra smooth sound as  sterile  such distortion forming sounds as those produced by loud brasses are eliminated at the expense of fidelity they prefer for a climactic fortissimo to blast their machines  the theory that vinyl records can audibly represent lower frequencies that compact discs cannot is disputed by some and accepted by others according to red book specifications the compact disc has a frequency response up to 22 05 khz the average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20 hz to a maximum of around 22 000 hz this means that any frequencies that a vinyl record can represent that a compact disc cannot would be inaudible and thus completely subliminal the lower frequency limit of human hearing can vary per person and interference caused by sound in the lower inaudible spectrum can still influence audible sound it s possible that phonograph intermodulation effects from low frequency sources such as rumble and wow could adversely affect audible frequency ranges due to the nature of the medium playback of hard records eg lps causes gradual degradation of the recording the recordings are best preserved by transferring them onto more stable media and playing the records as rarely as possible they need to be stored on edge and do best under environmental conditions that most humans would find comfortable the medium needs to be kept clean but use alcohol only on pvc or optical media not on 78s the equipment for playback of certain formats is manufactured only in small quantities leading to increased difficulty in finding equipment to play the recordings where old disc recordings are considered to be of artistic or historic interest record companies or archivists play back the disc on suitable equipment and record the result typically onto a digital format which can be copied and converted without any further damage to the recording for example nimbus records uses a specially built horn record player to transfer 78s however anyone can do this using a standard record player with a suitable pickup a phono preamp and a typical personal computer once a recording has been digitized it can be manipulated with software to restore and hopefully improve the sound for example by removing the result of scratches it can also be easily converted to other digital formats such as dvd a cd and mp3 as an alternative to playback with a stylus a recording can be read optically processed with software that calculates the velocity that the stylus would be moving in the mapped grooves and converted to a digital recording format this does no further damage to the disc and generally produces a better sound than normal playback this technique also has the potential to allow for reconstruction of damaged or broken disks with regard to inner sleeves plastic polyethylene is purported to be better than the common paper sleeve and less bulky than the poly lined paper variety paper sleeves deteriorate over time leave dusty fibers and produce static that attract dust 100 poly sleeves produce less static are archival and are thinner by nature so they minimize pressure on the lp jacket seams groove recordings first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century held a predominant position for nearly a century withstanding competition from reel to reel tape the 8 track cartridge and the compact cassette however by 1988 the compact disc had surpassed the gramophone record in popularity then vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991 when the major label distributors restricted their return policies which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles first the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns retailers fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered only ordered proven popular titles that they knew would sell and devoted more shelf space to cds and cassettes record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production distribution further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants this rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format s decline in popularity and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to cds which were more profitable for the record companies in spite of their flaws such as the lack of portability records still have enthusiastic supporters vinyl records continue to be manufactured and sold today especially by independent rock bands and labels although record sales are considered to be a niche market composed of audiophiles collectors and djs old records and out of print recordings in particular are in much demand by collectors the world over many popular new albums are given releases on vinyl records and older albums are also given reissues as well sometimes on audiophile grade vinyl with high quality sleeves in the united kingdom sales of new vinyl records have increased significantly in recent years somewhat reversing the downward trend seen during the 1990s in the united states annual vinyl sales increased by 85 8 between 2006 and 2007 and by 89 between 2007 and 2008 many electronic dance music and hip hop releases today are still exclusively on vinyl this is because for disc jockeys vinyl has an advantage over the cd direct manipulation of the medium dj techniques such as slip cueing beatmatching and scratching originated on turntables with cds or compact audio cassettes one normally has only indirect manipulation options e g the play stop and pause buttons with a record one can place the stylus a few grooves farther in or out accelerate or decelerate the turntable or even reverse its direction provided the stylus record player and record itself are built to withstand it however many cdj and dj advances such as dj software and time encoded vinyl now have these capabilities and more in india vinyl was discontinued in the early 1990s however a sizable backlog of titles has resulted in continued popular use of the vinyl lp figures released in the united states in early 2009 showed that sales of vinyl albums nearly doubled in 2008 with 1 88 million sold up from just under 1

butoh is the collective name for a diverse range of activities techniques and motivations for dance performance or movement inspired by the ankoku butoh movement it typically involves playful and grotesque imagery taboo topics extreme or absurd environments and is traditionally performed in white body makeup with slow hyper controlled motion with or without an audience but there is no set style and it may be purely conceptual with no movement at all its origins have been attributed to japanese dance legends tatsumi hijikata and kazuo ohno butoh appeared first in japan after the second world war and the student riots there the roles of authority were being challenged and subverted at this point it also appeared as a reaction against the contemporary dance scene in japan which hijikata felt was based on imitating the west and noh and was too superficial the first butoh piece was kinjiki by tatsumi hijikata which premiered at a dance festival in 1959 based on the novel of the same name by yukio mishima the piece explored the taboo of homosexuality and paedophilia and ended with a live chicken being held between the legs of yoshito ohno and hijikata chasing yoshito off the stage in darkness primarily as a result of the misconception that the chicken had died due to strangulation this piece outraged the audience and resulted in the banning of hijikata from the festival where kinjiki premiered and established him as an iconoclast in the very first butoh performances the style was called dance experience but in the early sixties hijikata used the term ankoku buyo to describe his dance and later changed the word buyo filled with associations of japanese classical dance to that of butoh a long discarded word for dance that originally meant european ballroom dancing in later work hijikata continued to subvert conventional notions of dance inspired by writers such as yukio mishima lautréamont artaud genet and de sade he delved into grotesquerie darkness and decay simultaneously hijikata explored the transmutation of the human body into other forms such as animals he also developed a poetic and surreal choreographic language butoh fu to help the dancer transform into other materials the work developed beginning in 1960 by kazuo ohno with tatsumi hijikata was the beginning of what now is regarded as butoh in jean viala s and nourit masson sekinea s book shades of darkness kazuo ohno is regarded as the soul of butoh while tatsumi hijikata is seen as the architect of butoh tatsumi hijikata and kazuo ohno later developed their own styles of teaching separate from each other students of each style went on to create many different groups such as sankai juku a japanese dance group well known to fans in north america students of these two great artists have been known to show up the differing orientations of their masters while hijikata was a fearsome technician of the nervous system influencing input strategies and artists working in groups ohno is thought of as a more natural individual and nurturing figure who influenced solo artists there is much discussion about who should receive the credit for creating butoh as artists worked to create new art in all disciplines after world war ii japan artists and thinkers emerged out of economic and social challenges that produced an energy and renewal of artists dancers painters musicians writers and all artists a number of people with few formal connections to hijikata began to call their own idiosyncratic dance butoh among these we can include iwana masaki tanaka min and teru goi although all manner of systematic thinking about butoh dance can be found perhaps iwana masaki most accurately sums up the variety of butoh styles while ankoku butoh can be said to have possessed a very precise method and philosophy i regard present day butoh as a tendency that depends not only on hijikata s philosophical legacy but also on the development of new and diverse modes of expression the tendency that i speak of involved extricating the pure life which is dormant in our bodies hijikata is often quoted saying what opposition he had to a codified dance since i believe neither in a dance teaching method nor in controlling movement i do not teach in this manner however in the pursuit and development of his own work it is only natural that a hijikata style of working and therefore a method emerged both mikami kayo and maro akaji have stated that hijikata exhorted his disciples to not imitate his own dance when they left to create their own butoh dance groups if this is the case then his words make sense there are as many types of butoh as there are butoh choreographers starting in the early 1980s butoh experienced a renaissance as butoh groups began performing outside japan for the first time the most famous of these groups is sankai juku in a performance by sankai juku in which the performers hung upside down from ropes from a tall building in seattle washington one of the ropes broke resulting in the death of the performer the footage was played on national news whereby butoh became more widely known in america through the tragedy a pbs documentary of a butoh performance in a cave with no audience further broadened knowledge in america in the early 1990s koichi tamano performed atop the giant drum of san francisco taiko dojo inside grace cathedral in an international religious celebration 
butoh s status at present is ambiguous accepted as a performance art overseas it remains fairly unknown in japan a butoh performance choreographed by yoshito ohno appears at the beginning of the tokyo section of hal hartley s 1996 film flirt ron fricke s experimental documentary film baraka features scenes of butoh performance in the late 1960s horror exploitation director teruo ishii hired hijikata to play the role of a doctor moreau like reclusive mad scientist in his film horrors of malformed men a role that is mostly performed as dance the film has remained largely unseen in japan for forty years because it was viewed as insensitive to the handicapped kiyoshi kurosawa used butoh movement for actors in his 2001 film kairo remade in hollywood in 2006 as pulse the re make did not feature butoh butoh performance features heavily in doris dörrie s 2008 film cherry blossoms in which a bavarian man embarks on a journey to japan to grieve for his late wife and develop an understanding of this performance style for which she held a life long fascination a portrait of kazuo ohno appears on the cover of antony the johnsons 2009 album the crying light principal dancer for hijikata was koichi tamano koichi tamano made his united states debut in 1976 at the japan now exhibition at the san francisco museum of modern art hijikata called koichi tamano the bow legged nijinsky a quote later rendered in english by alan ginsberg classical butoh is frequently semi nude and muscle worshipping japanese novelist yukio mishima considered koichi tamano to have the most perfect body among japanese dancers koichi tamano was declared a national treasure by the emperor of japan tamano frequently dances atop ten foot tall drum of played by seiichi tanaka grand master of san francisco taiko dojo at international taiko festivals most butoh exercises use image work to varying degrees from the razorblades and insects of ankoku butoh to dairakudakan s threads and water jets to seiryukai s rod in the body there is a general trend towards the body as being moved from an internal or external source rather than consciously moving a body part a certain element of control vs uncontrol is present through many of the exercises looked at from completely scientific standpoint this is rarely possible unless under great duress or pain but as kurihara points out pain starvation and sleep deprivation were all part of life under hijikata s method which may have helped the dancers access a movement space where the movement cues had terrific power it is also worth noting that hijikata s movement cues are in general much more visceral and complicated than anything else since exercises from japan most all have specific body shapes or general postures assigned to them while almost none of the exercises from western butoh dancers have specific shapes this seems to point to a general trend in the west that butoh is not seen as specific movement cues with shapes assigned to them such as ankoku butoh or dairakudakan s technique work but rather that butoh is a certain state of mind or feeling that influences the body directly or indirectly hijikata did in fact stress feeling through form in his dance saying life catches up with form which in no way suggests that his dance was mere form ohno kazuo though comes from the other direction form comes of itself only insofar as there is a spiritual content to begin with the trend towards form is apparent in several japanese dance groups who merely recycle hijikata s shapes and present butoh that is mere body shapes and choreography which would lead butoh closer to contemporary dance or performance art than anything else a good example of this is torifune butoh sha s recent works a paragraph from butoh dancer iwana masaki whose work shies away from all elements of choreography i have never heard of a butoh dancer entering a competition every butoh performance itself is an ultimate expression there are not and cannot be second or third places if butoh dancers were content with less than the ultimate they would not be actually dancing butoh for real butoh like real life itself cannot be given rankings critic mark holborn has written that butoh is defined by its very evasion of definition the kyoto journal variably categorizes butoh as dance theater kitchen or seditious act the san francisco examiner describes butoh as unclassifiable  the san francisco weekly adds the category of a kind of world of restaurant theater in a skid row context the sf weekly article entitled the bizarre world of butoh was about former sushi restaurant country station in which koichi tamano was chef and hiroko tamano manager the article begins there s a dirty corner of mission street where a sushi restaurant called country station shares space with hoodlums and homeless drunks a restaurant so camouflaged by dark and filth it easily escapes notice but when the restaurant is full and bustling there is a kind of theater that happens inside butoh frequently occurs in areas of extremes of the human condition such as skid rows or extreme physical environments such as a cave with no audience remote japanese cemetery or hanging by ropes from a skyscraper in front of the washington monument hiroko tamano considers modelling for artists to be botoh in which she poses in impossible positions held for hours which she calls really slow butoh the tamano s home seconds as a dance studio with any room or portion of yard potentially used when a completely new student arrived for a workshop in 1989 and found a chaotic simultaneous photo shoot dress rehearsal for a performance at berkeley s zellerbach hall workshop costume making session lunch chat and newspaper interview all choreographed into one event by hiroko tamano she ordered the student in broken english do interview the new student was interviewed without informing the reporter that the student had no knowledge as to what butoh was the improvised information was published defining butoh for the area public hiroko tamano then informed the student that the interview itself was butoh and that was the lesson such seditious acts or pranks in the context of chaos are butoh teachers influenced by more hijikata style approaches tend to use highly elaborate visulizations that can be highly mimetic theatrical and expressive a good example of this teaching would be koichi and hiroko tamano founders of harupin ha butoh dance company teachers who have spent time with ohno seem to be much more eclectic and individual in approach bearing the mark of their master perhaps in tendencies to indulge in wistful states of spiritualized semi embodiment there have however been many unique groups and performance companies influenced by the movements created by hijikata and ohno ranging from the highly minimalist of sankai juku to very theatrically explosive and carnivalesque performance of groups like dai rakudakan many nikkei such as japanese canadians jay hirabayashi of kokoro dance denise fujiwara incorporate butoh in their dance or have launched butoh dance troupes butoh is also created and performed by non japanese canadians thomas anfield and kevin bergsma formed butoh a go go in 1999 billing it a second generation butoh performance company anfield and bergsma met in 1995 working with kokoro dance numerous butoh companies exist outside of japan in europe asia and north and south america the multimedia physical theater oriented group called ink boat in san francisco incorporates humor into their work the swedish su en butoh company tours europe extensively one of the most prominent butoh influenced performers is the american dancer maureen fleming 
broken social scene are a juno award winning canadian indie rock band a musical collective currently including nineteen members formed in 1999 by kevin drew and brendan canning all of its members currently play in various other groups and solo projects mainly based around the city of toronto the band refuses the label supergroup based on size or the ubiquity of their members claiming that in the indie scene everyone is involved in more than one project the group s sound could be considered a combination of all of its members respective musical projects and is usually identified as baroque pop it is characterized by a very large number of sounds grand orchestrations featuring guitars horns woodwinds and violins unusual song structures and an experimental and sometimes chaotic production style from david newfeld the band s core members are kevin drew and brendan canning this duo recorded and released the band s ambient debut album feel good lost on noise factory records in 2001 with contributions by justin peroff charles spearin and bill priddle however when they played shows to support the album drew and canning found it difficult to put together an entertaining show based on feel good lost which was an almost entirely instrumental album as a result they brought in a number of friends from the toronto indie scene andrew whiteman jason collett leslie feist and metric s emily haines to flesh out their live show with lyrics and vocals over time the band also came to include contributions from james shaw justin peroff john crossingham stars torquil campbell evan cranley and amy millan all of the later guest musicians joined with drew canning peroff and spearin to record the band s second album you forgot it in people the album won the alternative album of the year juno award in 2003 the album also included musical contributions by priddle jessica moss brodie west susannah brady and ohad benchetrit but these were credited as supporting musicians rather than band members on the supporting tour the core band consisted of drew canning peroff whiteman and jason collett along with any other band member who was available to attend any individual show in 2003 the b sides and remix collection bee hives was released broken social scene released their third full length broken social scene on october 4 2005 with new contributors including k os jason tait and murray lightburn the inside booklet accompanying album also noted several new faces as part of broken social scene a limited edition ep e p to be you and me was also printed along with the album david newfeld who has produced broken social scene s albums is listed as a band member for the first time the group appeared on late night with conan o brien on january 31 2006 performing 7 4 at the 2006 juno awards they performed ibi dreams of pavement at the show and their eponymous album won the alternative album of the year award in july 2006 the band announced a temporary hiatus following the conclusion of their november us tour while members work on their other projects broken social scene s song lover s spit from 2002 s you forgot it in people has been featured in director clément virgo s movie lie with me paul mcguigan s wicker park bruce mcdonald s the love crimes of gillian guess showtime s queer as folk and the penultimate episode of the canadian series terminal city the version of lover s spit found on 2004 s bee hives record was also featured in an episode of the third season of the fx series nip tuck showtime s television program the l word featured pacific theme looks just like the sun both from you forgot it in people in the show s first season stars and sons from you forgot it in people also appeared in the movie the invisible music from the band s albums were used to score the 2006 film half nelson they have also composed and recorded an original score for the canadian film snow cake broken social scene also scored the 2007 film adaptation of maureen medved s novel the tracey fragments broken social scene were last minute replacement performers at north america s first virgin festival at toronto islands park the weekend of september 9 10 2006

close the festival sunday night appearing on the main virgin mobile stage immediately following performances by international superstar bands the strokes and the raconteurs bss took the stage at 10 00 p m and played a set of over an hour through the performance the band was joined by part time members and stars in their own right leslie feist amy millan of stars k os and emily haines of metric this was the last show featuring the rare 15 member lineup of the band in late 2006 several members of the band appeared as special guests on the stars and suns sessions the second album from mexican indie band chikita violenta the album was produced by dave newfeld in 2008 justin peroff contributed a t shirt design to the yellow bird project on behalf of the band to raise money for lake ontario

the rolling stones are an english rock band formed in 1962 in london when multi instrumentalist brian jones and pianist ian stewart were joined by vocalist mick jagger and guitarist keith richards

road manager and keyboardist until his death in 1985 jagger and richards early on formed the songwriting partnership jagger richards and gradually took over leadership of the band from the increasingly troubled and erratic jones at first the group recorded mainly covers of american blues and r b songs but since the 1966 album aftermath their releases have mainly featured jagger richards songs mick taylor replaced an incapacitated jones shortly before jones s death in 1969 taylor quit in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by faces guitarist ronnie wood who has remained with the band ever

stones were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame and in 2004 they were ranked number 4 in rolling stone magazine s 100 greatest artists of all time their image of unkempt and surly youth is

sidcup art college richards recalled i was still going to school and he was going up to the london school of economics so i get on this train one morning and there s jagger and under his arm he has four or five albums he s got chuck berry and muddy waters with mutual friend dick taylor they formed the band little boy blue and the blue boys stones founders brian jones and pianist ian stewart were active in the london r b scene fostered by cyril davies and alexis korner jagger and richards met jones while he was playing slide guitar sitting in with korner s blues incorporated korner also had hired jagger periodically and frequently future stones drummer charlie watts their first rehearsal was organised by jones and included stewart jagger and richards the latter came along at jagger s

for what became an eight month residency a young ex publicist of the beatles andrew loog oldham signed the band to a management deal with his partner and veteran booker eric easton in early may 1963 george harrison meanwhile encouraged decca records dick rowe who famously passed on the beatles to scout the rolling stones the band toured the uk in july 1963 and played their first gig outside of

training ground for the young band s stagecraft prior to this tour in july 1963 the band s first single chuck berry s come on reached number 21 in the uk in november 1963 the rolling stones had a bigger hit with a rendition of the lennon mccartney composition i wanna be your man which went to number 12 on the uk charts oldham crafted the band s image of long haired tearaways into the opposite of what the beatles doing the band was touring the uk constantly and made numerous television appearances their next single a frantic cover of buddy holly s not fade away was a top three hit their first album the rolling stones was composed primarily of covers drawn from the band s live repertoire the lp also included a jagger richards original tell me  and two numbers credited to nanker phelge the name used for songs composed by the entire group the rolling stones first us tour in june 1964 was in bill wyman s words a disaster when we arrived we didn t have a hit record or anything going for us when the band appeared on dean martin s tv variety show the hollywood palace martin mocked both their hair and their performance during the tour however they did a two day recording session at chess studios in chicago where many of their musical heroes recorded these sessions included what would become the rolling stones first uk chart topper their cover of bobby and shirley womack s it s all over now on their second us tour in the autumn of 1964 the band immediately followed james brown in the filmed theatrical release of the tami show which showcased american acts with british invasion artists according to jagger in 2003 we weren t actually following james brown because there were hours in between the filming of each section nevertheless he was still very annoyed about it  on 25 october the band also appeared on the ed sullivan show sullivan reacting to the pandemonium the stones caused promised to never book them again though he later did book them repeatedly their second lp the us only 12 x 5 was released during this tour it again contained mainly cover tunes augmented by jagger richards and nanker phelge tracks the rolling stones fifth uk single a cover of willie dixon s little red rooster backed by off the hook  was released in november 1964 and became their second number 1 hit in the uk an unprecedented achievement for a blues number the band s us

backed with what a shame heart of stone went to number 19 in the us the band s second uk lp the rolling stones no 2 released in january 1965 was another 1 on the album charts the us version released in february as the rolling stones now went to 5 most of the material had been recorded at chess studios in chicago and rca studios in los angeles in january february 1965 the band also toured australia and new zealand for the first time playing 34 shows for about 100 000 fans the first jagger richards composition to reach number 1 on the uk singles charts was the last time it went to

international number 1 single get off of my cloud was released in the autumn of 1965 followed by another us only lp december s children the release aftermath in the late spring of 1966 was the first rolling stones album to be composed entirely of jagger richards songs jones s contribution was also at its all time height with his command of exotic instruments greatly adding to the band s sound the american version of the lp included the chart topping middle eastern influenced paint it black the ballad lady jane and the almost 12 minute long going home the first extended jam on a top selling rock roll album later jimi hendrix cream and other sixties and seventies bands would release long jams routinely the stones success on the british and american singles charts peaked during 1966 19th nervous breakdown was followed by their first trans atlantic 1 hit paint it black  mother s little helper was only released as a single in the usa where it reached 8 it was one of the first pop songs to address the issue of prescription drug abuse and is also notable for the fact that jagger sang the lyric in his natural london accent rather than his usual affected southern american accent the sep 1966 single have you seen your mother baby standing in the shadow was notable in several respects it was the first stones recording to feature brass in the arrangement the back cover photo on the original us picture sleeve depicted the group satirically dressed in drag and the song was accompanied by one of the first purpose made promotional film clips directed by peter whitehead january 1967 saw the release of between the buttons the album was andrew oldham s last venture as the rolling stones producer the us version included the double a side single let s spend the night together and ruby tuesday which went to 1 in america and 3 in the uk when the band went to new york to perform the numbers on the ed sullivan show jagger changed the lyrics in the refrain to let s spend some time together to avoid having their appearance on the show cancelled jagger richards and jones now began to be hounded by authorities over their recreational drug use in early 1967 news of the world ran a three part feature entitled pop stars and drugs facts that will shock you which carried allegations of lsd parties hosted by the moody blues and attended by top stars including the who s pete townshend and cream s ginger baker and alleged admissions of drug use by leading pop musicians the first article targeted donovan the second installment targeted the rolling stones a reporter who contributed to the story spent an evening at the exclusive london club blaise s where a member of the stones allegedly took several benzedrine tablets displayed a piece of hashish and invited his companions back to his flat for a smoke the article claimed that this was mick jagger but it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity the reporter had in fact been eavesdropping on brian jones on the night the article was published jagger appeared on the eammon andrews chat show and announced that he was filing a writ of libel against the paper a week later on sunday 12 february sussex police raided a party at keith richards s home redlands no arrests were made at the time but jagger richards and their friend art dealer robert fraser were subsequently charged with drug offences richards said in 2003 when we got busted at redlands it suddenly made us realise that this was a whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped up until then it had been as though london existed in a beautiful space where you could do anything you wanted in march while awaiting the consequences of the police raid jagger richards and jones decided to take a short trip to morocco accompanied by marianne faithfull jones s girlfriend anita pallenberg and other friends during this trip the stormy relations between jones and pallenberg deteriorated to the point that pallenberg left morocco with richards richards said later that was the final nail in the coffin with me and brian he d never forgive me for that and i don t blame him but hell shit happens richards and pallenberg would remain a couple for twelve years despite these complications the rolling stones toured europe in march and april 1967 the tour included the band s first performances in poland greece and italy on 9 may 1967 the same day jagger richards and fraser were arraigned in connection with the redlands charges brian jones s house was raided by police and he was arrested and charged with possession of cannabis with three out of five rolling stones now facing criminal charges jagger and richards were tried at the end of june on 29 june they were both convicted and given prison sentences they were released on bail the following day pending appeal the times ran the famous editorial entitled who breaks a butterfly on a wheel in which editor william rees mogg was strongly critical of the sentencing pointing out that jagger had been treated far more harshly for a minor first offence than any purely anonymous young man while awaiting the appeal hearings the band recorded a new single we love you as a thank you for the loyalty shown by their fans it began with the sound of prison doors closing and the accompanying music video included allusions to the trial of oscar wilde in july the appeals court overturned richards conviction and jagger s sentence was reduced to a conditional discharge brian jones s trial took place in november 1967 in december after appealing the original prison sentence jones was fined 1000 put on three years probation and ordered to seek professional help december 1967 also saw the release of their satanic majesties request released shortly after the beatles sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band satanic majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while jagger richards and jones were dealing with their court cases the band parted ways with producer andrew oldham during the sessions the split was amicable at least publicly but in 2003 jagger said the reason andrew left was because he thought that we weren t concentrating and that we were being childish it was not a great moment really and i would have thought it wasn t a great moment for andrew either there were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point that was andrew s job satanic majesties thus became the first album the rolling stones produced on their own it was also the first of their albums released in identical versions on both sides of the atlantic its psychedelic sound was complemented by the cover art which featured a 3d photo by michael cooper who had also photographed the cover of sgt pepper bill wyman wrote and sang a track on the album in another land which was also released as the first the rolling stones single featuring lead vocals other than jagger s the band spent the first few months of 1968 working on material for their next album those sessions resulted in the song jumpin jack flash released as a single in may the song and later that year the resulting album beggars banquet marked the band s return to their blues roots and the beginning of their collaboration with producer jimmy miller featuring the album s lead single street fighting man and the opening track sympathy for the devil beggars banquet was another eclectic mix of country and blues inspired tunes and was hailed as an achievement for the stones at the time of release on the musical evolution between albums richards said there is a change between material on satanic majesties and beggars banquet i d grown sick to death of the whole maharishi guru shit and the beads and bells who knows where these things come from but i guess was a reaction to what we d done in our time off and also that severe dose of reality a spell in prison will certainly give you room for thought i was fucking pissed with being busted so it was right we ll go and strip this thing down there s a lot of anger in the music from that period tutored by american guitarist ry cooder richards during this time started using open tunings most prominently an open e or open d tuning then in 1969 5 string open g tuning as heard on the 1969 single honky tonk women brown sugar  tumbling dice happy and start me up open tunings led to the stones trademark guitar sound the end of 1968 saw the filming of the rolling stones rock and roll circus it featured john lennon yoko ono the dirty mac the who jethro tull marianne faithfull and taj mahal the footage was shelved for twenty eight years but was finally released officially in 1996 by the release of beggars banquet brian jones was troubled and contributing only sporadically to the band jagger said that jones was not psychologically suited to this way of life his drug use had become a hindrance and he was unable to obtain a us visa richards reported that in a june meeting with jagger richards and watts at jones s house jones admitted that he was unable to go on the road again according to richards all agreed to let jones  say i ve left and if i want to i can come back his replacement was the 20 year old guitarist mick taylor of john mayall s bluesbreakers who started recording with the band immediately on 3 july 1969 less than a month later jones drowned in the swimming pool at his cotchford farm home in sussex the rolling stones were scheduled to play at a free concert in london s hyde park two days after brian jones s death they decided to proceed with the show as a tribute to jones their first concert with mick taylor was performed in front of an estimated 250 000 fans the performance was filmed by a granada television production team to be shown on british television as stones in the park jagger read an excerpt from percy bysshe shelley s elegy adonais and released thousands of butterflies in memory of jones the show included the concert debut of honky tonk women which the band had just released their stage manager sam cutler introduced them as the greatest rock roll band in the world a description he repeated throughout their 1969 us tour and which has stuck to this day the release of let it bleed came in december their last album of the sixties let it bleed featured gimmie shelter  you can t always get what you want midnight rambler as well as a cover of robert johnson s love in vain jones and taylor are featured on two tracks each many of these numbers were played during the band s us tour in november 1969 their first in three years just after the tour the band also staged the altamont free concert at the altamont speedway about 60 km east of san francisco the biker gang hells angels provided security which resulted in a fan meredith hunter being stabbed and beaten to death by the angels part of the tour and the altamont concert were documented in albert and david maysles film gimme shelter as a response to the growing popularity of bootleg recordings the album get yer ya yas out was released in 1970 it was declared by critic lester bangs to be the best live album ever in 1970 the band s contracts with both allen klein and decca records ended and amid contractual disputes with klein they formed their own record company rolling stones records sticky fingers released in march 1971 the band s first album on their own label featured an elaborate cover design by andy warhol the album contains one of their best known hits brown sugar and the country influenced wild horses both were recorded at alabama s muscle shoals sound studio during the 1969 american tour the album continued the band s immersion into heavily blues influenced compositions the album is noted for its loose ramshackle ambience and marked mick taylor s first full release with the band following the release of sticky fingers the rolling stones left england on the advice of financial advisors the band moved to the south of france where richards rented the villa nellcôte and sublet rooms to band members and entourage using the rolling stones mobile studio they held recording sessions in the basement they completed the resulting tracks along with material dating as far back as 1969 at sunset studios in los angeles the resulting double album exile on main st was released in may 1972 given an a grade by critic robert christgau and disparaged by lester bangs who reversed his opinion within months exile is now accepted as one of the stones best albums the films cocksucker blues and ladies and gentlemen the rolling stones document the subsequent highly publicised 1972 north american tour with its retinue of jet set hangers on including writer terry southern in november 1972 the band began sessions in kingston jamaica for their follow up to exile goats head soup the album spawned the worldwide hit angie but proved the first in a string of commercially successful but tepidly received studio albums the sessions for goats head soup led to a number of outtakes most notably an early version of the popular ballad waiting on a friend not released until tattoo you eight years later the making of the record was interrupted by another legal battle over drugs dating back to their stay in france a warrant for richards arrest had been issued and the other band members had to return briefly to france for questioning this along with jagger s convictions on drug charges also complicated the band s plans for their pacific tour in early 1973 they were denied permission to play in japan and almost banned from australia this was followed by a european tour in september october 1973 prior to which richards had been arrested once more on drug charges this time in england the band went to musicland studios in munich to record their next album 1974 s it s only rock n roll but jimmy miller who had drug abuse issues was no longer producer instead jagger and richards assumed production duties and were credited as the glimmer twins both the album and the single of the same name were hits nearing the end of 1974 taylor began to get impatient the band s situation made normal functioning complicated with band members living in different countries and legal barriers restricting where they could tour at the same time richards drug use was affecting his creativity and productivity while taylor felt some of his own creative contributions were going unrecognized at the end of 1974 with a recording session already booked in munich to record another album taylor quit the rolling stones taylor said in 1980 i was getting a bit fed up i wanted to broaden my scope as a guitarist and do something else i wasn t really composing songs or writing at that time i was just beginning to write and that influenced my decision there are some people who can just ride along from crest to crest they can ride along somebody else s success and there are some people for whom that s not enough it really wasn t enough for me the stones used the recording sessions in munich to audition replacements for taylor guitarists as stylistically far flung as humble pie lead peter frampton and ex yardbirds virtuoso jeff beck were auditioned rory gallagher and shuggie otis also dropped by the munich sessions american session players wayne perkins and harvey mandel also appeared on much of the next album yet richards and jagger also wanted the stones to remain purely a british band when ron wood walked in and jammed with the band richards and everyone else knew he was the one wood had already recorded and played live with richards and had contributed to the recording and writing of the track it s only rock n roll the album black and blue featured all their contributions though he had earlier declined jagger s offer to join the stones because of his ties to the the faces wood committed to the stones in 1975 for their upcoming tour of the americas he joined officially the following year as the faces dissolved however wood remained on salary until wyman s departure nearly two decades later when he finally became a full member of the rolling stones partnership the 1975 tour of the americas kicked off with the band performing on a flatbed trailer being pulled down broadway in new york city the tour featured stage props including a giant phallus and a rope on which jagger swung out over the audience jagger had booked a live recording session at the el mocambo club in toronto to balance a long overdue live album 1977 s love you live the first stones live album since 1970 s get yer ya ya s out richards addiction to heroin delayed his arrival in toronto the other members had already assembled awaiting richards and sent him a telegram asking him where he was on 24 february 1977 richards and his family flew in from london on a direct boac flight and were detained by canada customs after richards was found in possession of a burnt spoon and hash residue on 4 march richards partner anita pallenberg pleaded guilty to drug possession and was fined for the original airport event on sunday 27 february after two days of stones rehearsals armed with an arrest warrant for pallenberg the royal canadian mounted police discovered 22 grams of heroin in richards room richards was charged with importing narcotics into canada which carried a minimum seven year sentence upon conviction later the crown prosecutor conceded that richards had procured the drugs after arrival despite the arrest the band played two shows in toronto only to raise more controversy when margaret trudeau then wife of canadian prime minister pierre trudeau was seen partying with the band after the show these two shows were kept secret from the public and the el mocambo had been booked for the entire week by april wine for a recording session 1050 chum a local radio station ran a contest for free tickets to see april wine and the winners were allowed to pick a night to see the band the winners that picked tickets for the friday or saturday night were surprised to find that the stones were playing the drug case dragged on for over a year until richards received a suspended sentence and was ordered to play two free concerts for the cnib in oshawa both shows were played by the rolling stones and the new barbarians a group that wood had put together to promote his latest solo album and which richards also joined this episode motivated richards resolve to end his drug habit it also coincided with the end of his relationship with pallenberg which had become strained since the death of their third child and her inability to curb her heroin addiction while keith struggled to get clean while richards was settling his legal and personal problems jagger continued his jet set lifestyle he was a regular at new york s studio 54 disco club often in the company of model jerry hall his marriage to bianca jagger ended in 1977 although the rolling stones remained popular through the first half of the 1970s music critics had grown increasingly dismissive of the band s output and record sales failed to meet expectations by the late 70s punk rock had become influential and the stones were criticised as decadent aging millionaires and their music considered by many to be stagnant or irrelevant this changed in 1978 when the band released some girls which included the hit single miss you the country ballad far away eyes beast of burden and shattered in part a response to punk many songs were fast basic guitar driven rock and roll the album s success re established the stones immense popularity among young people the band guested on the first show of the fourth season of the tv series saturday night live after the us tour 1978 the group did not tour europe the following year breaking the routine of touring europe every three years that the band had followed since 1967 entering the 1980s on a renewed commercial high with the success of some girls the band released their next album emotional rescue in mid 1980 the recording of the album was reportedly plagued by turmoil with jagger and richards relationship reaching a new low richards more sober than during the previous ten years began to assert more control in the studio more than jagger had become used to and a struggle ensued as richards felt he was fighting for his half of the glimmer twins though emotional rescue hit the top of the charts on both sides of the atlantic it was panned by critics as lackluster and inconsistent in early 1981 the group reconvened and decided to tour the us that year leaving little time to write and record a new album as well as rehearse for the tour that year s resulting album tattoo you featured a number of outtakes including lead single start me up two songs featured mick taylor s guitar playing while jazz saxophonist sonny rollins played on slave and dubbed a part on waiting on a friend the stones american tour 1981 was their biggest longest and most colourful production to date with the band playing from 25 september through 19 december it was the highest grossing tour of that year some shows were recorded resulting in the 1982 live album still life and the 1983 hal ashby concert film let s spend the night together which was filmed at sun devil stadium in phoenix arizona and the brendan byrne arena in the meadowlands new jersey in mid 1982 to commemorate their 20th anniversary the stones took their american stage show to europe the european tour 1982 was their first european tour in six years the tour was essentially a carbon copy of the 1981 american tour for the tour the band were joined by former allman brothers band piano player chuck leavell who continues to play and record with the stones by the end of the year the band had signed a new four album 28 million dollar recording deal with a new label cbs records before leaving atlantic the stones released undercover in late 1983 despite good reviews the record sold below expectations and there was no tour to support it subsequently the stones new marketer distributor cbs records took over distributing the stone s atlantic catalogue by this time the jagger richards split was growing jagger had signed a solo deal with cbs to be distributed by columbia much to the consternation of richards jagger spent much of 1984 writing songs for his first solo effort and as he admitted he began to feel stultified within the framework of the rolling stones by 1985 jagger was spending more time on solo recordings and much of the material on 1986 s dirty work was generated by keith richards with more contributions by ron wood than on previous rolling stones albums rumours surfaced that jagger and richards were rarely if ever in the studio at the same time leaving richards to keep the recording sessions moving forward in december 1985 the band s co founder pianist road manager and long time friend ian stewart died of a heart attack the rolling stones played a private tribute concert for him at london s 100 club in february 1986 two days before they were presented with a grammy lifetime achievement award dirty work came out in march 1986 to mixed reviews jagger refused to tour to promote the album stating later that several band members were in no condition to tour richards was infuriated when jagger instead undertook his own solo tour he has referred to this period in his relations with jagger as world war iii jagger s solo records she s the boss and primitive cool met with moderate success although richards disparaged both with the rolling stones inactive richards released his first solo album in 1988 talk is cheap it was well received by fans and critics going gold in the us in early 1989 the rolling stones including mick taylor ronnie wood and ian stewart were inducted into the american rock and roll hall of fame jagger and richards appeared to have set animosities aside and the rolling stones went to work on the album that would be called steel wheels heralded as a return to form it included the singles mixed emotions rock and a hard place and almost hear you sigh the album also included continental drift recorded in tangier in 1989 with bachir attar and the master musicians of jajouka whom brian jones had recorded in 1968 the subsequent steel wheels urban jungle tours encompassing north america japan and europe saw the rolling stones touring for the first time in seven years and it

whom continue to tour regularly with the rolling stones recordings from the steel wheels urban jungle tours produced the 1991 concert album flashpoint which also included two studio tracks recorded in 1991 the single highwire and sex drive these were the last rolling stones tours for bill wyman who left the band after years of deliberation although his retirement was not made official until 1993 he then published stone alone an autobiography based on memoirs he had been writing since the band s early days in london a few years later he formed bill wyman s rhythm kings and began recording and touring again after the successes of the steel wheels urban jungle tours the band took a break charlie watts released two jazz albums ronnie wood made his fifth solo album the first in 11 years called

stone magazine the single streets of love reached the top 15 in uk and europe the album included the most controversial song from the stones in years sweet neo con a criticism of american neoconservatism from jagger the song was reportedly almost dropped from the album because of objections from richards when asked if he was afraid of political backlash such as the dixie chicks had endured for criticism of american involvement in the war in iraq richards responded that the album came first and that i don t want to be sidetracked by some little political storm in a teacup the subsequent a bigger bang tour began in august 2005 and visited north america south america and east asia in february 2006 the group played the half time show of super bowl xl in detroit michigan by

break before proceeding to europe during this break keith richards was hospitalized in new zealand for cranial surgery after a fall from a tree on fiji where he had been on holiday the incident led to a six week delay in launching the european leg of the tour in june 2006 it was reported that ronnie wood was continuing his programme of rehabilitation for alcohol abuse but this did not affect the rearranged european tour schedule two out of the 21 shows scheduled for july september 2006 were later cancelled due to mick jagger s throat problems the stones returned to north america for concerts

announced the rolling stones had made 437 million on the a bigger bang tour to list them in the latest edition of guinness world record mick jagger released a compilation of his solo work called the very best of mick jagger including three unreleased songs on 2 october 2007 on 12 november 2007 the double compilation rolled gold the very best of the rolling stones was re released for the christmas season as with the case of abkco records and their history of unofficial releases the actual band had nothing to do with the re release of the compilation keith richards sparked rumours that a new rolling stones studio album may be forthcoming saying during an interview following the premiere of shine a light i think we might make another album once we get over doing promotion on this film in july 2008 it was announced that the rolling stones were leaving emi and signing with vivendi s universal music taking with them their catalogue stretching back to sticky fingers new music released by the band while under this contract will be issued through universal s polydor label universal records will hold the us rights to the pre 1994 material while the post 1994 material will be handled by interscope records the rolling stones are notable in modern popular music for assimilating various musical genres into their recording and performance ultimately making the styles their very own the band s career is marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles like american blues country folk reggae dance world music exemplified by the master musicians of jajouka as well as traditional english styles that use stringed instrumentation like harps the band cut their musical teeth by covering early rock and roll and blues songs and have never stopped playing live or recording cover songs often the first instances of this come through the stones use of a blues based r b sound jagger and richards shared interest in the americans jimmy reed muddy waters and little walter were influential on the band s leader brian jones of whom richards says he was more into t bone walker and jazz blues stuff we d turn him onto chuck berry and say look it s all the same shit man and you can do it charlie watts a traditional jazz drummer was also turned onto the blues after his introduction to the stones keith and brian turned me on to jimmy reed and people like that i learned that earl phillips was playing on those records like a jazz drummer playing swing with a straight four jagger recalling when he first heard the likes of chuck berry bo diddley muddy waters fats domino and other heavies of the american blues scene said it seemed the most real thing he had heard up to that point similarly keith richards describing the first time he listened to muddy waters said it was the most powerful music ever heard the most expressive despite the stones predilection for blues and r b numbers on their early live setlists the first original compositions by the band reflected a more wide ranging interest the first jagger richards single tell me is called by critic richie unterberger a pop rock ballad when began to write songs they were usually not derived from the blues but were often surprisingly fey slow mersey type pop numbers as tears go by the ballad originally written for marianne faithfull was one of the first songs written by jagger and richards and also one of many written by the duo for other artists jagger said of the song it s a relatively mature song considering the rest of the output at the time and we didn t think of it because the rolling stones were a butch blues group the stones did later record a version which became a top five hit in the us on the early experience richards said the amazing thing is that although mick and i thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten time every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts that gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on because at the beginning songwriting was something we were going to do in order to say to andrew well at least we gave it a try jagger said we were very pop orientated we didn t sit around listening to muddy waters we listened to everything in some ways it s easy to write to order keith and i got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes they were done in ten minutes i think we thought it was a bit of a laugh and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us the writing of the single the last time the stones first major single proved a turning point richards called it a bridge into thinking about writing for the stones it gave us a level of confidence a pathway of how to do it built around a riff played by brian jones the song was based on a traditional gospel song popularised by the staples singers and would be emblematic of the heavily guitar based sound to come withwithofficially released films featuring the rolling stones are listed with their original release dates the officially unreleased 1972 film cocksucker blues is available from various sources on the internet in various formats

u s and other international audiences the band s international breakthrough came with the third album travelling without moving in 1996 which yielded two big hits virtual insanity and cosmic girl the

zanzibar is part of the east african republic of tanzania it consists of the zanzibar archipelago in the indian ocean 25 50 km off the coast of the mainland there are numerous small islands and two large ones unguja and pemba zanzibar was once a separate state with a long trading history within the arab world it united with tanganyika to form tanzania in 1964 and still enjoys a high degree of autonomy within the union the capital of zanzibar located on the island of unguja is zanzibar city and its old quarter known as stone town is a world heritage site zanzibar s main industries are spices raffia and tourism it is still sometimes referred to as the spice islands because of the significance of its production of cloves nutmeg cinnamon and pepper zanzibar s ecology is of note for being the home of the endemic zanzibar red colobus and the zanzibar leopard the word zanzibar probably derives from the persian زنگبار zangi bar the presence of microlithic tools attests to 20 000 years of human occupation of zanzibar the islands became part of the historical record of the wider world when arab traders discovered them and used them as a base for voyages between arabia india and africa unguja offered a protected and defensible harbour so although the archipelago offered few products of value the arabs settled at what became zanzibar city as a convenient point from which to trade with east african coastal towns they established garrisons on the islands and built the first mosque in the southern hemisphere during the age of exploration the portuguese empire was the first european power to gain control of zanzibar and the portugese kept it for nearly 200 years in 1698 zanzibar fell under the control of the sultanate of oman which developed an economy of trade and cash crops with a ruling arab elite plantations were developed to grow spices hence the name of the spice islands another major trade good for zanzibar was ivory the third pillar of the economy was slavery giving zanzibar an important place in the arab slave trade the indian ocean equivalent of the better known triangular trade zanzibar city was the main trading port of the east african slave trade with about 50 000 slaves a year passing through the city the sultan of zanzibar controlled a substantial portion of the east african coast known as zanj this included mombasa dar es salaam and trading routes that extended much further inland such as the route leading to kindu on the congo river sometimes gradually and sometimes by fits and starts control of zanzibar came into the hands of the british empire part of the political impetus for this was the 19th century movement for the abolition of the slave trade the relationship between britain and the nearest relevant colonial power germany was formalized by the 1890 helgoland zanzibar treaty in which germany pledged not to interfere with british interests in insular zanzibar that year zanzibar became a protectorate of britain from 1890 to 1913 traditional viziers were appointed to govern as puppets switching to a system of british residents from 1913 to 1963 the death of one sultan and the succession of another of whom the british did not approve led to the anglo zanzibar war on the morning of 27 august 1896 ships of the royal navy destroyed the beit al hukum palace a cease fire was declared 38 minutes later and the bombardment subsequently became known as the shortest war in history the islands gained independence from britain in december 1963 as a constitutional monarchy a month later the bloody zanzibar revolution in which thousands of arabs and indians were killed in a genocide and thousands more expelled led to the establishment of the republic of zanzibar and pemba that april the republic was subsumed by the mainland former colony of tanganyika this united republic of tanganyika and zanzibar was soon renamed the united republic of tanzania of which zanzibar remains a semi autonomous region zanzibar has many animal species from the african mainland who traveled from the mainland during the last ice age these included the zanzibar leopard which is critically endangered and possibly extinct this article is part of the series

zanzibar central south zanzibar north and zanzibar urban west pemba has two pemba north and pemba south there are many political parties in zanzibar but the main parties are the chama cha mapinduzi and the civic united front known as chama cha wananchi the party s name has been associated as the swahili translation of civic united front though it has different meanings chama cha wananchi means peoples party in english and not civic united front as many think since the early 1990s the politics of the archipelago have been marked by repeated clashes between these two political parties contested elections in late 2000 led to a massacre in zanzibar in january 2001 when the government shot into crowds of protestors killing 35 and injuring 600 violence erupted again in 2005 after another contested election with the cuf claiming that its rightful victory had been stolen from them following 2005 negotiations between the two parties aiming at the long term resolution of the tensions and a power sharing accord took place but they suffered repeated setbacks the most notable of these took place in april 2008 when the cuf walked away from the negotiating table following a ccm call for a referendum to approve of what had been presented as a done deal on the power sharing agreement zanzibar mainly pemba island was once the world s leading clove producer during the 1970s but annual clove sales have since plummeted by 80 explanations given for this are a fast moving global market international competition and a hangover from tanzania s failed experiment with socialism in the 1960s and 70s when the government controlled clove prices and exports zanzibar now ranks a distant third with indonesia supplying 75 of the world s cloves zanzibar exports spices seaweed and fine raffia it also has a large fishing and dugout canoe production tourism is a major foreign currency earner during may and june 2008 zanzibar suffered a major failure of its electricity system which left the island without mains electricity for nearly a month the mainland where the fault originated managed to be restored at the same time but the islanders stayed powerless and entirely dependent on alternative methods of electricity generation from may 21 to june 19 this led to a serious and ongoing shock to the island s fragile economy generally zanzibaris live in worse conditions than in mainland tanzania most people in zanzibar subsist on incomes of less than us 50 per day with tourism being the only major provider of employment some foreign embassies have relocated to zanzibar to serve both zanzibaris and their own citizens who find it hard to travel to dar es salaam for consular services zanzibar has a total road network of 1 600 kilometers of roads of which 85

served by the newly restructured public telecommunication company and 4 private owned mobile systems through these systems the whole of zanzibar is widely covered and connected to most parts of the world the energy sector in zanzibar is constituted by electric power petroleum and petroleum products it is also supplemented by firewood and its related products coal and gas is rarely used for both

of the tanzanian mainland compulsory education in zanzibar is from standard one to form two while on the mainland it is from standard one to seven the national examination of tanzania is shared by both mainland and zanzibar during o level education fewer students from zanzibar pass the exam than students from the mainland in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s national service after secondary education

kidichi features the hammam built by immigrants from shiraz iran during the reign of barghash bin said zanzibar was the first region in africa to introduce color television in 1973 though currently

fleet foxes are a five piece seattle based band signed to sub pop and bella union the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second ep sun giant and their debut full length album fleet foxes both sun giant and their eponymous debut album received much critical praise and reviewers often noted their use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies the quintet describe their music as baroque harmonic pop jams robin pecknold and skyler skjelset both attended lake washington high school in kirkland a suburb of seattle and soon became close friends the confident character of pecknold stood in contrast with skjelset s shy demeanor but the two bonded over a mutual appreciation of bob dylan and neil young and began making music together their parents influenced their musical tastes early on skjelset s mother was a keen listener of both bob dylan and hank williams while pecknold s father was a member of the fathoms a local 1960s soul group the two young seattleites were ambitious and pecknold reflecting on the achievements of dylan and brian wilson realized the importance of practicing music from a young age originally going by the name pineapple a name clash with another local band prompted a change and pecknold decided upon fleet foxes suggesting that it was evocative of some weird english activity like fox hunting pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter both singing and playing guitar while skjelset played lead guitar pecknold s late sixties pop style caught the attention of seattle producer phil ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006 the self released fleet foxes ep ek was impressed with the band s songwriting and upon hearing pecknold for the first time was interested in his zombies esque music noting that it was obvious that he had talent coming out of his ass by late 2006 the seattle press began to take notice of the band tom scanlon of the seattle times stated that he was impressed with the band s lyrics and musical maturity with growing popularity on the local circuit and a wealth of song material the band set about making their first album in early 2007 spending time in the studio with producer ek in addition to recording material at home however funds for recording were tight limiting the time they had in the studio and the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members apartments or the basement of pecknold s parents house fleet foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007 they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their myspace site although the band had not released any of their recordings they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal signing with warner music subsidiary record label sub pop on january 18 2008 the band completed the recording of their second ep sun giant around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours fleet foxes began their spring tour with fellow northwest band blitzen trapper on february 28 2008 the band s performance at the sxsw festival in march 2008 moved the band into the public consciousness notably attracting attention from the european press for the first time sun giant was released internationally on april 8 2008 and the group s brand of folk rock and pop marked by their use of vocal harmonies was well received by the press despite the warm critical reception the group stated that the ep did not represent their full ambitions serving merely as a cd to sell while on tour in may 2008 the band chose to extend their north american and european tour until september in support of their forthcoming album additionally the band grew in number as songwriter j tillman joined fleet foxes on drums and back up vocals their debut full length album fleet foxes was released shortly afterwards on june 3 2008 the album achieved similar critical success as the previous ep had fleet foxes received four stars from rolling stone who compared it to the likes of the beach boys animal collective and crosby stills nash and a 9 0 out of 10 in a review by pitchfork the guardian was particularly complimentary awarding the album five stars and declaring it a landmark in american music an instant classic on june 24 2008 fleet foxes went to 1 on the cmj radio 200 chart the album achieved an average rating of 87 from 30 reviews on aggregator website metacritic placing it in the category of universal acclaim while the group enjoyed moderate success in the united states fleet foxes was better received in europe selling over 200 000 copies in the first five months following its release the sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won uncut s first ever music award 2008 prize uncut editor allan jones said that the album showed impeccable musicianship and though you could trace its antecedents it sounded totally unique fleet foxes was just a glorious debut the band sold out music venues for their tours of australia new zealand and the united kingdom reaffirming their growing popularity at the end of 2008 fleet foxes was rated album of the year by billboard s critic s choice and in metacritic s end of year best album round up it appeared in 17 lists topping six of them furthermore it had sold around 141 000 copies in north america and over 100 000 copies in the united kingdom making it the first gold certificate record for uk label bella union their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances playing on vincent moon s la blogotheque in december 2008 and on saturday night live the following january in february 2009 the band were reported to have turned down a contract offer from virgin records claiming that major record labels were anti music

also did graduate studies with melville j herskovits at columbia and with ray birdwhistell at the university of pennsylvania to some he is best known for his theories of cantometrics choreometrics and parlametrics elaborated from 1960 until his death with the help of collaborators victor grauer conrad arensberg forrestine paulay and roswell rudd from 1936 to 1942 lomax was assistant in charge of the archive of folk song of the library of congress to which he and his father and numerous collaborators contributed more than ten thousand field recordings during his lifetime he collected folk music from the united states haiti the caribbean ireland great britain spain and italy assembling a treasure trove of american and international culture a pioneering oral historian he also recorded

geer sonny terry pete seeger and fiddlin arthur smith among others was released on rounder records in 2000 he also produced recordings concerts and radio shows in the u s and in england which played an important role in both the american folk music revival and british folk revivals of the 1940s and 50s in the late 1940s he produced a highly regarded series of folk music albums for decca records and organized a series of concerts at new york s town hall and carnegie hall featuring blues calypso and flamenco music he also hosted a radio show your ballad man from 1945 49 that was broadcast nationwide on the mutual radio network and featured a highly eclectic program from gamelan music to django reinhardt to klezmer music to sidney bechet and wild bill davidson to jazzy pop songs by maxine waters and jo stafford to readings of the poetry of carl sandburg to hillbilly music with electric guitars to finnish brass bands to name a few lomax spent the 1950s based in london from where he edited the 18 volume columbia world library of folk and primitive music an anthology issued on newly invented lp records for the british and irish volumes he worked with the bbc and folklorists

1953 and 1954 with the cooperation of the bbc and the accademia di santa cecilia in rome helped capture a snapshot of a multitude of important traditional folk styles shortly before they disappeared the pair amassed one of the most representative folk song collections of any culture from lomax s spanish and italian recordings emerged one of the first theories explaining the types of folk singing that predominate in particular areas a theory that incorporates work style the environment and the degrees of social and sexual freedom upon his return to new york in 1959 lomax produced a concert folksong 59 in carnegie hall featuring arkansas singer jimmy driftwood the selah jubilee singers and drexel singers muddy waters and memphis slim the stony mountain boys pete seeger mike seeger and the cadillacs the occasion marked the first time rock and roll and bluegrass were performed on the carnegie hall stage the time has come for americans not to be ashamed of what we go for musically from primitive ballads to rock n roll songs lomax told the audience according to izzy young the audience booed when he told them to lay down their prejudices and listen to rock n roll in young s opinion lomax put on what is probably the turning point in american folk music  at that concert the point he was trying to make was that negro and white music were mixing and rock and roll was that thing alan lomax married elizabeth harold in february 1937 they were married for 12 years she assisted him in recording in haiti alabama appalachia and mississippi and who wrote radio scripts of folk operas featuring american music broadcast over the bbc as part of the war effort as well as conducting lengthy interviews with folk music personalities he also did important field work with elizabeth barnicle and zora neale hurston in florida and the bahamas with john work and lewis jones in mississippi with folksingers robin roberts and jean ritchie in ireland with his second wife antoinette marchand in the caribbean with joan halifax in morocco and with his daughter anna l chairetakis all those who assisted and worked with him were accurately credited on the resultant library of congress and other recordings as well as in his many books and publications alan lomax met twenty year old english folk singer shirley collins while living in london the two were romantically involved and lived together for some years when lomax obtained a contract from atlantic records to re record some the u s artists he had recorded in the 1940s using improved recording equipment collins accompanied him their folk song collecting trip to the southern states lasted from july to november 1959 and resulted in many hours of recordings featuring performers such as almeda riddle hobart smith and bessie jones and culminated in the discovery of mississippi fred mcdowell recordings from this trip were issued under the title sounds of the south and some were also featured in the coen brothers film oh brother where art thou lomax wanted to marry her but when their trip was over collins returned to england and instead married austin john marshall in an interview in the guardian newspaper friday march 21 2008 collins was miffed that alan lomax s 1993 history of blues music the land where the blues began barely mentioned her all it said was shirley collins was along for the trip it made me hopping mad i wasn t just along for the trip i was part of the recording process i made notes i drafted contracts i was involved in every part collins decided to rectify the perceived omission in her memoir america over the water published in 2004 collins described her arrival in america 1959 in an interview with johan kugelberg kugelberg lomax met you collins he was on the dockside with anne his daughter  i think i arrived in april and i don t think we went south until august it took quite a long time to get the money together it kept falling through i think columbia was going to pay for it at one point but they insisted he have a union engineer with him and someone extra like that that in situations we were going to be in would have been hopeless so he refused and they withdrew their funding it was very last minute that the ertegun brothers at atlantic gave us the cash and we were gone within days of getting that money alan had wanted to do it earlier but there was just no money to do it with he had no money ever he was always living hand to mouth kugelberg that s the nature of somebody who is making the path as he s going along also as a sidebar considering who the ertegun brothers were at that point in time it s surprising to me that they greenlighted that project at that point in time i love that series i think it s one of the great series of albums ever it s surprising that atlantic records made that leap of faith because the series is sort of outside of their paradigm so those months were spent in new york collins we went to another place actually we went to california to the california folk festival in berkeley this was sometime in the summer and we stopped off in chicago and stayed with who was a hospitable man and his wonderful hospitable wife caught the train out to san francisco from chicago which was an incredible experience sang at the berkeley festival and met jimmy driftwood there for the first time we all hit it off wonderfully kugelberg your friends in england were dying of envy collins no they didn t know lomax married antoinette marchand on august 26 1961 in 1962 lomax and singer and civil rights activist guy carawan music director at the highlander folk school in monteagle tennessee produced the album freedom in the air albany georgia 1961 62 on vanguard records for the student non violent coordinating committee lomax was a consultant to carl sagan for the voyager golden record sent into space on the 1977 voyager spacecraft to represent the music of the earth music he helped choose included the blues jazz and rock n roll of blind willie johnson louis armstrong and chuck berry andean panpipes and navajo chants a sicilian sulfur miner s lament polyphonic vocal music from the mbuti pygmies of zaire and the georgians of the caucasus and a shepherdess song from bulgaria by valya balkanska in addition to bach mozart and beethoven and more musician brian eno had this to say about lomax s later career turned his intelligent attentions to music from many other parts of the world securing for them a dignity and status they had not previously been accorded the world music phenomenon arose partly from those efforts as did his great book folk song style and culture i believe this is one of the most important books ever written about music in my all time top ten it is one of the very rare attempts to put cultural criticism onto a serious comprehensible and rational footing by someone who had the experience and breadth of vision to be able to do it as a member of the popular front and people s songs in the 1940s alan lomax promoted what was then known as one world and today is called multiculturalism in the late forties he produced a series of concerts at town hall and carnegie hall that presented flamenco guitar and calypso along with country blues appalachian music andean music and jazz his radio shows of the 40s and 50s explored musics of all the world s peoples lomax recognized that folklore occurs at the local and not the national level and flourishes not in isolation but in fruitful interplay with other cultures he was dismayed that mass communications appeared to be crushing local cultural expressions and languages in 1950 he echoed anthropologist bronisław malinowski who believed the role of the ethnologist should be that of advocate for primitive man when he urged folklorists to similarly advocate for the folk some such as richard dorson objected that scholars shouldn t act as cultural arbiters but lomax believed it would be unethical to stand idly by as the magnificent variety of the world s cultures and languages was grayed out by centralized commercial entertainment and educational systems although he acknowledged potential problems with intervention he urged that folklorists with their special training actively assist communities in safeguarding and revitalizing their own local traditions similar ideas had been put into practice by benjamin botkin harold w thompson and louis c jones who believed that folklore studied by folklorists should be returned to its home communities to enable it to thrive anew they have been realized in the annual smithsonian folk festival on the mall in washington d c in national and regional initiatives by public folklorists and local activists in helping communities gain recognition for their oral traditions and lifeways both in their home communities and in the world at large and in the national heritage awards concerts and fellowships given by the nea and various state governments to master folk and traditional artists in 2001 in the wake of the attacks in new york and washington of sept 11 unesco s universal declaration of cultural diversity declared the safeguarding of languages and intangible culture on a par with protection of individual human rights and as essential for human survival as biodiversity is for nature ideas first articulated by alan lomax from 1942 to 1979 lomax was investigated and repeatedly interviewed by the fbi although nothing incriminating was ever found and the investigation was eventually abandoned scholar and jazz pianist ted gioia uncovered and published extracts from alan lomax s 800 page fbi files the investigation appears to have started when an anonymous informant reported overhearing lomax s father telling guests in 1941 about his son s communist sympathies looking for leads the fbi seized on the fact that as a teenager lomax had transferred from harvard to the university of texas after being arrested in boston in connection with a political demonstration in 1942 the fbi bizarrely sent agents to interview students at harvard s freshman dorm about lomax s participation in a demonstration that had occurred there ten years earlier in support of one edith berkman viewed by the fbi as a communist agitator and threatened with deportation lomax had been charged with disturbing the peace and fined 25 00 miss berkman however had been cleared of accusations against her and was not deported nor had lomax s academic record been affected in any way nevertheless the bureau continued to try to show that in 1932 lomax had either distributed communist literature or made public speeches in support of the communist party according to ted gioia lomax must have felt it necessary to address the suspicions he gave a sworn statement to an fbi agent on april 3 1942 denying both of these charges he also explained his arrest while at harvard as the result of police overreaction he was he claimed 15 at the time he was actually 17 and a college student and he said he had intended to participate in a peaceful demonstration lomax said he and his colleagues agreed to stop their protest when police asked them to but that he was grabbed by a couple of policemen as he was walking away that is pretty much the story there except that it distressed my father very very much lomax told the fbi i had to defend my righteous position and he couldn t understand me and i couldn t understand him it has made a lot of unhappiness for the two of us because he loved harvard and wanted me to be a great success there lomax transferred to the university of texas the following year lomax left harvard after a year because his father lost his job and all his money during the depression and could no longer afford to send him there and not for any political or academic reasons he probably also had wanted to be close to his newly bereaved father now a widower in june 1942 the fbi approached the librarian of congress archibald mcleish attempting to have lomax fired as assistant in charge of the library s archive of american folk song at the time lomax was preparing for a field trip to the mississippi delta on behalf of the library where he would make landmark recordings of muddy waters son house and david honeyboy edwards among others mcleish wrote to hoover defending lomax i have studied the findings of these reports very carefully i do not find positive evidence that mr lomax has been engaged in subversive activities and i am therefore taking no disciplinary action toward him nevertheless according to gioia yet what the probe failed to find in terms of prosecutable evidence it made up for in speculation about his character an fbi report dated july 23 1943 describes lomax as possessing an erratic artistic temperament and a bohemian attitude it says he has a tendency to neglect his work over a period of time and then just before a deadline he produces excellent results the file quotes one informant who said that lomax was a very peculiar individual that he seemed to be very absent minded and that he paid practically no attention to his personal appearance this same source adds that he suspected lomax s peculiarity and poor grooming habits came from associating with the hillbillies who provided him with folk tunes lomax who was a founding member of people s songs was in charge of campaign music for henry a wallace s 1948 presidential run on the progressive party ticket on a platform opposing the arms race and supporting civil rights for jews and african americans subsequently lomax was one of the performers listed in red channels as a possible communist sympathizer and was consequently blacklisted from working in us entertainment industries a 2007 bbc news article revealed that in the early 50s the british mi5 placed alan lomax under surveillance as a suspected communist its report concluded that although lomax undoubtedly held left wing views there was no evidence he was a communist released sept 4 2007 a summary of his mi5 file reads as follows noted american folk music archivist and collector alan lomax first attracted the attention of the security service when it was noted that he had made contact with the romanian press attaché in london while he was working on a series of folk music broadcasts for the bbc in 1952 correspondence ensued with the american authorities as to lomax suspected membership of the communist party though no positive proof is found on this file the service took the view that lomax work compiling his collections of world folk music gave him a legitimate reason to contact the attaché and that while his views were undoubtedly left wing there was no need for any specific action against him the file contains a partial record of lomax movements contacts and activities while in britain and includes for example a police report of the songs of the iron road concert at st pancras in december 1953 his association with film director joseph losey is also mentioned the fbi again investigated lomax in 1956 and sent a 68 page report to the cia and the attorney general s office however william tompkins assistant attorney general wrote to hoover that the investigation had failed to disclose sufficient evidence to warrant prosecution or the suspension of lomax s passport then as late as 1979 an fbi report suggested that lomax had recently impersonated an fbi agent the report appears to have been based on mistaken identity the person who reported the incident to the fbi said that the man in question was around 43 about 5 feet 9 inches and 190 pounds the fbi file notes that lomax stood 6 feet tall weighed 240 pounds and was 64 at the time lomax resisted the fbi s attempts to interview him about the impersonation charges but he finally met with agents at his home in november 1979 he denied that he d been involved in the matter but did note that he d been in new hampshire in july 1979 visiting a film editor about a documentary the fbi s report concluded that lomax made no secret of the fact that he disliked the fbi and disliked being interviewed by the fbi lomax was extremely nervous throughout the interview the fbi investigation was concluded the following year shortly after lomax s 65th birthday alan lomax received the national medal of arts from president reagan in 1986 a

albert schweitzer was a german french theologian musician philosopher and physician he was born in kaysersberg in the province of elsass lothringen at the time in the german empire schweitzer challenged both the secular view of jesus as depicted by historical critical methodology current at his time in certain academic circles as well the traditional christian view depicting a jesus christ who expected and predicted the imminent end of the world he received the 1952 nobel peace prize in 1953 for his philosophy of reverence for life expressed in many ways but most famously in founding and sustaining the albert schweitzer hospital in lambaréné now in gabon west central africa as a music scholar and organist he studied the music of german composer johann sebastian bach and influenced the organ reform movement schweitzer s passionate quest was to discover a universal ethical philosophy anchored in a universal reality and make it directly available to all of humanity this is reflected in some of his sayings such as until he extends his circle of compassion to include all living things man will not himself find peace i don t know what your destiny will be but one thing i do know the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve albert schweitzer was born on 14 january 1875 in kaysersberg alsace the son of a lutheran pastor he attended high school in mulhausen alsace from 1893 to 1899 he studied philosophy and protestant theology first at the university of strassburg then at the universities of berlin paris and university of tübingen where he completed his doctoral degree and published his ph d in 1899 in 1900 he became pastor of the church of st nicolas in strassburg then in 1901 principal of the theological seminary in strassburg in 1905 he completed the quest of the historical jesus a classic work of biblical historical criticism he then began to study for a medical degree in 1911 he completed his medical degree and published his medical dissertation in 1912 he married helene bresslau daughter of the jewish pan germanist historian harry bresslau the two left for africa later that year to establish a missionary hospital in lambaréné in 1917 they came back to europe for medical treatment in 1919 their daughter rhena was born during world war i the french made schweitzer and his wife both germans leave africa in 1924 schweitzer returned a second time to lambaréné this time without his wife he would remain there off and on for the rest of his life returning frequently to europe for speaking engagements in 1931 he published his autobiography aus meinem leben und denken in 1953 he was awarded the nobel peace prize for the year 1952 on november 5 1961 at the age of 86 schweitzer became an unitarian universalist and adhered to the church of the larger fellowship schweitzer died on september 4 1965 aged 90 in his own hospital in lambaréné his death was attributed to circulatory trouble brought on by his advanced age born in kaysersberg schweitzer spent his childhood in the village of gunsbach alsace where his father the local lutheran evangelical pastor taught him how to play music during schweitzer s youth the region was a traditional part of germany but following the treaties of world war i it was assumed by france the tiny village is home to the association internationale albert schweitzer the günsbach medieval era parish church was of a special protestant catholic kind found in various places in germany even today it was shared by the two congregations which held their prayers in different areas of the same church at different times on sundays a compromise made after the protestant reformation and the thirty years war schweitzer the pastor s son grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance and developed the belief that true christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purpose schweitzer s home language was an alsatian dialect of german at mülhausen high school he got his abitur in 1893 he studied organ there from 1885 1893 with eugène munch organist of the protestant temple who inspired schweitzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of german composer richard wagner in 1893 he played for the french organist charles marie widor for whom johann sebastian bach s organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal widor deeply impressed agreed to teach schweitzer without fee and a great and influential friendship was begun from 1893 he studied protestant theology at the kaiser wilhelm universität of straßburg there he also received instruction in piano and counterpoint from professor gustav jacobsthal and associated closely with ernest munch organist of st william church who was also a passionate admirer of j s bach s music schweitzer did his one year s obligitory military service in 1894 schweitzer saw many operas of richard wagner at straßburg and in 1896 he pulled together the funds to visit bayreuth to see wagner s der ring des nibelungen and parsifal and was deeply affected soon afterwards he visited the new organ in the liederhalle at stuttgart and appalled by its lack of clarity experienced another great realization in 1898 he went back to paris to write a ph d dissertation on the religious philosophy of kant at the sorbonne and to study in earnest with widor here he often met with the elderly aristide cavaillé coll he also studied piano at that time with marie jaëll he completed his theology degree in 1899 and published his ph d at the university of tübingen in 1899 schweitzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organist dedicated also to the rescue restoration and study of historic pipe organs with theological insight he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbolical representation in j s bach s religious music in 1899 he astonished widor by explaining figures and motifs in bach s chorale preludes as painter like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hymns on which they were based they were works of devotional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas conceived visually the exposition of these ideas encouraged by widor and munch became schweitzer s next task and appeared in the masterly study j s bach le musicien poète written in french and published in 1905 during its preparation he became a friend of cosima wagner with whom he had many theological and musical conversations exploring his view of bach s descriptive music and playing the major chorale preludes for her at the temple neuf there was a great demand for a german edition but instead he rewrote it in two volumes in german which were published in 1908 and in an english translation by ernest newman in 1911 schweitzer s interpretative approach greatly influenced the modern understanding of bach s music he became a welcome guest at the wagner s home wahnfried his pamphlet the art of organ building and organ playing in germany and france republished with an appendix on the state of the organ building industry in 1927 effectively launched the twentieth century orgelbewegung which turned away from romantic extremes and rediscovered baroque principles although this sweeping reform movement in organ building eventually went further than schweitzer himself had intended in 1909 he addressed the third congress of the international society of music at vienna on the subject having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ builders in several european countries he produced a very considered report this provided the basis for the international regulations for organ building he envisaged instruments in which the french late romantic full organ sound should work integrally with the english and german romantic reed pipes and with the classical alsace silbermann organ resources and baroque flue pipes all in registers regulated to access distinct voices in fugue or counterpoint capable of combination without loss of distinctness different voices singing together in the same music in 1905 widor and schweitzer were among the six musicians who founded the paris bach society a choir dedicated to performing j s bach s music for whose concerts schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913 he was also appointed organist for the bach concerts of the orféo català at barcelona and often travelled there for the purpose he and widor collaborated on a new edition of bach s organ works with detailed analysis of each work in three languages schweitzer who insisted that the score should show bach s notation with no additional markings wrote the commentaries for the preludes and fugues and widor those for the sonatas and concertos six volumes were published in 1912 14 three more to contain the chorale preludes with schweitzer s analyses were to be worked on in africa but these were never completed perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought on departure for lambaréné in 1913 he was presented with a piano with pedal attachments built especially for the tropics it was delivered by river in a huge dug out canoe to lambaréné packed in a zinc lined case at first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art and fell out of practise but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of bach mendelssohn widor césar franck and max reger systematically it became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on sunday afternoons schweitzer s piano organ was still in use at lambaréné in 1946 sir donald tovey dedicated his conjectural completion of bach s die kunst der fuge to schweitzer in 1899 schweitzer became a deacon at the church saint nicolas of strasbourg in 1900 with the completion of his licentiate in theology he was ordained as curate and that year he witnessed the oberammergau passion play in the following year he became provisional principal of the theological college of saint thomas and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent since the mid 1890s schweitzer had formed the inner resolve that it was needful for him as a christian to repay to the world something for the happiness which it had given to him and he determined that he would pursue his younger interests until the age of thirty and then give himself to serving humanity with jesus serving as his example in 1906 he published geschichte der leben jesu forschung this book established his reputation and it is worth reviewing its publication history the original edition was translated into english by william montgomery and published in 1910 under the somewhat aberrant title the quest of the historical jesus this title stuck however and the book became famous under that name in the english speaking world a second german edition was published in 1913 containing theologically significant revisions and expansions this revised edition did not appear in english until 2001 in the quest schweitzer reviewed all prior work on the question of the historical jesus starting in the late 18th century he pointed out how jesus image had changed with the times and with the personal proclivities of the various authors he concluded with his own synopsis and interpretation of what had been learned over the course of the previous century he took the position that the life of jesus must be interpreted in the light of jesus own convictions which he characterized as those of late jewish eschatology schweitzer wrote that jesus and his followers expected the imminent end of the world he became very focused on the study and cross referencing of the many biblical verses promising the return of the son of man and the exact details of this urgent event as it was originally believed that it would unfold he noted that in the gospel of mark jesus speaks of a tribulation with nation rising against nation false prophets earthquakes stars falling from the sky and the coming of the son of man in the clouds with great power and glory jesus even tells his disciples exactly when all this will happen verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done the same story is told in the gospel of matthew with jesus promising his rapid return as the son of man and again saying verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled even st paul believed these things schweitzer observes and schweitzer concludes that christians of the first century theology literally believed in the imminent fulfillment of jesus promise schweitzer realizes that critical first century theology has been ignored by the faithful almost all early followers are known to have been illiterate only those few literate leaders then in power could be aware of the critical unfulfilled first century promise indivisible from the original theology of jesus schweitzer observes that the early church leaders introduced a modified theology once the prompt return of jesus failed to occur obviously the early leaders would surely lose power and their employment if they failed to modify the original theology the publication of the quest for the historical jesus effectively put a stop for decades to work on the historical jesus as a sub discipline of new testament studies this work resumed however with the development of the so called second quest among whose notable exponents was rudolf bultmann s student ernst käsemann schweitzer writes that the many modern versions of christianity deliberately ignore the urgency of the message that jesus originally promised for an immediate world end that was so powerfully proclaimed in his first century theology each new generation hopes to be the one to see the world destroyed another world coming and the saints governing a new earth schweitzer brilliantly concludes that the first century theology originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed jesus is both incompatible and far removed from those beliefs later made official by the roman emperor constantine in 325 ce schweitzer established his reputation further as a new testament scholar with other theological studies including the psychiatric study of jesus and his two studies of the apostle paul paul and his interpreters and the more complete the mysticism of paul the apostle this examined the eschatological beliefs of paul and the message of the new testament at the age of 30 in 1905 he answered the call of the society of the evangelist missions of paris who were looking for a medical doctor however the committee of this french missionary society was not ready to accept his offer considering that his lutheran theology was incorrect he could easily have obtained a place in a german evangelical mission but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties amid a hail of protests from his friends family and colleagues he resigned his post and re entered the university as a student in a punishing seven year course towards the degree of a doctorate in medicine a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude he planned to spread the gospel by the example of his christian labor of healing rather than through the verbal process of preaching and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of christian teaching even in his study of medicine and through his clinical course schweitzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher scientist by extreme application and hard work he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911 his medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical jesus the psychiatric study of jesus in june 1912 he married helene bresslau daughter of the jewish pan germanist historian harry bresslau in 1912 now armed with a medical degree schweitzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the paris missionary society s mission at lambaréné on the ogooué river in what is now the gabon in africa he refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted by concerts and other fund raising he was ready to equip a small hospital taking satisfaction that bach himself had assisted in the enterprise in spring 1913 he and his wife set off to establish a hospital near an already existing mission post the site was nearly 200 miles upstream from the mouth of the ogooé at port gentil but downstream of most tributaries so that internal communications within gabon converged towards lambaréné in the first nine months he and his wife had about 2 000 patients to examine some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him in addition to injuries he was often treating severe sandflea and crawcraw sores framboesia tropical eating sores heart disease tropical dysentery and arseno benzol tropical malaria sleeping sickness treated at that time with atoxyl leprosy fevers strangulated hernias necrosis abdominal tumours and chronic constipation and nicotine poisoning while also attempting to deal with deliberate poisonings fetishism and fear of cannibalism among the mbahouin frau schweitzer was anaesthetist for surgical operations using chloroform and omnipon a synthesized morphine derivative after briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut in autumn 1913 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron with two 13 foot rooms and with a dispensary and sterilising room in spaces below the broad eaves the waiting room and dormitory were built like native huts of unhewn logs along a 30 yard path leading from the hospital to the landing place the schweitzers had their own bungalow and employed as their assistant joseph a french speaking galoa who first came as a patient when world war i broke out in summer of 1914 schweitzer and his wife germans in a french colony were put under supervision at lambaréné by the french military in 1917 exhausted by over four years work and by tropical anaemia they were taken to bordeaux and interned first in garaison and then from march 1918 in saint rémy de provence in july 1918 after having been transferred via switzerland to his home in the alsace he was a free man again at this time schweitzer born a german citizen obtained french nationality then working as medical assistant and assistant pastor in strasbourg he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization which had occupied his mind since 1900 by 1920 his health recovering he was giving organ recitals and doing other fund raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to gabon in 1922 he delivered the dale memorial lectures in oxford university and from these in the following year appeared volumes i and ii of his great work the decay and restoration of civilization and civilization and ethics the two remaining volumes on the world view of reverence for life and a fourth on the civilized state were never completed in 1924 he returned without his wife but with an oxford undergraduate noel gillespie as assistant everything was heavily decayed and building and doctoring progressed together for months he now had salvarsan for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia additional medical staff nurse kottmann and dr victor nessmann joined him in 1924 and dr mark lauterberg in 1925 the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies later dr trensz replaced nessmann and martha lauterberg and hans muggenstorm joined them joseph also returned in 1925 6 new hospital buildings were constructed and also a ward for white patients so that the site became like a village the onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients drug advances for sleeping sickness included germanin and tryparsamide dr trensz conducted experiments showing that the non amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera vibrion with the new hospital built and the medical team established schweitzer returned to europe in 1927 this time leaving a functioning hospital at work he was there again from 1929 1932 gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged not only in europe but worldwide there was a further period of work in 1935 in january 1937 he returned again to lambaréné and continued working there throughout the second war schweitzer considered his work as a medical missionary in africa to be his response to jesus call to become fishers of men but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of european colonizers who can describe the injustice and cruelties that in the course of centuries they have suffered at the hands of europeans if a record could be compiled of all that has happened between the white and the coloured races it would make a book containing numbers of pages which the reader would have to turn over unread because their contents would be too horrible rather than being a supporter of colonialism schweitzer was one of its harshest critics in a sermon that he preached on 6 january 1905 before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a doctor in africa he said our culture divides people into two classes civilized men a title bestowed on the persons who do the classifying and others who have only the human form who may perish or go to the dogs for all the civilized men care oh this noble culture of ours it speaks so piously of human dignity and human rights and then disregards this dignity and these rights of countless millions and treads them underfoot only because they live overseas or because their skins are of different color or because they cannot help themselves this culture does not know how hollow and miserable and full of glib talk it is how common it looks to those who follow it across the seas and see what it has done there and this culture has no right to speak of personal dignity and human rights i will not enumerate all the crimes that have been committed under the pretext of justice people robbed native inhabitants of their land made slaves of them let loose the scum of mankind upon them think of the atrocities that were perpetrated upon people made subservient to us how systematically we have ruined them with our alcoholic gifts and everything else we have done we decimate them and then by the stroke of a pen we take their land so they have nothing left at all if all this oppression and all this sin and shame are perpetrated under the eye of the german god or the american god or the british god and if our states do not feel obliged first to lay aside their claim to be christian then the name of jesus is blasphemed and made a mockery and the christianity of our states is blasphemed and made a mockery before those poor people the name of jesus has become a curse and our christianity yours and mine has become a falsehood and a disgrace if the crimes are not atoned for in the very place where they were instigated for every person who committed an atrocity in jesus name someone must step in to help in jesus name for every person who robbed someone must bring a replacement for everyone who cursed someone must bless and now when you speak about missions let this be your message we must make atonement for all the ter rible crimes we read of in the newspapers we must make atonement for the still worse ones which we do not read about in the papers crimes that are shrouded in the silence of the jungle night schweitzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being paternalistic or colonialist in his attitude towards africans and in some ways his views did differ from many liberals of the 1960s for instance he thought gabonese independence came too early without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances edgar berman quotes schweitzer speaking these lines in 1960 no society can go from the primeval directly to an industrial state without losing the leavening that time and an agricultural period allow chinua achebe has quoted schweitzer as saying the african is indeed my brother but my junior brother which achebe criticized him for though achebe seems to acknowledge that schweitzer s use of the word brother at all was for a european of the early 20th century an unusual expression of human solidarity between whites and blacks later in his life schweitzer was quoted as saying the time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed the journalist james cameron visited lambaréné in 1953 and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of schweitzer and his staff the hospital suffered from squalor was without modern amenities and schweitzer had little contact with the local people cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time according to a recent bbc dramatisation he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an exposé aimed at debunking schweitzer american journalist john gunther also visited lambaréné in the 1950s and reported schweitzer s patronizing attitude towards africans he also noted the lack of africans trained to be skilled workers after three decades in africa schweitzer still depended on europe for nurses by comparison his contemporary sir albert cook in uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 1910s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of luganda the keynote of schweitzer s personal philosophy was the idea of reverence for life he thought that western civilization was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its ethical foundation in the preface to civilization and ethics he presents the view that western philosophy from descartes to kant had set out to define the objective material world in the expectation that humanity would be found to have a special significance and value within it but no proof of this was found and as a result the rationalist life affirmation of the age of enlightenment began to evaporate so a split occurred between this materialist world view as knowledge and the life view understood as will or volition and expressed in the pessimist philosophies from schopenhauer onward scientific materialism revealed an objective world process which was devoid of ethics entirely an expression of the will to live schweitzer stated that mankind must accept this reality that the objective material world is ethically neutral therefore it was necessary for mankind to affirm a new enlightenment by the rebirth of spiritual rationalism by giving priority to volition to ethical will as life view in order to define and build the structures of civilization mankind must choose to create the moral structures of civilization the world view must derive from the life view not vice versa because the world is an expression of will to life respect for life has to become the highest principle in a similar exaltation of life to that of friedrich nietzsche schweitzer followed the same line as that of leo tolstoy he wrote true philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness and this may be formulated as follows i am life which wills to live and i exist in the midst of life which wills to live life and love in his view are based on and follow out of the same principle respect for every manifestation of life and a personal spiritual relationship towards the universe ethics according to schweitzer consists in the compulsion to show toward the will to live of each and every being the same reverence as one does to one s own circumstances where we apparently fail to satisfy this compulsion should not lead us to defeatism since the will to live renews itself again and again as an outcome of an evolutionary necessity and a phenomenon with a spiritual dimension however as schweitzer himself pointed out it is neither impossible nor difficult to spend one s life and not follow it the history of world philosophies and religions shows many instances of denial of the principle of reverence for life he points to the prevailing philosophy in the european middle ages and the indian brahminic philosophy as examples nevertheless he contends that this kind of attitude lacks genuineness the will to live is naturally both parasitic and antagonistic towards other forms of life only in the thinking being has the will to live become conscious of other wills to live and desirous of solidarity with it this solidarity however cannot be brought about because human life does not escape the puzzling and horrible circumstance that it must live at the cost of other life but as an ethical being one strives to escape whenever possible from this necessity and to put a stop to this disunion of the will to live so far as it is within one s power schweitzer advocated the concept of reverence for life widely throughout his entire life the historical enlightenment waned and corrupted itself schweitzer held because it has not been well enough grounded in thought but compulsively followed the ethical will to live hence he looked forward to a renewed and more profound renaissance and enlightenment in the course of which humanity will discover that the ethical impulse is the highest truth and the highest purposiveness  albert schweitzer nourished hope in a humankind that is more profoundly aware of its position in the universe his optimism was based in belief in truth he persistently emphasized the necessity to think rather than merely acting on basis of passing impulses or by following the most widespread opinions common among those found ignoring the conflationary elements so apparent in religious identity respect for life resulting from contemplation on one s own conscious will to live leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature schweitzer was much respected for putting his theory into practice in his own life after the birth of their daughter mme helene schweitzer was no longer able to live in lambaréné owing to her health a house was maintained at königsfeld im schwarzwald baden württemberg and this house is now maintained as a schweitzer museum from 1939 48 he stayed in lambaréné unable to go back to europe because of the war three years after the end of world war ii in 1948 he returned for the first time to europe and kept traveling back and forth as long as he was able during his return visits to his home village of gunsbach schweitzer continued to make use of the family house which after his death became an archive and museum to his life and work his life was portrayed in the 1952 movie il est minuit docteur schweitzer starring pierre fresnay as albert schweitzer and jeanne moreau as his nurse marie schweitzer inspired actor hugh o brian when o brian visited in africa o brian returned to the united states and founded the hugh o brian youth leadership foundation the nobel peace prize of 1952 was awarded to dr albert schweitzer his the problem of peace lecture is considered one of the best speeches ever given from 1952 until his death he worked against nuclear tests and nuclear weapons with albert einstein and bertrand russell in 1957 and 1958 he broadcast four speeches over radio oslo which were published in peace or atomic war in 1957 schweitzer was one of the founders of the committee for a sane nuclear policy on 23 april 1957 dr schweitzer made his declaration of conscience speech it was broadcast to the world over radio oslo pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons he ended his speech saying the end of further experiments with atom bombs would be like the early sunrays of hope which suffering humanity is longing for in 1955 he was made an honorary member of the order of merit by elizabeth ii of the united kingdom he was also a chevalier of the military and hospitaller order of saint lazarus of jerusalem schweitzer died on 4 september 1965 at his beloved hospital in lambaréné gabon his grave on the banks of the ogowe river is marked by a cross he made himself his cousin anne marie schweitzer sartre was the mother of jean paul sartre the albert schweitzer fellowship sends third year medical students to spend three months working as fellows at the albert schweitzer hospital in lambaréné gabon on clinical rotations recordings of schweitzer playing the music of bach are available on cd during 1934 and 1935 he was for some time in britain delivering the gifford lectures at edinburgh and those on religion in modern civilization at oxford and london he had originally conducted trials for recordings for hmv on the organ of the old queen s hall in london these records did not satisfy him the instrument being too harsh in mid december 1935 he began to record for columbia records on the organ of all hallows barking by the tower then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the church of ste aurélie in strasbourg on a mid 18th century organ by johann andreas silbermann an organ builder greatly revered by bach which had been restored by the lorraine organ builder frédéric härpfer shortly before the first world war these recordings were made in the course of a fortnight in october 1936 altogether his early columbia discs included 25 records of bach and eight of césar franck the bach titles were mainly distributed as follows later recordings were made

bassist michael flea balzary and drummer chad smith the band s varied musical style has fused traditional rock and funk with various elements of punk rock and psychedelic rock in addition to kiedis and flea the group originally featured guitarist hillel slovak and drummer jack irons slovak however died of a heroin overdose in 1988 resulting in irons departure irons was replaced briefly by former dead kennedys drummer d h peligro before the band found a permanent replacement in smith while slovak was replaced by up and coming guitarist frusciante this lineup recorded the band s fourth and fifth albums mother s milk and blood sugar sex magik blood sugar sex magik became an extremely significant record for the band it thrust them into mainstream success with over thirteen million copies sold frusciante grew uncomfortable with this new found success and left abruptly in the middle of the tour for the album in 1992 descending into heroin addiction kiedis flea and smith employed dave navarro of jane s addiction for their subsequent album one hot minute although fairly successful it did not match the critical acclaim of blood sugar sex magik and sold less than half the copies of its predecessor shortly afterwards navarro departed the band due to creative differences frusciante fresh out of drug rehabilitation rejoined the band in 1998 at flea s request the reunited quartet returned to the studio to record californication which went on to sell fifteen million units worldwide becoming their most successful album to date it was followed three years later with by the way which continued their success in 2006 the group released the double album stadium arcadium giving them their first american number 1 album the band has won seven grammy awards they ve sold over fifty million albums worldwide have eight singles in the top 40 of the billboard hot 100 have five 1 singles on the mainstream rock charts and hold a record of eleven 1 singles on the modern rock charts in 2009 the band will become eligible for induction into the rock and roll hall of fame they are currently on hiatus red hot chili peppers were formed by fairfax high school alumni anthony kiedis hillel slovak jack irons and michael flea balzary in 1983 rhcp s first performance was at the rhythm lounge to a crowd of roughly thirty people opening for tim allen one song had been created for the occasion which involved the band then known as tony flow and the mystical masters of mayhem improvising music while kiedis rapped a poem he had written called out in l a as slovak and irons were already committed to another group what is this it was intended to be a one time performance however the performance was so lively that the band was asked to return the following week due to this unexpected success the band changed its name to the red hot chili peppers playing several more shows at various la clubs and musical venues six songs from these initial shows were recorded onto the band s first demo tape several months after their first performance the band was signed to the record label emi two weeks earlier what is this had obtained a record deal with mca and as slovak and irons considered the red hot chili peppers a side project they quit to focus on what is this instead of dissolving the band kiedis and flea decided to recruit new members cliff martinez a friend of flea s was asked to join the chili peppers shortly thereafter auditions for a new guitarist produced jack sherman gang of four guitarist andy gill was hired to produce their first album despite kiedis and flea s misgivings he pushed the band to play with a cleaner crisper and more radio friendly sound the red hot chili peppers was released on august 10 1984 and was a commercial flop it initially sold approximately 25 000 units and garnered little marketable recognition the ensuing tour fared little better as continuing musical and lifestyle tension between kiedis and sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life sherman was fired soon after with slovak returning to the chili peppers after growing tired of what is this george clinton was selected to produce the next red hot chili peppers album freaky styley the album was recorded in detroit s famed r b and funky united sound systems studios on the edge of wayne state university s campus clinton combined various elements of punk and funk into the band s repertoire allowing their music to incorporate a variety of distinct styles however though the band had a much better relationship with clinton than with gill freaky styley released on august 16 1985 also achieved little success failing to make an impression on any chart the subsequent tour was also considered unproductive by the band cliff martinez was dismissed from the group in the summer of 1986 with kiedis saying that he sensed that martinez wished to leave jack irons out of work and finally separated from other commitments rejoined the group to kiedis flea and slovak s great surprise the chili peppers attempted to hire rick rubin to produce their third album but he turned the offer down the band eventually hired michael beinhorn who was the band s last choice songs began to form quickly and the album s shape came into view blending the same funk feel and rhythms as freaky styley but also taking a harder more immediate approach to punk rock and funk metal reuniting all four original members renewed their creativity enlivening the recording process on september 29 1987 the uplift mofo party plan was released becoming the first red hot chili peppers album to appear on any chart although it peaked at only 148 on the billboard hot 200 this was a significant success compared to the chili peppers first two albums during this period however kiedis and slovak had both developed serious drug addictions often abandoning the band each other and their significant others for days on end slovak s addiction led to his death on june 25 1988 not long after the conclusion of the uplift tour kiedis fled the city and did not attend slovak s funeral considering the situation to be surreal and dreamlike jack irons subsequently left the group saying that he did not want to be part of a group where his friends were dying in an attempt to cope with the death of slovak and the departure of irons kiedis and flea temporarily employed dead kennedys drummer d h peligro and former p funk guitarist dewayne blackbyrd mcknight neither sparked any notable chemistry and they were each replaced rapidly however peligro s brief tenure did have one vital long term consequence for the red hot chili peppers his association with the band led to john frusciante an acquaintance of peligro to audition for the band s empty guitarist role frusciante was fascinated with the red hot chili peppers and as a result was particularly interested in auditioning following a constructive jam there was a unanimous decision to accept frusciante into the band three weeks prior to the beginning of recording the band was still without a drummer despite several auditions eventually a friend of the band told them about a drummer she knew chad smith who was so proficient on the drums he ate for breakfast kiedis had qualms about allowing smith to try out however he agreed to give him a chance at his audition smith overwhelmed the band by not only matching flea s intricate and complex rhythm but even beginning to lead him after this successful jam session kiedis frusciante and flea admitted smith into the band the recording of the band s fourth album was hindered by conflict with producer michael beinhorn whose primary agenda was to give frusciante s guitar playing a loud overpowering sound similar to the abrasive tones utilized in heavy metal this modification caused frusciante great discomfort as it did not fit with his preferred style of playing an example of this can be heard on the song stone cold bush the chili peppers fourth album mother s milk was released in august 1989 and gave them their first top modern rock hits a tribute ballad to slovak knock me down and their cover of stevie wonder s higher ground the album reached 52 on the american album charts and became the band s first gold record in 1990 the group switched labels to warner bros records with rick rubin hired to produce their then untitled fifth album rubin has produced all of the band s subsequent studio albums the writing process for this album was far more productive than it had been during the creation of mother s milk with kiedis saying that now there was new music for me to lyricize the band embarked on the grueling six month process of recording a new album the long periods of rehearsal songwriting and the incubating of ideas but rubin was dissatisfied with a regular recording studio thinking the band would work better in a less orthodox setting he came across an amazing huge empty historically landmarked mediterranean haunted mansion a stone s throw from where we all lived for the next month or so frusciante kiedis and flea remained in seclusion never once leaving the house during the entire recording process smith however decided not to live in the house believing it to be haunted the band was unable to decide on the title of the album but to rubin one particular song title stuck out blood sugar sex magik although it was not a featured song rick believed it to be clearly the best title they had at the time on september 24 1991 blood sugar sex magik was released give it away was released as the first single it won a grammy award in 1992 for best hard rock performance with vocal and became the band s first number one single on the modern rock chart the ballad under the bridge was released as the follow up single and went on to reach 2 on the billboard hot 100 chart the highest the band has reached on that chart and became one of the band s most recognizable songs other singles such as breaking the girl and suck my kiss also fared well on the charts the album itself was an international sensation selling over 12 million copies and greatly broadening the chili peppers audience blood sugar sex magik was listed at number 310 on the rolling stone magazine list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and in 1992 it rose to 3 on the u s album charts almost a year after its release the band s success and drug addiction were taking their toll on frusciante who abruptly quit the band during the blood sugar japanese tour in may 1992 the band headlined the lollapalooza festival in 1992 with replacement guitarist arik marshall and briefly with jesse tobias of the los angeles based band mother tongue neither lasted very long with the rest of the band stating that the chemistry wasn t right they eventually settled on former jane s addiction guitarist dave navarro dave navarro first appeared with the band at woodstock 94 where they wore enormous light bulb costumes attached precariously to chrome metallic suits making it near impossible for them to play their instruments while externally the band appeared to be settled the relationship between the three established members and navarro had begun to deteriorate his differing musical background made performing difficult as they began playing together and continued to be an issue over the next year as his first and only album with the red hot chili peppers one hot minute was recorded and released on september 12 1995 the band described the album as a darker sadder record compared to their previous material despite mixed reviews the album was a commercial success selling five million copies worldwide it spawned the band s third 1 single the ballad my friends and enjoyed chart success with the songs warped and aeroplane this iteration of the band was also featured on several soundtracks i found out a john lennon cover was featured on working class hero a tribute to john lennon the ohio players cover love rollercoaster was featured on the beavis and butthead do america soundtrack and was released as a single by this point kiedis had resumed his heroin dependence in april 1998 it was announced that navarro had left the band due to creative differences kiedis stated that the decision was mutual reports at the time however indicated navarro s departure came after he attended a band practice under the influence of drugs which at one point involved him falling backwards over his own amp kiedis has since said that though the event should have been comical it was instead pitiful and was the impetus for navarro s departure in the years following his departure from the band it became public that john frusciante had developed an addiction to heroin which left him in poverty and near death he was talked into admitting himself to las encinas drug rehabilitation center in january 1998 he concluded the process in february of that year and began renting a small apartment in silver lake he acquired many injuries problems in the years of his addiction some requiring surgery including permanent scarring on his arms a restructured nose and new teeth to prevent fatal infection in april 1998 flea visited his former band mate and openly invited frusciante to re join the band an invitation an emotional frusciante readily accepted within the week and for the first time in six years the reunited foursome gathered to play and jump started the newly reunited red hot chili peppers anthony kiedis said of the situation despite the band s elation by frusciante s return he was both mentally and physically torn frusciante had not played with the band since his departure and having previously lost every guitar he owned in a house fire from which he barely escaped he experienced a difficult time resuming the life he had prior to his drug usage his talent did however resurface and new songs began to roll out on june 8 1999 after over a year of production and meticulous practice californication was released as the band s seventh studio album an almost instant achievement the album ultimately sold over 15 million copies worldwide and became the band s most successful recording to date californication contained fewer rap driven songs than its predecessors instead integrating textured consistent and melodic guitar riffs vocals and bass lines californication peaked at 3 in the us and produced three more number one modern rock hits scar tissue otherside and californication scar tissue won the 2000 grammy award for best rock song it was also performed at the ceremony and included a brief jam with rapper snoop dogg at its culmination other singles included around the world road trippin and parallel universe which broke the top 40 modern rock charts despite not having been commercially released as a single in july 1999 as part of the band s two year long international world tour in support of their new album the red hot chili peppers played at woodstock 1999 some 10 minutes before the show they were asked by jimi hendrix s sister to play a cover of her brother s songs after some hesitation the band decided to play his classic fire which they had covered in mother s milk coincidentally about two thirds of the way into the band s set the closing set of the three day concert a small fire escalated into full fledged vandalism and resulted in the intervention of riot control squads in 2001 the chili peppers released their first concert dvd off the map the dvd was directed by longtime friend dick rude who had also produced the music videos for catholic school girls rule and universally speaking the footage was taken from two different concerts but was amalgamated with transition and indistinguishable song conversions the band began writing their next album in early 2001 and released by the way over a year later on july 9 2002 the album at the time was their most noteworthy chart debut selling over a million copies in first week and emerging at 2 on the billboard 200 it produced five hit singles by the way the zephyr song can t stop dosed and universally speaking and was the most subdued album they had generated to date focusing primarily on melodic ballads as opposed to the chili peppers classic style of rap driven funk frusciante also concentrated on a more layered texture on many of the songs often adding keyboard parts and also writing string arrangements for songs the album was followed by an eighteen month long world tour the chili peppers recorded two new songs fortune faded and save the population for their greatest hits album released in november 2003 peaking at 18 on the billboard 200 however universally speaking and by the way were the only two songs from by the way included in the compilation causing criticism as to why songs such as can t stop and the zephyr song which were extremely successful were not present the european leg of the by the way tour produced the band s second full length concert dvd live at slane castle which was recorded during a show at slane castle in ireland on august 23 2003 the band also went on to release their first full length live album live in

greatest hits sessions in 2006 the band released the grammy award winning stadium arcadium produced by rick rubin although 38 songs were created with the intention of being released as three separate

international world tour in support of stadium arcadium in 2006 beginning with promotional concerts in europe and culminating in a two month long european tour from late may to mid july the group then toured north america from early august to early november returning to europe later in november for a second leg that ran until mid december the chili peppers began the year of 2007 with a second north

interview published may 20 2008 that the red hot chili peppers are disbanded for the moment following the last leg of the tour promoting stadium arcadium the band members have been on a break kiedis attributes this to the band being worn out from their years of nonstop work since californication kiedis explained that he is currently preoccupied with taking care of his new son and possibly creating a short television series called scar tissue which is set to basically be a recap of his book while flea is experimenting with new musical ideas frusciante is continuing his solo career and chad smith is in japan working with a jazz band smith is also currently working with sammy hagar joe satriani and michael anthony in the supergroup chickenfoot the band plans to remain on hiatus for a minimum of one year however kiedis has stated that he is eager to start thinking about new material nevertheless band members appear divided as to what they want for the future of the band according to smith the group was to get together to discuss their next album tentatively in september 2008 smith went on to say that some of our best stuff is yet to come for some reason we have a special thing the four of us we ve changed the chemistry of the band a couple of times when john rejoined for the second time we were like this is a special chemistry we have however flea enrolled at usc fall 2008 and stated that the red hot chili peppers are on a major hiatus the duration of which will be two years according to flea we just needed two years we had our noses to the grindstones so hard for so long we needed to get away from it and get a fresh perspective on things he also stated that they have no tenth album planned yet he has also stated that he is very anxious to release more music in early 2009 frusciante stated that the official news is just that there s no plans to do anything and we re on a hiatus of an indefinite length there s just absolutely no plans to do anything and that s it yeah we worked really hard for ten years and you know there s other things in life the band s newest recording was in 2008 with george clinton on his latest album george clinton and his gangsters of love accompanied by kim manning the band recorded a new version of shirley and lee s classic let the good times roll kiedis provides a range of vocal styles while singing his approach of spoken verse and rapping complemented with more traditional vocals have helped the band maintain a relatively consistent style nevertheless as the group has matured the vocal sequences present in albums starting from californication have drastically reduced the number of rapidly sung verses by the way only contained two songs which remained true to the rap driven verses and subsequent melodic choruses kiedis more recent style has been developed through coaching throughout all nine of red hot chili peppers albums hillel slovak s style was strongly based on blues and funk early replacements including current guitarist john frusciante based their style significantly on slovak s however frusciante has brought a more melodic and textured sound to more recent albums such as by the way californication and stadium arcadium this contrasts with his previous abrasive approach in mother s milk as well as his dry funky and more docile arrangements on blood sugar sex magik dave navarro brought an entirely different sound to the band during his tenure with his style based on heavy metal progressive rock and psychedelia flea s bass style is an amalgamation of funk psychedelic punk and hard rock the groove heavy low tuned melodies played through either normal finger style or aggressive slapping have contributed to the red hot chili peppers signature style while flea s slap bass style was prominent in earlier albums later albums have more melodic bass lines he has also used double stops on don t forget me blood sugar sex magik hump de bump and snow chad smith s in the pocket style of drumming adds space and allows frusciante and flea to add melodies to the beats and grooves more effectively he actively employs rapid successions of the bass drum often following flea s fast bass lines with only one bass drum pedal this is evident in the song the greeting song where in the main riff smith s bass drum mimics flea s bass accents in addition a song like give it away demonstrates his in the pocket drumming that places focuses on the groove over flashiness while kiedis is the lead vocalist for the band frusciante often contributes backing vocals and two part harmonies to various songs he sang lead on the chorus of such blood sugar sex magik songs as the power of equality funky monks breaking the girl and the righteous and the wicked his falsetto is used frequently particularly on by the way and stadium arcadium though it was also used on blood sugar sex magik on the songs if you have to ask and under the bridge frusciante shared lead vocal duties with kiedis on knock me down from mother s milk and has solo spots on songs such as dosed and desecration smile improvisation has always been a major part of the band s signature style with early shows composed almost entirely of improvisations in addition many guitar solos recorded on the current albums and played live by frusciante are improvised as are several of flea s bass solos the band has for most of the last decade opened the show with a short improvisation always in the same key as the initial song sometimes the beginnings middle sections and or endings of the songs are extended by long improvisations such as my lovely man if you have to ask californication parallel universe can t stop throw away your television by the way and dani california the group has always ended the show with a longer improvisation usually stemming from the improvisation to give it away through the years kiedis lyrics have dealt with a variety of topics which have shifted as time has progressed themes within his repertoire include love and friendship teenage angst and good time aggression various sexual topics and the link between sex and music political and social commentary romance loneliness globalization and the cons of fame and hollywood poverty drugs alcohol and dealing with death 
a mashup bootleg or blend is a song or composition created by blending two or more songs usually by overlaying the vocal track of one song seamlessly over the music track of another in full swing at the end of the 20th century mashups have been described positively as ultimate post modern pop song or culture jamming in its purest form they have also been described negatively as the logical extension of the sampling fever of the 80s taken to its dumbest extreme due to the questionable legal status of mash ups and little chance of profits there s a real punk rock attitude attached to the movement cultural critic and legal commentator siva vaidhyanathan has commented that the most interesting and entertaining phenomenon of the mp3 libraries on peer to peer systems is the availability of mashes new compositions created by combining the rhythm tracks of one song and the vocal tracks of another noting that mashups have a rich history he observes that it is merely the latest incarnation of a widely shared deeply embedded cultural habit of cultural recombination across time and space mashups are known by a number of different names in addition more traditional terms such as edits or remixes are favored by many bootleggers though the term bastard pop first became popular in 2001 the practice of assembling new songs from purloined elements of other tracks stretches back to the beginnings of recorded music if one extends the definition beyond the realm of pop precursors can be found in musique concrète as well as the classical practice of arranging traditional folk material and the jazz tradition of reinterpreting standards in addition many elements of bastard pop culture have antecedents in hip hop and the diy ethic of punk the 1999 eminem album the slim shady lp with a cappella vocals from the track my name is combined with the music of many other artists including back in black by ac dc ice ice baby by vanilla ice and this charming man by the smiths served as an early inspiration for the british bastard pop movement in the mid 1990s bastard pop was not yet a distinct genre but formed a significant portion of the output of a few north american experimental artists such as john oswald negativland the evolution control committee and the emergency broadcast network at that time the tracks when they were referred to at all were often just considered remixes though some other terms were used such as tape manipulations cut ups and mashups quodlibet is a classical form of remixing while these examples are not always strictly illegitimate they capture the sense of genre collision characteristic of bastard pop modern classical analogues include various works by pdq bach such as the unbegun symphony which is composed entirely of others works notably a passage blending of tchaichovsky s 1812 overture with the song you are my sunshine john oswald has also composed several concert works he labels as rascali klepitoire which are radical transformations of well known pieces from the classical repertoire as j peter burkholder shows in his book all made of tunes charles ives and the uses of musical borrowing american composer charles ives frequently quoted the works of others throughout his compositions including hymns popular tunes marches and often the music of stephen foster the popular bbc radio 4 panel show i m sorry i haven t a clue features a section known as one song to the tune of another where the panelists have to quite literally sing the words of one song to the tune of another one usually in the form of piano accompaniment some of the humour derives from the incongruity caused by differences between the songs involved they may differ wildly in genre structure tempo and time signature but unlikely combinations have sometimes worked surprisingly well examples include a contribution to the effectiveness of the rendition is made by the pianist colin sell who given the poor vocal skill of the panelists often has a much more difficult task than is usually required in 1956 bill buchanan and dickie goodman caused a musical sensation by releasing the first mainstream bastard pop single the flying saucer the track a reinterpretation of orson welles celebrated war of the worlds mock emergency broadcast interspliced with musical snippets comically dramatizing the portentous patter of the announcer spawned a raft of imitations and quickly became a craze only to pass into oblivion within the space of a year there have been a number of novelty records and one off hits that have included uncleared samples the song your woman by white town features an uncredited sample from a 1932 song my woman by the lew stone band taken from the soundtrack of the dennis potter series pennies from heaven other notable one off bootlegs include dna s dance remix of suzanne vega s tom s diner and you got the love by the source featuring candi staton vega received quite a few unsolicited mixes of her song and eventually issued an entire c d of tom s diner mixes one notable example being jeannie s diner in which a resung verse based on vega s composition describes the premise of the situation comedy i dream of jeannie tom s diner is likely to be the first song that was mash mixed as we now know the process in the 1970s and early 1980s during the disco boom dj pools would sometimes issue medley discs to their members while not technically featuring a sample one such record that achieved moderate chart and club success in the u s was club house s 1983 medley of steely dan s do it again with michael jackson s billie jean this medley hit both the pop and r b charts in august september 1983 one series was john morales deadly medley s in which he mixed up disco hits of the moment to form beat consistent collages in the 1980s dutch producer jaap eggermont produced the stars on 45 series of records these records attempted to cram as many hits as possible into the space of a three and a half minute pop song and are perhaps more accurately described as medleys though these singles have never received critical plaudits the medley idea would later resurface in a more respectable form and moreover the deliberately humorous tone of the stars on 45 singles has not entirely disappeared one must also remember the huge successes of weird al yankovic s lyrical parody of pop hits which earned him a seemingly tenured spot on mtv during the channel s heyday many bastard pop songs have been produced in jest with the emphasis very firmly on satire irresistible puns or simple throwaway fun in the 1970s frank zappa developed a technique he called xenochrony in which a guitar solo was extracted from its original context and placed into a completely different song essentially bastard pop for guitar rather than vocals his recording engineer referred to this as the ampex guitar in his rock opera joe s garage for example zappa s xenochrony can be heard on every track apart from packard goose rubber shirt from the album sheik yerbouti consists of a bass track and a drum track taken from two different live performances melded together in the studio john oswald has been devising illegitimate compositions since the late 1960s his 1975 track power married frenetic led zeppelin guitars to the impassioned exhortations of a southern us evangelist at the same time that hip hop was discovering the potency of the same kinds of ingredients similarly his 1990 track vane which pitted two different versions of the song you re so vain against each other was a blueprint for the contemporary bastard pop subgenre glitch pop oswald coined the term plunderphonics to describe his illegitimate craft in 1993 he released plexure arguably his most ambitious composition to date it attempted to microsample the history of cd music up to that point in a 20 minute collage of bewildering complexity the ambition of this piece would later be recalled by the british bootlegger osymyso whose intro inspection captured the pop junkie feel of plexure osymyso who at the time was unaware of oswald s work used the same structure of an accelerando to link a few bars each of 100 songs creating a simpler sound than the thousands of overlapping and morphing pop electroquotations in plexure though negativland are seldom acknowledged as musical antecedents of bastard pop lacking perhaps the sense of fun many contemporary practitioners seek in their craft their struggle against various forms of censorship and legal coercion has made them poster children for some bastard pop commentators who approach the issue from a more critical perspective and with an eye to the complicated cultural issues raised by both accidental and deliberate plundering within music and culture generally in the wake of these somewhat academic explorations bill drummond and jimmy cauty entered the arena in 1987 with an album of plunderphony which while still serving as a critical reflection on the nature of pop music and the power and potential of the sampler upped the ante by being music one could dance to as well as think about their debut album released under the name the jams 1987 was banned and a number of the songs have the same laptop punk anyone can do it attitude that characterizes bastard pop today the jams morphed into the klf in 1988 and continued to pursue the same art prankster agenda most notably with their number 1 hit doctorin the tardis though the jams grazed the charts and the klf for a while at least practically dominated them illegitimate pop had remained largely an underground affair since the original break in craze swept the us in 1956 working under the name steinski new york copywriter dj and self confessed record junkie steve stein began the next chapter in the evolution of illicit pop by producing a trio of underground 12 singles lesson 2 and lesson 3  which exerted a powerful influence on an entire generation of samplists and continues to be cited to this day as a landmark in the history of sampledelica indeed one can trace a line from double dee and steinski through coldcut s say kids what time is it to dj shadow and the avalanches and to black box whose ride on time spread the gospel of sample wizardry far and wide from the depths of the underground to the top of the charts black box proved to the major labels that a legitimate profitable market was springing up from bedroom turntables after an initial white label period black box sought legal clearance for their usage of dan hartman s song love sensation and samples of the salsoul records recording of such by loleatta holloway in 1995 emergency broadcast network released 3 7 8 the first exclusively video sample based song the three rhode island school of design graduates joshua pearson gardner post and ron o donnell released their self titled video on tvt records it combined video and audio samples of politicians and celebrities in such an artful way that u2 despite their earlier skirmish with negativland invited them to accompany them on their zoo tv tour as video artists in 1994 the experimental band evolution control committee released what are widely credited as being the first modern bastard pop tracks on their hand made cassette album gunderphonic these whipped cream mixes combined a pair of public enemy a cappellas with instrumentals by herb alpert and the tijuana brass first released on home made cassettes in the early 1990s likely in 1991 or 1992 it was later pressed on 7 vinyl and distributed by eerie materials in the mid 1990s the tracks gained some degree of notoriety on college radio stations in the united states on the heels of this release the band gained a larger following with tours in the united states europe and australia and has since released several well known mashups while continuing the pursuit of other experimental styles the name pop will eat itself was unabashedly stolen from an nme feature on the band jamie wednesday written by david quantick which proposed the theory that because popular music simply recycles good ideas continuously the perfect pop song could be written by the best of those ideas into one track hence pop will eat itself the movement gained momentum again in 2001 with the release of two seminal landmarks the 2 many djs album by soulwax s dewaele brothers which combined 45 different tracks in a frenzied vindication of the pop will eat itself prophesy and a remix by freelance hellraiser of christina aguilera s genie in a bottle which coupled the demure pop princess with the raucous guitars of hard to explain by new york s the strokes in an infectious concoction entitled a stroke of genie us this track became one of the most talked about underground hits of 2001 and was featured in many best of lists at the end of the year 2manydjs is the nom de turntable of two belgian brothers david and stephen dewaele who spent two years clearing the samples for their album so their landmark was not entirely illegitimate though they continued to work in the shadowy interzone between legitimacy and copyright felony the freelance hellraiser track in contrast was never officially released and indeed most bastard pop songs are only made available online in a not always successful attempt to avoid cease and desist notices from the copyright holders occasionally however a song gains so much underground momentum that a commercial release becomes inevitable the earliest example of this was richard x whose 2002 track we don t give a damn about our friends grafted an old adina howard a cappella onto the music of tubeway army s are friends electric the song became so popular that it was released with re recorded vocals by sugababes though their version was by design almost indistinguishable from the original the single went straight to number one in the uk charts making it the first bastard pop crossover hit 2001 also saw the release of dj z trip and dj p s mashup project uneasy listening volume 1 an eclectic mix of rock hip hop electro and pop from the 1960s to the 1990s that melded metallica to midnight oil naked eye to public enemy and ac dc to dj red alert dj z trip had made earlier excursions into the genre with live performances such as 1998 s live at the future primitive soundsession vol 2 and future primitive 45 night dj p won the dmc midwest championship and in the 1999 dmc finals in san francisco received the only standing ovation of the event with his innovative style where both of these djs differ from most mashup djs is that they can perform most if not all of their blends live with only their vinyl records and their turntables  a feat that takes much more skill than most other djs of the genre who have gained more notoriety in the same year kylie minogue lent her support to the burgeoning genre by performing soulwax s mashup of new order s blue monday and her own hit can t get you out of my head entitled can t get blue monday out of my head at the brit awards more recently go home productions has released ray of gob which splices together madonna s ray of light and the sex pistols pretty vacant and god save the queen the single which was voted bootleg of the year in 2003 was cleared by the representatives of both parties and the track even earned the approbation of the pistols guitarist steve jones in the wake of these developments hundreds of bedroom djs and songwriters were inspired to make their own bastard pop confections the demise of napster and audiogalaxy while initially making it harder for amateurs to acquire the precious raw materials cheaply quickly led to the birth and meteoric rise of alternative p2p networks such as kazaa limewire emule and more recently bittorrent where once music aficionados could trade only mp3s it now became possible to acquire not only music but the technology to manipulate that music freely and easily the general description of mashups is the result in which a vocal from one song is laid over the music from another however others view mashups as a form of rebellion to the commercialization of pop music with music piracy issues aside one critic believes that a mashup is an expression of consumer dissatisfaction armed with free time and the right software people are rifling through the lesser songs of pop music and in frustration choosing to make some of them as good as the great ones many prominent mashup artists and communities believe that the objective of the consumptive power of the mashup and home remix community is to encourage record labels publishers and artists to consider giving the high quality productions of illegitimate music a legitimate consideration as a promotional avenue for all music as a result of this industry standard tools such as the digital audio workstation cubase and the sound editors wavelab soundforge wavepad and cool edit pro quickly became ubiquitous moreover new tools such as ableton live mixpad and most popular of all sonic foundry s acid pro were tweaked to accommodate the needs of this new scene most notably such features as beat mapping and online previewing made it easy for many people with musical ability but little professional studio experience to knock together new combinations in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional tools such as the magnetic tape john oswald slaved over in their early days mark vidler known as go home productions summarized it by saying the benefits of such technology of acidpro you don t need a distributor because your distribution is the internet you don t need a record label because it s your bedroom and you don t need a recording studio because that s your computer you do it all yourself every new scene must have its water cooler and its journal and in the case of bastard pop circa 2001 2002 get your bootleg on established itself as the former while boomselection took on the role of blog of record not merely reflecting the scene boomselection publicised various challenges which resulted in hundreds if not thousands of new bootlegs being uploaded to sites around the world while the scene began as a primarily british phenomenon the usa france and germany are currently the hotbeds of the modern mashup movement however there are notable bootleggers to be found in practically every corner of the globe wherever an internet connection and a record collection can be found including australia belgium switzerland and sweden the get your bootleg on site is the main launchpad for new bastard pop tunes and is the home of a lively community of bootleggers who offer critiques of new songs tips for newbies pointers on where to find a cappellas legal advice publicity for mashup events and general discussion of issues surrounding the bastard pop phenomenon the name get your bootleg on comes from the missy elliott track get ur freak on which alongside eminem s without me remains perhaps the most bootlegged manipulated remixed and reinterpreted song of the genre other popular frequently bootlegged artists include britney spears christina aguilera madonna and beyoncé in early 2005 boomselection retired itself after a long period of inactivity the year also marked a series of cease and desist orders brought against a number of bootleg sites and in early 2006 gybo received its first such notice to survive the site prohibited the posting of direct links to copyrighted material within the forums but allowed users to post links to their own sites containing such material the defense being that now gybo was no more in violation of copyright law than google for the most part the community has rallied around the site and continues to support it in its new form the void left by boomselection s demise was rapidly replaced by mashuptown which was started in early 2005 is currently the biggest blog source of mashups on the internet the site has recently become the official supplier of mashups to adam curry s daily source code podcast also in 2005 bootie the biggest bootleg mashup party in the world began its monthly bootie top 10 where it posts for free download its ten best mashups as selected by bootie creators and djs a plus d launched in san francisco in 2003 bootie was the first club night in the united states dedicated solely to the burgeoning artform of the bootleg mashup and now hosts monthly parties in several cities around the globe including los angeles paris boston munich and new york city in january 2008 sound unsound was launched as a reaction to gybo s enforced ban on long mixes and podcasts since its inception it has released several mashup albums sound unsound differs from gybo in that there is enhanced interactivity between members through communal compilation albums an integral licensed radio station chat room and arcade in addition the scene has a number of other sites which provide downloads links podcasts previews user vote based rankings such as mashstix com mashup industries mashupciti com and mashup charts also the bastard pop news blogroll is a web mashup of data feeds from over one hundred mashup artists blogs and news sites and combines them into a single feed legal mashups are hard to find but in some relatively small music markets publishers have understood the potential of clearing the rights of major international artist to be combined with local repertoires to create a wider consumption for both artists on a given track in israel for example a group called bonna music remixed the depeche mode song enjoy the silence with balagan s sheket the mashup was approved by martin gore and released officially a month before depeche mode s new album playing the angel in 2005 it was a major hit locally and when depeche mode s first single was released they were more welcome in a market where the local repertoire is dominant putting an a cappella against a completely different backing track in order to make a third song is the original mission of bastard pop and it is no surprise that in the wake of a stroke of genie us the genre has continued to focus on this basic premise another notable versus song is zombi zombie nation which combined zombie nation s kernkraft 400 with goblin s zombi theme and is featured on shaun of the dead s official soundtrack in addition go home productions party ben jstar and dj bc amongst many others have produced a number of critically acclaimed songs in this vein and in some instances have secured record deals on the back of these exercises which arguably serve as demo mp3s of their songwriting and production skills however not all mash ups are as simple as a vs b in some cases djs will mash 3 4 5 and even 6 songs to form one complete track mixing more than two tracks together can be a daunting task and it requires a great deal of skill notably dj earworm has combined the top billboard 25 into a single mashup for 2007 and 2008 mixing two or more versions of a song to create a duet or alternate version of a song is what a version vs version is set to accomplish it can mix 2 different versions of a song such as an ballad and original version or a cover version of the song some of the more popular version to version mixes are language mixes mixing multiple languages into one song version vs version mashups usually have the same original instrumental but sometimes it is changed to benefit the song glitch pop is a subgenre of the bastard pop scene which marries the digital signal processing wizardry associated with kid 606 and tigerbeat6 records to the ostensibly familiar contours of pop sometimes this is done in a spirit of homage sometimes it serves merely as a form of ridicule and even vilification often it is both at the same time an example of the double science at play in glitch pop is skkatter s dirty pop which takes a song that is already an epic of carefully constructed digital micro malfunctions and pushes it even further out to the margins of musical mayhem similarly australian bootlegger and glitch pop co conspirator dsico has reworked a number of r n b tunes by such artists as the neptunes and nsync in a spirit that is at once both satirical and steeped in fanboydom in most cases these remixes render ostensibly mainstream songs avant garde and fresh sometimes by working against the spirit of the original but often by leveraging the sugar rush at the heart of much of the best contemporary pop and adding sonic cgi to its emotional armoury in the uk the most notable exponent of the genre is poj masta a teenage schoolboy whose work has been keenly supported by djs such as eddy temple morris and james hyman of london s xfm radio station their weekly show the remix has played a major role in nurturing new bootleggers and bringing them to the attention of a wide audience technically all bastard pop songs are remixes but while most are made up entirely of plundered material some bootleggers have fused old a cappellas with completely new compositions of their own devising the most popular example of this phenomenon is the björk remix web which contains hundreds of remixes of björk tunes another popular example with fans of japanese pop is evil morning an album which combines vocal tracks from morning musume and their associated artists with new instrumental tracks that rearrange or replay the original music in the style of hard rock or heavy metal dj danger mouse s critically acclaimed remix project the grey album effectively launched a new pop subgenre while the beatles had made appearances on several mash up tracks prior to this album  the grey album distinguished itself by being made up entirely of samples from the beatles white album and vocals from jay z s the black album the project received considerable attention following emi s legal threats towards distributors of the album the dean gray 2005 mashup album american edit is highly regarded as the most influencial mash up album since the grey album american edit was banned by warner music in november 2005 less than two weeks after its release and received massive attention due to an online protest formed by mash up supporters which reportedly recorded over 40 000 participants on dean gray tuesday the best of bootie mashup compilation series is compiled and produced each year by a plus d creators of the international mashup club bootie the compilations have been released in december every year since 2005 and are annual internet sensations with each album garnering over 5000gb of downloads in 2009 world famous audio hacker announced a project named the post turntablist spanning mash up and cut up styles releasing a new audio segement every two weeks that is produced to be joined into a final exquisite corpse of original mash ups and cut ups on the last week of the year beyond that several mashup albums have been released online or elsewhere one example being french bootlegger totom who released a mashup album trilogy focusing on nine inch nails notable mash up albums include while there is some overlap between the terms cut up and mash up the former has increasingly come to refer to pieces that rely on the humour of reconstructed spoken word and video material this may be due to the fact that the term cut up was used decades earlier by novelist and artist william s burroughs to refer to his literary cutups as well as his tape recorder experiments which featured spliced vocal tracks in the same way that his written cut ups literally cut up and rearranged various texts the best known cutups remix political speeches and rallies to satirical effect johan söderberg s endless love in which george w bush and tony blair appear to serenade each other like lovebirds chris morris bushwhacked a détournement of bush s 2003 state of the union address or sarkoskanking by polémix and la voix off a cut off of nicolas sarkozy s speeches notable cut up artists include cassetteboy osymyso rx cartel communique and evolution control committee visual artists involved with installation art performance art and vjing closely related to music production have recently taken up the concept of bastard pop in their work forerunners of the genre include eclectic method a british trio who have created mashups and video remixes for mtv they released the world s first audiovisual mashup dvd album we are not vjs in 2005 another notable visual artist is belgian artist danny devos who mashed up gordon matta clark s descending steps for batan and dan flavin s icon iv

the 1990s was the decade that ran from january 1 1990 to december 31 1999 during this time the widespread adoption of personal computers the internet and the increased economic productivity led to the equity market booms around the world and caused an influx of wealth to the united states canada europe and asia this decade started with the fall of the soviet union and the fighting of the gulf war in iraq and kuwait as well as the cementation of free market capitalism in many countries worldwide both developed and developing during this decade the gender roles for women changed dramatically in many industrialized countries as women assumed leadership and gained power in politics business and other aspects of life throughout the decade multiple attempts to solve the conflict between israeli and palestinian territories were initiated including a near settlement in the mid 1990s with the oslo accords when israel allowed the creation of the autonomous palestinian national authority also the 155 years of british control over hong kong ended with the transfer of jurisdiction to the people s republic of china in europe the decade was dominated by the yugoslav wars which resulted in the dissolution of yugoslavia as slovenia croatia bosnia and herzegovina and macedonia declared their independence many countries institutions companies and organizations were prosperous during the 1990s high income countries such as the united states south korea and those in western europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade however in the former soviet union gdp decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some capital flight occurred oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former soviet bloc leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations these trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the cold war led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens significant events that occurred during or after 1990 which would influence the course of history and character of the decade include significant events that marked the passing of the decade include some technologies invented and improved during the 1990s politically the 1990s was an era of spreading democracy the former countries of the warsaw pact moved from totalitarian regimes to democratically elected governments the same happened in other non communist countries such as taiwan chile south africa and indonesia capitalism made great changes to the economies of communist countries like china and vietnam and even cuba the improvement in relations between the countries of nato and the former members of the warsaw pact ended the cold war both in europe and other parts of the world yugoslavia violently broke up along republic and ethnic lines during the 1990s in 1993 the prime minister of israel yitzhak rabin and plo leader yasser arafat shook hands in agreement for peace at the conclusion of peace talks sponsored by us president bill clinton the outcome of these talks known as the oslo accords was an agreement by israel to allow palestinian self government conflicts like the balkan wars the rwandan genocide the battle of mogadishu in somalia and the first gulf war as well as the continuation of terrorism led some to hypothesize a clash of civilizations but the decade was also a time of peace in terror ridden northern ireland when the ira agreed to a truce in 1994 this marked the beginning of the end of 25 years of violence between the two sectarian groups protestant and catholic and the start of political negotiations 
varg vikernes born 11 february 1973 near bergen norway is a norwegian black metal musician convicted murderer and arsonist and far right political activist in 1991 vikernes conceived the one man music project burzum which quickly became popular within the early norwegian black metal scene later he became a prominent organizer for the heathen front and authored several writings on germanic neopaganism that were published in various underground publications in a documentary on heavy metal he was described as the most notorious metal musician of all time having served almost 16 years of a 21 year prison sentence it was announced on march 10 2009 that vikernes would be released on parole vikernes was sentenced to a 21 years in prison for the august 1993 murder of øystein aarseth of mayhem and for the burning of three christian churches in norway he was eligible for parole in spring 2008 after serving 15 years in prison but his application was denied a june 2008 newspaper article mentions that vikernes is married and has a fifteen year old daughter and a son in an interview made in 2004 vikernes said that he has a daughter and that he had never been married in a 2008 interview he referred to his two children as well as an expected third child in connection with his parole in march 2009 vikernes announced that he would be settling on a small farm in telemark with his family there exists no biography of him but some information can be gathered from the interviews he has given and from articles on the web page www burzum org both accounts are potentially tendentious michael moynihan one of the authors of lords of chaos has been described as quite active in the propaganda support network for vikernes burzum org on the other hand has not been noted at all by secondary sources in the interviews printed in lords of chaos vikernes talks a lot about his background and his childhood and even an interview with his mother lene bore is included in the 2004 interview vikernes mentions that she is working in a large oil company he also gives his father s profession as electronics engineer whereas his brother who is one and a half years older is a graduate civil engineer in the lords of chaos interview vikernes recalls an incident from his childhood when he was about 6 years old the family moved for about a year to baghdad iraq because vikernes father was working for saddam hussein developing a computer program since there were no places available in the english school in baghdad the young vikernes went to an iraqi elementary school during this time according to his interview vikernes here became aware of racial matters corporal punishment was not uncommon in the school and on one occasion vikernes had a quarrel with a teacher and called him a monkey but as vikernes perceived it the teachers didn t dare to hit me because i was white vikernes mother also recalls how they spent a year in iraq and that the other children in his class would get slapped by their teachers he would not she mentions that this created problems but generally she has no good explanation of how varg developed his views vikernes reveals slightly more in his interview when asked about his father he says that he had a swastika flag at home and that his father was hysterical about it however vikernes feels that his father was a hypocrite because he was worried about vikernes being a nazi whereas he too was pissed about all the colored people he saw in town about his mother vikernes says that she was very race conscious in the sense that she was afraid that vikernes was going to come home with a black girl at the time of the interview vikernes still had a positive relationship with his mother but very little contact with his father his parents are divorced vikernes father is said to have left about 10 years ago which would have been 1985 when vikernes was 12 there is some evidence that vikernes was involved with the skinhead scene in bergen before he became a part of the black metal scene goodrick clarke introduces burzum as the musical vehicle of the ex skinhead vikernes according to the encyclopedia of white power vikernes first became involved with the extreme right as a national socialist skinhead while he was an adolescent when he is asked in the interview in lords of chaos whether he hung out with skinheads in bergen vikernes boldly replies there were no skinheads in bergen he mentions though that he had short hair at that time and that he was into weapons that he liked the germans and hated the british and americans vikernes had been learning the guitar since he was 14 when he was about 17 vikernes came into contact with the members of the bergen death metal band old funeral he played guitar with them during 1990 1991 and performed on their devoured carcass ep in 1991 vikernes began a solo musical project named burzum and quickly became involved with the early norwegian black metal scene during 1992 1993 he recorded four albums as burzum that played a key role in the development of black metal vikernes has stated that for the recording of these early albums he used an old westone guitar bought in 1987 from an acquaintance he used the cheapest bass guitar there was in the shop and he borrowed drumsets from old funeral immortal and another musician living nearby on hvis lyset tar oss he borrowed hellhammer s drumset the same one hellhammer used to record de mysteriis dom sathanas by mayhem he used a peavey amplifier but for the recording of filosofem he used the amplifier on his brother s stereo and some old fuzz pedals for vocals he would use whatever microphone the sound tech handed him but during the recording of filosofem he intentionally used the worst mic they had a headset mic on the track dungeons of darkness he used the large gong at grieghallen for background noise on 6 june 1992 the fantoft stave church one of norway s architectural treasures dating from the 12th century was burned to the ground via arson by january 1993 arson attacks had occurred on at least seven other major stave churches including one on christmas eve of 1992 vikernes was found guilty of several of these cases the attempted arson of storetveit church in bergen and the arson of åsane church in bergen skjold church in vindafjord and holmenkollen chapel in oslo he was also charged with the arson of fantoft stave church although the jurors voted not guilty the judges called this an error but did not overthrow the whole case vikernes was rumored to have been motivated both by paganism and theistic satanism but has denied he was ever a satanist the first case of arson happened on 6 june 1992 and was widely rumored to have been started at 6am evoking the number of the beast although it was probably started earlier under cover of night in an interview with michael moynihan vikernes made a statement about the church burnings that hints at a heathen rather than a satanist motivation i am not going to say that i burnt any churches but let me put it this way there was one person who started it i was not found guilty of burning the fantoft stave church but anyway that was what triggered the whole thing that was the 6th of june and everyone linked it to satanism  what everyone overlooked was that on the 6th june year 793 in lindesfarne in britain was the site of the first known viking raid in history with vikings from hordaland which is my county in explaining the motives behind the church burnings vikernes said they desecrated our graves our burial mounds so it s revenge echoing this sentiment he writes in vargsmål for each devastated graveyard one heathen grave is avenged for each ten churches burnt to ashes one heathen hof is avenged for each ten priests or freemasons assassinated one heathen is avenged when asked whether the church burnings were linked to odinism or ásatrú he replied the point is that all these churches are linked to one person  who was not øystein obviously all the church burnings with the exception of stavanger because that was another group to coincide with the release of mayhem s de mysteriis dom sathanas vikernes and aarseth had conspired to blow up nidaros cathedral which appears on the album cover aarseth s murder in august 1993 put an end to this plan and delayed the album s release in late january 1993 vikernes was interviewed by a journalist from bergens tidende vikernes had requested the interview in order to gain publicity for the black metal scene and for aarseth s record store helvete however the interview led to a police investigation and vikernes was put under arrest for a week aarseth decided to close his record store due to this negative attention on 10 august 1993 vikernes and snorre ruch travelled from bergen to aarseth s apartment in oslo upon their arrival a confrontation began which ended when vikernes fatally stabbed aarseth his body was found outside the apartment with twenty three cut wounds  two to the head five to the neck and sixteen to the back the motive for the murder is completely unclear the entry on varg vikernes in the specialized encyclopedia of white power mentions that the murder has been variously described as a power struggle between rival leaders of a satanic circle a conflict over a girl s affection or a dispute over a record contract vikernes himself contends that aarseth planned to kill him and that he was striking first in self defense on his homepage vikernes elaborates that aarseth had plotted to torture him to death and videotape the event  using a meeting about an unsigned contract as a pretext on the night of the murder vikernes claims he intended to hand aarseth the signed contract and tell him to fuck off but that aarseth attacked him first additionally vikernes defends that most of aarseth s cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle after the slaying vikernes drove to a nearby lake to dispose of his bloodied clothes before he returned home at the arrest of vikernes a substantial amount of explosives was found in his possession vikernes has stated that they were intended to blow up blitz house the radical leftist and anarchist enclave in oslo a plan which was reportedly on the verge of execution and only prevented by vikernes arrest in an article originally published in 1999 kevin coogan points to vikernes planned attack in the blitz house as a possible motive for the murder of aarseth referring to the passages of lords of chaos quoted above coogan writes loc offers strong evidence that vikernes who came from a divorced family and was raised by his mother lene bore was a fascist well before he became a metalhead then he too mentions vikernes intent to destroy an oslo based punk anti fascist squat called blitz house and concludes vikernes may have felt that he had no choice but to kill euronymous before bombing blitz house because the communist would almost certainly have opposed such an act vikernes trial began on 2 may 1994 during the court case the 22 year old snorre ruch who drove vikernes to and from øystein s apartment and stood outside during the incident was put on trial together with vikernes and sentenced to 8 years of imprisonment vikernes was sentenced to 21 years of imprisonment the maximum sentence in norway he was found guilty of murdering øystein aarseth and the arson of several churches one of which involved jørn tunsberg of black metal band hades almighty in a controversial display vikernes smiled at the moment his verdict was read an image that was widely reprinted in the news media during his time in prison vikernes has recorded two albums which are composed of dark ambient songs vikernes was denied access to an electric guitar bass guitar or drums and instead used a synthesizer in 2000 vikernes terminated his musical project due to what he perceived to be negative notoriety he believed that his philosophy was constantly misinterpreted by an ignorant fan base that was too closely related to black metal and satanism through his website he has indicated that he intends to continue burzum upon his release from prison stating i will publish a few books possibly using a pseudonym in order to stay anonymous and perhaps a burzum album or two but that s it regarding the style of his next album vikernes stated on his website will as far as i can tell sound much like the old albums whether i like it or not because i m incapable of making music that doesn t sound rather burzumic in october 2003 vikernes failed to return to his low security prison in tønsberg norway after having been granted a short leave he was found riding in a stolen volvo car which according to the media contained an unloaded ag3 automatic rifle a handgun numerous large knives a gas mask camouflage clothing a laptop a compass a global positioning system various maps and a fake passport for this thirteen months were added to his sentence and he was then moved to a maximum security prison in trondheim he has since been moved again this time to tromsø prison when vikernes was convicted it was possible to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21 year sentence but in 2002 before he became eligible the norwegian parliament extended this to 14 years in june 2006 after serving 12 years vikernes was denied parole by the department of criminal justice for this reason his lawyer john christian elden has complained that the policy change is a form of retroactive legislation article 97 of the norwegian constitution prohibits any law being given retroactive force varg vikernes was denied parole again in june 2008 although he was allowed to leave tromsø prison for short periods to visit his family his full sentence would run for another seven years in march 2009 however vikernes parole was announced he had then served almost 16 years of his 21 year sentence vikernes stated numerous times in past interviews that he planned to move to a farm with his wife and children mentioning the fact that he planned to write books under a pen name or anonymously as well as recording a possible future album according to goodrick clarke while in jail vikernes began to formulate his nationalist heathen ideology using material from norse mythology combined with racism and occult national socialism goodrick clarke bases this account of vikernes beliefs on some articles that vikernes had written for the short lived neo nazi magazine filosofem published by vidar von herske goodrick clarke also uses the book lords of chaos and a manifesto called vargsmål which vikernes began to write after his imprisonment although some publishers were initially interested in vargsmål due to vikernes presence in the norwegian media they turned the book down as soon as they had the opportunity to read it as its contents were considered too extreme according to lords of chaos vargsmål became available on the internet for some time in 1996 but not in a printed form in 1997 a norwegian publisher released a paperback edition of the book its publication was financed by vikernes mother lene bore vikernes has denounced the english translation of his book in an article on his website there is also the homepage www burzum org which provides several articles allegedly written by vikernes there is however no third party source which confirms that the texts on that homepage were indeed written by him vikernes has written lyrics for several songs by darkthrone that make use of themes from old germanic folklore in these satan is brought up in the context of an eye that is a source of light with mentions of a spear and a hall of battle all of which are masked references to the germanic god odin this was done with the double meaning of odin as the adversary of jewish and christian tradition many have thus inferred that vikernes is or was a satanist though he has stated many times that he is opposed to satanism as he considers it to be a reactionary form of christianity according to vikernes christianity was created by some decadent and degenerated romans as a tool of oppression in the late roman era and it should be treated accordingly it is like handcuffs to the mind and spirit and is nothing but destructive to mankind in fact i don t really see christianity as a religion it is more like a spiritual plague a mass psychosis and it should first and foremost be treated as a problem to be solved by the medical science christianity is a diagnosis it s like islam and the other asian religions a hiv aids of the spirit and mind vikernes now embraces a modern scientific worldview resting on a foundation made up of the pagan values and ideals loyalty wisdom courage love discipline honesty intelligence beauty responsibility health and strength he draws a direct connection between both race and intelligence and intelligence and religion denouncing theism as mental enslavement fit only for inferior races vikernes goes on to say if it is supposed to serve a purpose paganism needs to be an ideology not a religion in addition to vargsmål works by vikernes on his personal world view include irminsûl and germansk mytologi og verdensanskuelse vikernes began identifying himself as a nazi after his conviction he founded the publisher and record label cymophane productions and in 1993 founded the racialist norsk hedensk front which grew into the allgermanische heidnische front his former ideas about neo nazism and fascism can be found in several small pamphlets vikernes states on his website that he no longer uses the term nazi as a self description however vikernes statements on his homepage concerning the nazi ghost are rather ambiguous the reason i have been drawn to and occasionally have expressed support for nazism is mainly because many of the norwegian nazis embraced our pagan religion as our blood religion and they rejected judeo christianity as jewish heresy  so since i am not a nazi i began to use another term in the late 90s i did it not just to avoid confusion but also to find a term more suitable and accurate than the other terms i had used this new term was odalism  it is a term not tainted by history yet of the nazi ghost he says the nazi ghost has scared millions of europeans from caring about their blood and homeland for sixty years now and it is about time we banish this ghost and again start to think and care about the things that are important to us in other texts on his homepage he still embraces racism and eugenics however he makes the point that following one s own culture is an equally valid and beneficial choice for all peoples vidkun quisling nazi collaborator minister president of occupied norway between 1942 and 1945 and involuntary originator of the term quisling regime had developed an extremely obscure esoteric doctrine labelled universism an online article about him mentions that the only modest intellectual influence he ever had with this doctrine was on certain extreme strains of norwegian black metal music this impression is indeed given in lords of chaos in the interview there varg vikernes is faced with the question whether quisling s religion was pagan or christian moynihan søderlind write vikernes has discovered his predecessor in vidkun quisling at one point he temporarily took the name kvisling but he explained this choice in vargsmål one of my foremothers was called susanne malene qisling she was born 06 02 1811 and dies 10 05 1891 qisling means that which stems from a division of kingly descendants in an interview available at www burzum com he said they ran like chickens leaving norway with absolutely no authorities and when vidkun quisling tried to bring order back he was thanked with a bullet in his heart after the war this is the only known instance of vikernes mentioning vidkun quisling besides lords of chaos on www burzum org vikernes does not mention vidkun quisling at all from an early age vikernes was fascinated with the fictional realm of middle earth created by j r r tolkien his stage name grishnackh is taken from that of a minor character in the two towers the name burzum meaning darkness was taken from the black speech inscribed on the one ring in the lord of the rings the inscription read ash nazg durbatulúk ash nazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum ishi krimpatul or in english one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them additionally before settling for burzum the band was initially named uruk hai vikernes interpreted the lord of the rings on his website allegedly showing the connections to paganism in the books american journalist michael moynihan wrote a book entitled lords of chaos the bloody rise of the satanic metal underground with co author didrik søderlind that is concerned with the events of the early black metal scene in norway there exist a few reviews of this book some of which note the political leanings of its main author some of which don t one extensive review has been written by kevin coogan who is otherwise known as the author of an acclaimed biography of the neo fascist writer and activist francis parker yockey in lords of chaos as coogan writes moynihan suggests that vikernes is an avatar of a long repressed odinist archetype analogous to what jung claimed for nazi germany in his famous 1936 essay on wotan the book s thesis about black metal as a rise of this odinist archetype is factually problematic loc s musings about fascism and black metal largely hang on a thin evidentiary thread varg vikemes there are also two different reviews of this book available that are allegedly written by varg vikernes one on www burzum org and one on www burzum com whereas the review on www burzum com is only mildly critical and states the book is pretty much objective the review on www burzum org states i dare say the vast majority of all the statements made in this book are either misinterpretations taken out of context misunderstandings malicious lies made by enemies a result of ignorance extreme exaggerations and or third hand information at best this includes the statements attributed to me  have no insight into or even good knowledge about the subjects discussed and  don t understand one bit what black metal was about on 1991 and 1992  they have managed to fill the heads of a generation of metal fans with lies torstein grude created a norwegian documentary entitled satan rir media to which vikernes has given a more positive review as its title implies the movie focuses on the often hysterical media coverage of the church burning cases and the black metal scene in general in the film vikernes accuses finn bjørn tønder of deliberately informing the police about his identity after he had completed an anonymous interview vikernes was arrested only hours after the interview one day before it was published and was released after a week in prison due to lack of proof in the film svein erik krogvoll evades the question whether tønder preserved vikernes anonymity by stating it was all ok and legal according to satan rir media it was also the bt who gave vikernes the name greven however vikernes has said in vargsmål that he reason i chose this name was not to have a tough name the word count comes from the latin word comtes that means partner or companion i am the true germanic folk s partner and companion and with that i chose this title satan rir media claims that by emphasizing the satanist angle the norwegian news media unwittingly created a mass following for burzum and vikernes both in norway and internationally as burzum other appearances 
animal collective is a musical collective originally from baltimore maryland animal collective consists of avey tare panda bear deakin or deacon as spelled on strawberry jam and geologist records released under the name animal collective may include contributions from any or all of these members the lineup is not uniform the band members met in school and started recording together in various forms of collaboration from a young age although the band is often classified as psych folk or noise rock it is hard to define the animal collective sound as they often experiment with diverse styles and ideas from album to album the group also runs the record label paw tracks on which they have released their own material as well that of other artists animal collective grew out of the roots of childhood friendships in baltimore county noah lennox and dibb met in the second grade and became good friends panda went away to pennsylvania for high school while dibb attended the park school of baltimore where avey tare and recent philadelphia transplant geologist went avey geologist and deakin were in an indie rock band called automine with schoolmates brendan fowler and david shpritz deakin introduced panda to avey and geologist the four of them played music in different variations and often solo swapping homemade recordings and sharing ideas lennox and dibb both went off to college in the boston area while avey and geologist attended schools in new york city panda and deakin assembled panda s eponymous debut album panda bear during this time from the multitude of recordings panda had made in the previous years and established their own label soccer star records to release it avey was also working on a record which would eventually become spirit they re gone spirit they ve vanished avey asked panda to play drums on the record which was released under the name avey tare and panda bear soccer star morphed into the animal label with the intention of putting out music that came from the four musicians panda and deakin left school and moved to new york in 2000 around the time of spirit they re gone spirit they ve vanished the group s music became much more collaborative in nature and avey and panda began playing clubs around new york geologist soon came on board and began performing with the group much of the live material from this time would eventually end up on danse manatee on the catsup plate label danse manatee was released in 2001 under the name of avey tare panda bear and geologist this process of preparing material in the live setting and then recording and often retiring songs would become a hallmark of animal collective the group s first tour with friends black dice was captured on the 2002 album hollinndagain the live album was released by st ives a boutique label run by secretly canadian which releases limited edition vinyl only records limited to 300 copies each of which featured a one of a kind handmade cover hollinndagain is among the rarest of animal collective artifacts hollinndagain was re released both on cd and vinyl on october 31 2006 through the paw tracks label at this point deakin began to perform with the group the next album to be released was campfire songs again working with catsup plate in 2003 the campfire songs concept and some of the material dated back to the earliest avey tare and panda bear shows in new york recorded live in 2001 on a screened in porch in monkton maryland the record is one take of five songs played straight through attempting to make a record as warm and inviting as a campfire the band recorded their performance straight to minidisc with one recorder outside to grab the ambient sound of the environment field recordings of the surrounding area were also added in 2002 animal collective also attained notoriety for their appearance on arto lindsay s album invoke worrying that avey tare panda bear deakin and geologist would be too long winded a moniker and with record companies advising that a unifying name would be necessary for the marketplace the group decided to adopt a catch all name using their old label of animal as inspiration they picked animal collective this formation was to be different from a straightforward band giving the musicians the freedom to work in combinations of two to four as dictated by the project at hand or their mood their first entry under this name was here comes the indian which was released in 2003 by their newly formed record label paw tracks paw tracks was formed with todd hyman from carpark records animal collective makes decisions on what paw tracks would release while hyman runs the day to day operations the group was happy to find someone like hyman who had experience running a label and was dedicated to the group s music the animal label was more or less abandoned upon the formation of paw tracks here comes the indian was the first record to feature all four of animal collective and its dense textures and energetic performances widened the exposure of the group significantly the two releases in 2003 attracted much attention and the group began a relationship with one of their new admirers the fat cat records label the first fat cat release from the collective was a double disc package of spirit and danse manatee which were previously only available or well known in and around new york after the dense soundscapes of here comes the indian avey and panda decided to concentrate on more stripped down material each of them began composing material and they performed as a duo usually with just acoustic guitars a single drum some effects and their voices the duo toured the world for the better part of a year with this new material opening for múm and four tet among others before retreating to lamar colorado to record the material with rusty santos a new york musician and friend the result was sung tongs released on fat cat records in 2004 sung tongs received a great deal of critical acclaim for its strong harmonies exotic textures hummable melodies and free wheeling nature the group was introduced to vashti bunyan in scotland by kieran hebden who had recently played in bunyan s band being fans of the cult folk singer s 1970 album just another diamond day the group started a friendship with bunyan and asked her to collaborate on some recordings the group encouraged her to sing lead vocals on three songs left over from the sung tongs era released on the prospect hummer ep in early 2005 the release led to a fat cat records signing for vashti bunyan who finally wrote recorded and released a second album ending a thirty year hiatus in october 2005 animal collective released their highly anticipated seventh album feels was met with acclaim from fans and critics both again the work of all four members of the collective feels was recorded in seattle with scott colburn known for his work with the sun city girls following the release of feels animal collective mounted their most extensive tour which lasted into the fall of 2006 and saw them visit australia and new zealand for the first time in addition to many european festivals and north american dates including a headline set of the carling tent at the reading and leeds festival during their 2005 and 2006 tours animal collective debuted several new songs then only known by their working titles reverend green fireworks  chores  1 safer peace bone cuckoo and street flash most of these appear on their 2007 album strawberry jam some under a slightly altered title in the late fall of 2006 animal collective released people in australia as a 7 on their australian label spunk records and worldwide as a 12 and cd ep in early 2007 on fatcat records it contains three studio songs people tiwkid and my favorite colors as well as a live version of people in january 2007 domino recording company announced that they would be releasing the new then still unnamed animal collective album on july 4 2007 strawberry jam was leaked online the album was released in the u s on september 11 2007 the album received immediate praise due in part to a strong focus on vocals songs such as for reverend green serve as a showcase for the dynamic vocal range of avey tare further the album closer derek is reminiscent of the sound developed on panda bear s person pitch march 20 2007 saw the release of panda bear s solo album person pitch a series of eps and singles led up to that release beginning with i m not b w comfy in nautica on united acoustic recordings bro s a 12 on fat cat and most recently carrots a split with excepter on paw tracks the album received much acclaim including album of the year from pitchfork media on april 27 2007 avey tare released an album pullhair rubeye with his wife kria brekken formerly of the icelandic band múm the album is noted for the tracks being completely reversed the band toured extensively throughout 2007 completing several american and european tours they played without deakin who decided to take time off from the band beginning in may 2007 the band debuted a brand new batch of post strawberry jam live songs these songs were written in an intense two week session before the tour months before the release of strawberry jam on october 5 2007 the band in its full four man line up made their national television debut on late night with conan o brien performing the song 1 in support of strawberry jam during their live shows in 2007 and 2008 animal collective began reinvigorating older songs with new beats songs such as doggy hey light chocolate girl essplode leaf house who could win a rabbit grass and lablakely dress received makeovers and were frequently inserted into the live sets this remixing process has become a way to incorporate medleys into their live sets referencing their back catalogue with short samples an example of a medley that the band performed in 2008 was lablakely dress segueing into fireworks into essplode back into fireworks water curses ep leaked on march 12 2008 and was released on may 5 2008 on april 9 the song water curses was released by itself digitally in early 2008 and still as a three piece the collective entered the studio to record tracks for their eighth studio album the album entitled merriweather post pavilion was officially announced on the band s official website on october 5 2008 and was released january 6 2009 the track listing was subsequently released on the same website on october 8 and the album was eventually leaked on december 25 2008 even before the record was released several music magazines and websites started to refer to it as the best album of 2009 while uncut magazine called it one of the landmark american albums of the century so far the band set to tour throughout europe and us in 2009 notably being one of the headlining acts at september s atp new york festival where panda bear is also performing a solo set on an interview with avey tare and panda bear on npr it was stated that animal collective were working on a movie with danny perez who directed the music video for the single who could win a rabbit the movie feature visuals to accompany their music panda bear stated they would like to create a movie that would have visuals similar to what somebody would see if they closed their eyes while listening to animal collective s music as well geologist stated that it s the most experimental stuff we ve ever done according to a march 2009 interview the film will debut in the summer of 2009 starting with the first tour dates in 2009 the band introduced a new song what would i want sky to the audience this song was also part of a bbc session recording on march 18 catsup plate opened a charity auction on ebay for the test pressings of the long awaited animal collective live boxed set animal crack box all proceeds of the auction will go to médecins sans frontières panda bear terrestrial tones jane

the theremin is an early electronic musical instrument controlled without contact from the player it is named after its russian inventor professor leon theremin who patented the device in 1928 it was originally known as the termenvox or aetherphone the former of which was subsequently anglicised to theremin ipa ˈθɛrəmɪn the controlling section usually consists of two metal antennas which sense the position of the player s hands and control radio frequency oscillator for frequency with one hand and volume with the other the electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker the theremin is associated with an eerie sound which has led to its use in movie soundtracks such as those in spellbound the lost weekend and the day the earth stood still theremins are also used in art music and in popular music genres such as rock the theremin was originally the product of russian government sponsored research into proximity sensors the instrument was invented by a young russian physicist named lev sergeivich termen in 1919 after the outbreak of the russian civil war after positive reviews at moscow electronics conferences theremin demonstrated the device to bolshevik leader vladimir lenin lenin was so impressed with the device that he began taking lessons in playing it commissioned six hundred of the instruments for distribution throughout the soviet union and sent theremin on a trip around the world to demonstrate the latest soviet technology and the invention of electronic music after a lengthy tour of europe during which time he demonstrated his invention to packed houses theremin found his way to the united states where he patented his invention in 1928 subsequently theremin granted commercial production rights to rca although the rca thereminvox released immediately following the stock market crash of 1929 was not a commercial success it fascinated audiences in america and abroad clara rockmore a well known thereminist toured to wide acclaim performing a classical repertoire in concert halls around the united states often sharing the bill with paul robeson in 1938 theremin left the united states though the circumstances related to his departure are in dispute many accounts claim he was taken from his new york city apartment by kgb agents taken back to the soviet union and made to work in a sharashka laboratory prison camp at magadan siberia he reappeared 30 years later in his 2000 biography of the inventor theremin ether music and espionage albert glinsky suggested the russian had fled to escape crushing personal debts and was then caught up in stalin s political purges in any case theremin did not return to the united states until 1991 after a flurry of interest in america following the end of the second world war the theremin soon fell into disuse with serious musicians mainly because newer electronic instruments were introduced that were easier to play however a niche interest in the theremin persisted mostly among electronics enthusiasts and kit building hobbyists one of these electronics enthusiasts robert moog began building theremins in the 1950s while he was a high school student moog subsequently published a number of articles about building theremins and sold theremin kits which were intended to be assembled by the customer moog credited what he learned from the experience as leading directly to his groundbreaking synthesizer the moog since the release of the film theremin an electronic odyssey in 1994 the instrument has enjoyed a resurgence in interest and has become more widely used by contemporary musicians even though many theremin sounds can be approximated on many modern synthesizers some musicians continue to appreciate the expressiveness novelty and uniqueness of using an actual theremin the film itself has garnered excellent reviews today moog music dan burns of soundslikeburns com chuck collins of theremaniacs com wavefront technologies kees enkelaar and harrison instruments manufacture performance quality theremins theremin kit building remains popular with electronics buffs kits are available from moog music theremaniacs harrison instruments paia electronics and jaycar on the other end of the scale many low end theremins some of which have only pitch control are offered online and offline sometimes advertised as toys some enthusiasts prefer to go the old fashioned route and design and build their own vacuum tube theremins given the relatively high prices and rarity of rca originals notable designers are art harrison and mark keppinger design schematics are available on the internet for the interested hobbyist vacuum tube theremins are difficult projects and should not be undertaken lightly by beginners the theremin is unique among musical instruments in that it is played without physical contact the musician stands in front of the instrument and moves his or her hands in the proximity of two metal antennas the distance from one antenna determines frequency and the distance from the other controls amplitude most frequently the right hand controls the pitch and the left controls the volume although some performers reverse this arrangement some low cost theremins use a conventional knob operated volume control and have only the pitch antenna the theremin uses the heterodyne principle to generate an audio signal the instrument s circuitry includes two radio frequency oscillators one oscillator operates at a fixed frequency the frequency of the other oscillator is controlled by the performer s distance from the pitch control antenna the performer s hand acts as the grounded plate of a variable capacitor in an l c circuit the difference between the frequencies of the two oscillators at each moment allows the creation of a difference tone in the audio frequency range resulting in audio signals that are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker to control volume the performer s other hand acts as the grounded plate of another variable capacitor in this case the capacitor detunes another oscillator which affects the amplifier circuit the distance between the performer s hand and the volume control antenna determines the capacitor s value which regulates the theremin s volume easy to learn but notoriously difficult to master theremin performance presents two challenges reliable control of the instrument s pitch with no guidance and minimizing undesired portamento that is inherent in the instrument s microtonal design pitch control is challenging because like a violin or trombone a theremin generates tones of any pitch throughout its entire range including those that lie between the conventional notes in the case of some string instruments the range is divided along the strings by use of length divisions by contrast in the case of the theremin the entire range of pitches is controlled by the distance of the performer s hand or fingers to the pitch antenna in mid air precise control of manual position coupled with an excellent sense of pitch is required since the electromagnetic field around the antenna tends to change slowly over time resulting in changing positions of individual pitches also the theremin s continuous range of pitches lends itself to glissando playing which can be inappropriate to the piece being performed skilled performers through rapid and exact hand movements minimize undesired portamento and glissando to play individual notes and can even achieve staccato effects small and rapid movements of the hands can create tremolo or vibrato effects although pitch is governed primarily by the distance of the performer s hand to the pitch antenna most precision thereminists augment their playing techniques with a system called aerial fingering largely devised by clara rockmore and subsequently adapted by leon theremin and his protege lydia kavina it employs specific hand and finger positions to alter slightly the amount of capacitance relative to the pitch antenna to produce small changes in tone quickly and in a manner that can be reliably reproduced an alternate and controversial hands on technique is called angling in which the pitch control hand is actually set on the top of the theremin which violates the no touch creed of traditionalists it employs changing the angle of the hand and fingers to alter the pitch and repositioning the hand if the pitch interval is too large for angling by touching the instrument the effect on pitch of extraneous movement is dampened this permits the use of steady pitches without vibrato and without remaining perfectly still there is also a way to ensure that when moving around unnecessary sound is not produced by using the pitch knob on the side of the instrument and turning it until no sound is made when a body is around the instrument equally important in theremin articulation is the use of the volume control antenna unlike touched instruments where simply halting play or damping a resonator silences the instrument the thereminist must play the rests as well as the notes as ms rockmore observes although volume technique is less developed than pitch technique some thereminists have worked to extend it especially pamelia kurstin s walking bass technique skilled players who overcome these challenges by a precisely controlled combination of movements can achieve complex and expressive performances and thus realize a theremin s potential some thereminists in the avant garde openly rebel against developing any formalized technique viewing it as imposing traditional limitations on an instrument that is inherently free form these players choose to develop their own highly personalized techniques the question of the relative value of formal technique versus free form performances is hotly debated among thereminists theremin artist anthony ptak uses antenna interference in live performance recent versions of the theremin has been functionally updated the moog ethervox while functionally still a theremin can also be used as a midi controller and as such the artist is able to control any midi compatible synthesizer with it using the theremin s continuous pitch to drive modern synths theremins are popular instruments among avant garde and new music artists because of their perceived freedom from traditional compositional structures it is also performed as a classical instrument and is occasionally used in jazz improvisation concert composers who have written for theremin include lera auerbach bohuslav martinů dmitri shostakovich charles ives percy grainger christian wolff joseph schillinger alan hovhaness edgar varese moritz eggert iraida yusupova jorge antunes vladimir komarov anis fuleihan and dalit warshaw a recent concert composition utilizing the theremin is lera auerbach s ballet the little mermaid a three hour production featuring the theremin as the mermaid s voice throughout the royal danish ballet commissioned russian north american composer auerbach to make a modern rendition of this fairy tale it premiered on april 15 2005 with lydia kavina as the theremin soloist kavina also performed in olga neuwirth s opera bählamms fest which premiered in 1999 elizabeth brown composed rural electrification a chamber opera for voice theremin and recorded sound as well as piranesi for theremin and string quartet and atlantis for theremin and guitar dalit warshaw a student of clara rockmore is a composer pianist and thereminist who has performed on the instrument with such ensembles as the new york philharmonic and the royal stockholm philharmonic among others works written for theremin by dalit warshaw have been performed at lincoln center steinway hall and at the l a philharmonic s disney hall russian thereminist and composer lydia kavina is widely regarded as the greatest living theremin virtuoso she is the niece of one of léon theremin s first degree cousins kavina was theremin s protégé her repertoire consists primarily of classical and neo classical compositions many of which were written for the instrument many thereminists have studied under or played ms kavina including german thereminists barbara buchholz and carolina eyck english thereminists bruce woolley and charlie draper miss hypnotique and japanese thereminist masami takeuchi in the united states pamelia kurstin performs as a thereminist whose eclectic styles and innovations continue to expand the instrument s range her performances encompass the classical and jazz idioms as well as in ethnic and avant rock music with the band barbez more recently the armenian thereminist armen ra has promoted the instrument by performing popular classical and armenian music on the instruments other american performers of note include jazz thereminists eric ross and kip rosser canadian singer songwriter peter pringle missouri based thereminist and organist kevin kissinger charles richard lester michael hearst rupert chappelle and thomas grillo based in mississippi dorit chrysler rob schwimmer and john hoge all three in new york city in mexico ernesto mendoza has played the theremin in workshops demonstrations and concerts cristian torres has done similar work to promote the theremin in chile and raul dente in argentina claudio sanchez of coheed and cambria often uses a theremin during live performances it can be seen in the band s neverender dvd theremins and theremin like sounds started to be incorporated into popular music from the end of the 1940s and this continued with varying popularity to the present contrary to popular belief the theremin was not used on the 1966 recording of good vibrations by the beach boys which featured paul tanner s box later called the electro theremin however for concert appearances an oscillator slide controller was designed and built for wilson by robert moog wilson helped to popularize the instrument when he recorded paul tanner playing his electro theremin for the first time in recorded music history on the song i just wasn t made for these times the song appeared on the beach boys 1966 album pet sounds considered one of the most influential albums in popular music history it is also worth mentioning the use of a theremin by the led zeppelin leader and guitarist jimmy page on their succesful whole lotta love mostly noticed on their live album the song remains the same published in 1976 the lothars are a boston area band formed in early 1997 whose cds have featured as many as four theremins played at once a first for pop music although credited with a theramin on the mysterons track from album dummy portishead used a monophonic synthesizer to achieve theremin like effects instead aucouturier and pachet s measurement system noted it had the same theremin like ambience as alan stivell s arvor you the russian dmitri shostakovich was one of the first composers to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces including a use in his score for the 1931 film odna while the theremin was not widely used in classical music performances the instrument found great success in many motion pictures notably spellbound the red house the lost weekend the spiral staircase the day the earth stood still the thing the ten commandments more recent appearances in film scores include monster house ed wood and the machinist the dvds for ed wood bartleby and the day the earth stood still contain short features on the theremin robby virus the founder and theremin player of the band project pimento was featured on the soundtrack to the movie hellboy throughout the theremin s use in film music from the 1940s to the 1960s its sound was equated with the bizarre and alien because of clara rockmore s professed distaste for such projects the thereminist most commonly enlisted to perform anything from haunting melodies to eerie sound effects was dr samuel hoffman whose performances can be heard most prominently in the soundtracks for spellbound and the day the earth stood still ronald stein was a composer of soundtracks who also played theremin for movies such as the she creature and the queen of blood actor jerry lewis plays a theremin briefly in the 1957 paramount film the delicate delinquent the latter part of the scene actually uses thereminist samuel hoffman in the soundtrack to which jerry lewis mimes the motions of playing the instrument it is often believed that the theremin was used for the soundtrack of forbidden planet in fact louis and bebe barron built oscillator circuits and a ring modulator to create the electronic tonalities for the film bruce woolley provided all the theremin parts for storm the title song of the avengers movie and also the sound of music sequence in baz luhrmann s moulin rouge philadelphia thereminist howard mossman provided the theremin music for jens lien s 2006 award winning film the bothersome man using an rca theremin los angeles based thereminist charles richard lester is featured on the soundtrack of monster house and has performed the us premiere of gavriil popov s 1932 score for komsomol patron of electrification with the l a philharmonic and esa pekka salonen in 2007 in the 2007 biopic parody film walk hard the dewey cox story dewey cox suggests to one of his band members that he open his mind and learn to play the theremin it comes at a time when dewey is using lsd pretty heavily and has been working on his masterpiece album which is one very long song with countless obscure instruments a full symphony a vocal accompaniment of indigenous australians and a goat the scene is a parody of brian wilson the driving force of the beach boys and the album pet sounds composer garry schyman used a theremin for the musical score of the 2005 videogame destroy all humans lydia kavina s solo theremin is featured on the soundtrack for the 2006 mmorpg computer game soul of the ultimate nation composed by howard shore the third episode of strong bad s cool game for attractive people baddest of the bands features

the usb mass storage device class or usb msc or ums is a set of computing communications protocols defined by the usb implementers forum that run on the universal serial bus the standard provides an interface to a variety of storage devices some of the devices which are connected to computers via this standard are devices which support this standard are referred to as msc devices while msc is the official abbreviation ums has become common in on line jargon most current mainstream operating systems include support for usb mass storage devices although support on older systems is available through patches windows 95 osr2 1 an update to the operating system featured very limited support for usb during that time no generic usb mass storage driver was produced by microsoft even for windows 98 this meant that a device specific driver was needed for each type of usb storage device today generic drivers which support usb flash drives even in windows 98 are available as free downloads by 2000 the problem was almost solved products designed for windows me and windows 2000 are only fully corrected in subsequent oses on windows server 2003 however a drive letter has to be assigned to it in order to access it this can be done in disk management storage disk management there is no native support for usb in windows nt earlier versions of windows or ms dos although some third party solutions exist for each os a third party driver for windows 98 and windows 98se is also now available there is also a usb ums driver for windows nt 4 freedos supports usb mass storage as aspi devices windows mobile supports accessing most usb mass storage devices formatted with fat on devices with usb host although portable devices typically cannot provide enough power for disk enclosures containing hard drives on the other way around windows mobile devices can not show their file systems as a mass storage device unless the device implementer explicitly decides to add such functionality however third party applications exist to add msc emulation to most wm devices generally only memory cards can be exported and not internal storage memory due to the complications outlined below apple computer s mac os 8 5 1 supports usb mass storage through an optional driver mac os 9 and mac os x support usb mass storage natively the linux kernel has supported usb mass storage devices via a generic driver since kernel version 2 4 and a backport to kernel 2 2 has also been made solaris also supports devices since the 2 8 release and up netbsd since the 1 5 release

filesystem aros an open source amigaos clone for intel based pcs does support uhci and ohci usb root hubs but does not yet support usb mass storage class the xbox 360 and playstation 3 support most mass storage devices independent developers have released drivers for the ti 84 plus and ti 84 plus silver edition in order to access usb mass storage devices usb8x contains the driver for this access while msd8x handles the user interface the usb mass storage specification does not require any particular file system to be used on conforming devices instead it provides a simple interface to read and write sectors of data much like the low level interface used to access any hard drive using the scsi transparent command set operating systems may treat the usb drive like a hard drive and can format it with any file system they like because of its ubiquity and relative simplicity the most common file system on embedded devices such as usb flash drives cameras or digital audio players is microsoft s fat or fat32 file system with support for long names large usb based hard disks may come formatted with ntfs which is much less supported outside microsoft windows however a keydrive or any other device may be formatted using another filesystem of course this choice may limit other operating systems ability to access the contents of the device in cameras mp3 players and similar gadgets which must access the file system independently from an external host the fat filesystem is typically preferred by device manufacturers many modern hard drives support additional advanced commands such as native command queuing which may increase performance and s m a r t which allows a computer to measure various indicators of drive reliability these exist as extensions to the basic low level command sets used by hard drives such as scsi sata or pata these features do not work when hard drives are encapsulated in a disk enclosure supporting the usb mass storage interface usb mass storage provides a generic interface which only provides basic read write commands as outlined above this works perfectly well for basic data transfer using hard drive based devices however it means that there is no simple way to send advanced device specific commands to usb mass storage devices the new esata standard for external drives promises to address this issue since it extends the internal sata bus to external disks without any intermediate translation layer 
a formant is an acoustic resonance and in speech science and phonetics a resonance of the human vocal tract it is often measured by a peak in the frequency spectrum of the sound using a spectrogram or a spectrum analyzer though in vowels spoken with a high fundamental frequency as in a female or child voice the formant may lie between the widely spread harmonics and not be visible as a peak in acoustics it refers to resonance in sound sources notably musical instruments as well as that of sound chambers however it is equally valid to talk about the formant frequencies of the air in a room as exploited for example by alvin lucier in his piece i am sitting in a room formants are the distinguishing or meaningful frequency components of human speech and of singing by definition the information that humans require to distinguish between vowels can be represented purely quantitatively by the frequency content of the vowel sounds formants are the characteristic partials that identify vowels to the listener most of these formants are produced by tube and chamber resonance but a few whistle tones derive from periodic collapse of venturi effect low pressure zones the formant with the lowest frequency is called f1 the second f2 and the third f3 most often the two first formants f1 and f2 are enough to disambiguate the vowel these two formants determine the quality of vowels in terms of the open close and front back dimensions thus the first formant f1 has a higher frequency for an open vowel and a lower frequency for a close vowel or and the second formant f2 has a higher frequency for a front vowel and a lower frequency for a back vowel vowels will almost always have four or more distinguishable formants sometimes there are more than six however the first two formants are most important in determining vowel quality and this is often displayed in terms of a plot of the first formant against the second formant though this is not sufficient to capture some aspects of vowel quality such as rounding nasals usually have an additional formant around 2500 hz the liquid usually has an extra formant at 1500 hz while the english r sound is distinguished by virtue of a very low third formant plosives modify the placement of formants in the surrounding vowels bilabial sounds cause a lowering of the formants velar sounds almost always show f2 and f3 coming together in a velar pinch before the velar and separating from the same pinch as the velar is released alveolar sounds cause less systematic changes in neighboring vowel formants depending partially on exactly which vowel is present the time course of these changes in vowel formant frequencies are referred to as formant transitions if the fundamental frequency of the underlying vibration is higher than the formant frequency of the system then the character of the sound imparted by the formant frequencies will be mostly lost this is most apparent in the example of soprano opera singers who sing high enough that their vowels become very hard to distinguish control of formants is an essential component of the vocal technique known as overtone singing in which the performer sings a low fundamental tone and creates sharp resonances to select upper harmonics giving the impression of several tones being sung at once spectrograms are used to visualise formants studies of the frequency spectrum of trained singers especially male singers indicate a clear formant around 3000 hz that is absent in speech or in the spectra of untrained singers it is this increase in energy at 3000hz which allows singers to be heard and understood over an orchestra which peak at much lower frequencies of around 500 hz this formant is actively developed through vocal training for instance through so called voce di strega or witch s voice exercises and is caused by a part of the vocal tract acting as a resonator 
a keytar is a relatively lightweight keyboard or synthesizer that is supported by a strap around the neck and shoulders similar to the way a guitar is supported by a guitar strap keytars allow players a greater range of movement compared to conventional keyboards which are placed on stands the instrument has a musical keyboard for triggering musical notes and sounds controls for pitch bends vibrato portamento and sustain are placed on the instrument s neck the keytar was developed by anthony masakowski and commercially introduced in 1980 as the moog liberation early users included spyro gyra keyboardist tom schuman and the band devo the word keytar is a portmanteau of keyboard and guitar so keyboardists can feel more important an early printed use of the term keytar was in 1980 in an interview with jeffrey abbott by tom lounges of illianabeat magazine the keytar was made popular in the 1980s by glam metal bands as well as synthpop and new wave groups changing trends in music diminished the keytar s popularity shortly thereafter the keytar has enjoyed new visibility due in part to software innovations from companies like musiclab ultimatesoundbank while edgar winter often performed with a keyboard slung around his neck in the early 1970s it was not a keytar it was an arp 2600 keyboard with a shoulder strap added wayne famous of the 1980s band the producers also strapped on a regular oberheim synthesizer which caused him to develop back problems roland ceased production of its ax 7 model in early 2007 in january 2009 the company announced the forthcoming release of roland ax synth shoulder synthesizer with an axe shape design and an internal sound module as an improvement to ax 7 which had no built in sounds ax synth also has further improvements such as usb connectivity the moog liberation was released in 1980 by moog music it included two monophonic vcos and a polyphonic section that could play organ sounds the neck had spring loaded wheels for filter cutoff modulation and volume as well as a ribbon controlled pitch bend the liberation had a single vcf and two ads envelope generators the roland sh 101 is a small 32 key monophonic analog synthesizer from the early 1980s it has one oscillator with two waveforms an octave divided sub oscillator and a low pass filter vcf capable of self oscillation when a shoulder strap is connected to it and the small handgrip with a pitch bend wheel and a pitch modulation trigger is used the sh 101 becomes a keytar the yamaha shs 10 from the late 1980s has a small keyboard with 32 minikeys and a pitch bend wheel an internal frequency modulation synthesizer offering 25 different voices with 6 note polyphony onboard voices include a range of keyboard instruments strings and wind and brass the roland ax 7 which was manufactured from 2001 to 2007 contains many more advanced features than early keytars it has 45 velocity sensitive keys and a 3 character led display several features aimed towards stage performance are present such as a pitch bend ribbon touchpad like expression bar sustain switch and volume control knob all on the upper neck of the instrument there is also a proprietary d beam interface made up of infrared sensors that detect nearby motion this interface can be used to trigger and control effects on march 8th 2009 during the 3rd night of a phish reunion page mcconnell played a keytar during the song frankenstein at the hampton coliseum while some inexpensive children s toys are manufactured in the same shape as a keytar and marketed with the keytar name these toys have very limited capabilities they can typically only perform one note at a time or in some cases two note polyphony professional models allow the performer to play many notes at once as well the sound quality for the samples or synthesis is usually very rudimentary instrument builder vinson williams developed two instruments which he calls keytars the keytar v 1 and the keytar v 2 unlike the synthesizer based moog liberation and the yamaha and roland keytars which descended from it william s keytar combines a guitar body with strummable metal strings and a piano keyboard instead of a fretboard for allowing the keys to sound the strings while william s instrument shares the keytar name its use of strings and its clavinet style fretting mechanisms puts it in a different category like the clavinet william s instrument uses rubber pads which when depressed fret the otherwise damped strings unlike the clavinet which relies solely on the impact of fretting to sound a note however the williams instrument allows the strings to be plucked or strummed by hand keytars reached their height of popularity in the 1980s and were strongly associated with the new wave music of the time in the 1990s and early 2000s they were extremely unfashionable however with the synthpop revival of the late 2000s they are once again hip with synthpop revivalists like cobra starship and lights using them 
the voyager golden record is a phonograph record included in the two voyager spacecraft launched in 1977 it contains sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on earth it is intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form or far future humans that may find it the voyager spacecrafts are not heading towards any particular star but in about 40 000 years voyager 1 will be within 1 6 light years of the star ac 79 3888 in the ophiuchus constellation as the probes are extremely small compared to the vastness of interstellar space it is extraordinarily unlikely that they will ever be accidentally encountered if they are ever found by an alien species it will most likely be far in the future and thus the record is best seen as a time capsule or a symbolic statement rather than an attempt to communicate with extraterrestrial life as of 2008 the voyager spacecrafts became the third and fourth human artifacts to escape entirely from the solar system pioneers 10 and 11 which were launched in 1972 and 1973 and preceded voyager in outstripping the gravitational attraction of the sun both carried small metal plaques identifying their time and place of origin for the benefit of any other spacefarers that might find them in the distant future with this example before them nasa placed a more comprehensive message aboard voyager 1 and 2 a kind of time capsule intended to communicate a story of our world to extraterrestrials the contents of the record were selected for nasa by a committee chaired by carl sagan of cornell university dr sagan and his associates assembled 115 images and a variety of natural sounds such as those made by surf wind and thunder and animal sounds including the songs of birds and whales to this they added musical selections from different cultures and eras spoken greetings in fifty five languages and printed messages from president jimmy carter and u n secretary general kurt waldheim after nasa had received criticism over the nudity on the pioneer plaque the agency chose not to allow sagan and his colleagues to include a photograph of a nude man and woman on the record instead only a silhouette of the couple was included here is an excerpt of president carter s official statement placed on the voyager spacecraft for its trip outside our solar system june 16 1977 we cast this message into the cosmos of the 200 billion stars in the milky way galaxy some perhaps many may have inhabited planets and space faring civilizations if one such civilization intercepts voyager and can understand these recorded contents here is our message we are trying to survive our time so we may live into yours we hope some day having solved the problems we face to join a community of galactic civilizations this record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe the 115 images are encoded in analogue form the remainder of the record is audio designed to be played at 16⅔ revolutions per minute the first audio section contains spoken greetings in the following 55 languages listed here in alphabetical order the next audio section is devoted to the sounds of earth that include included within the sounds of earth audio portion of the golden record is a track containing the inspirational message ad astra per aspera in morse code translated from latin it means through hardships to the stars following the section on the sounds of earth there is an eclectic 90 minute selection of music from many cultures including eastern and western classics the selections include sagan had originally asked for permission to include here comes the sun from the beatles album abbey road while the beatles favoured it emi opposed it and the song was not included the golden records also carried an hour long recording of the brainwaves of ann druyan in the epilogue of the book billions and billions she describes the experience earlier i had asked carl if those putative extraterrestrials of a billion years from now could conceivably interpret the brain waves of a meditator who knows a billion years is a long long time was his reply on the chance that it might be possible why don t we give it a try two days after our life changing phone call i entered a laboratory at bellevue hospital in new york city and was hooked up to a computer that turned all the data from my brain and heart into sound i had a one hour mental itinerary of the information i wished to convey i began by thinking about the history of earth and the life it sustains to the best of my abilities i tried to think something of the history of ideas and human social organization i thought about the predicament that our civilization finds itself in and about the violence and poverty that make this planet a hell for so many of its inhabitants toward the end i permitted myself a personal statement of what it was like to fall in love the record is constructed of gold plated copper there is an ultra pure sample of the isotope uranium 238 electroplated on the record s cover uranium 238 has a half life of 4 51 billion years it is possible that a civilization that encounters the record will be able to use the ratio of remaining uranium to daughter elements to determine the age of the record the records also had the sentence to the makers of music all worlds all times handwritten on them since this was not in the original disc specification it almost caused their rejection voyager 1 was launched in 1977 passed the orbit of pluto in 1990 and left the solar system in november 2004 it is now in empty space in about 40 000 years it and voyager 2 will each come to within about 1 7 light years of two separate stars voyager 1 will have approached star ac 79 3888 located in the constellation ophiuchus and voyager 2 will have approached star ross 248 located in the constellation of andromeda in may 2005 voyager 1 was 14 billion km from the sun and traveling at a speed of 3 5 au per year while voyager 2 is about 10 5 billion km away and moving at about 3 13 au per year voyager 1 has entered the heliosheath the region beyond the termination shock the termination shock is where the solar wind a thin stream of electrically charged gas blowing continuously outward from the sun is slowed by pressure from gas between the stars at the termination shock the solar wind slows abruptly from its average speed of 300 to 700 km per second and becomes denser and hotter as carl sagan has noted the spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilizations in interstellar space but the launching of this bottle into the cosmic ocean says something very hopeful about life on this planet most of the images used on the record together with information about its compilation can be found in the 1978 book murmurs of earth the voyager interstellar record by carl sagan f d drake ann druyan timothy ferris jon lomberg and linda salzman a cd rom version was issued by warner new media in 1992 both versions are out of print but the 1978 edition can be found in many college or public libraries in july 1983 bbc radio 4 broadcast the 45 minute documentary music from a small planet in which sagan and druyan explained the process of selecting music for the record and introduced excerpts it was not clear whether this was an original bbc documentary or an imported npr production a cd rom was released in 1992 by warner new media as a companion to the book murmurs of earth which documented and catalogued the creation and contents of the golden record the cd rom was the result of sagan s diligence in obtaining copyright clearances for many of the numerous musical passages and photographs that the original golden record contained to allow for their inclusion in the warner new media release both the book and the companion cd rom are no longer published although used copies may still be found further information is

lewis allan lou reed is an american rock musician best known as the guitarist vocalist and principal songwriter of the velvet underground as well as a successful solo artist whose career has spanned several decades the band gained little mainstream attention during their career but became one of the most influential of their era as the velvet underground s main songwriter reed analyzed subjects of personal experience that rarely had been examined so openly in rock and roll including a variety of sexual topics and drug culture and use as a guitarist he was a pioneer of many guitar effects including distortion high volume feedback and nonstandard tunings reed began a long and eclectic solo career in 1971 he had a hit the following year with walk on the wild side though for more than a decade he seemed to wilfully evade the mainstream commercial success its chart status offered him one of rock s most volatile personalities reed s work as a solo artist has frustrated critics wishing for a return of the velvet underground the most notable example is 1975 s infamous double lp of recorded feedback loops metal machine music upon which reed later commented no one is supposed to be able to do a thing like that and survive by the late 1980s however he had garnered recognition as an elder statesman of rock lou reed was born into a jewish family in 1942 at beth el hospital in brooklyn and grew up in freeport new york contrary to some sources his birth name was lewis allan reed not louis firbanks he developed an early interest in rock and roll and rhythm and blues and during high school played in a number of bands his first recording was as a member of a doo wop style group called the shades reed received electroconvulsive therapy in his teen years in response to his homosexual behavior in his dark 1974 song kill your sons he revisited the experience in an interview reed said of the experience reed began attending syracuse university where he hosted a late night radio program on waer called excursions on a wobbly rail  which typically featured doo wop rhythm and blues and jazz particularly the free jazz developed in the mid 1950s many of reed s innovative guitar techniques were inspired by jazz saxophonists notably ornette coleman reed graduated from the syracuse college of arts and sciences with a bachelors of the arts degree in june 1964 noted poet delmore schwartz then in the last years of his life taught at syracuse and befriended reed who in 1966 dedicated to schwartz the song european son from the velvet underground s debut album the velvet underground and nico later in 1982 reed recorded my house as a tribute to his late mentor my dedalus to your bloom was such a perfect wit schwartz s influence on the aspiring writer seems to have been through encouragement but reed also credits him for insisting on use of colloquial language in his writing he said later his goals as a writer were to bring the sensitivities of the novel to rock music or to write the great american novel in a record album in 1963 reed moved to new york city and began working as an in house songwriter for pickwick records in 1964 he scored a minor hit with the single the ostrich a parodic novelty song of popular dance songs such as the twist that included lines such as put your head on the floor and have somebody step on it his employers had felt the song had hit record potential and arranged for a band to be assembled around reed to promote the recording the ad hoc group called the primitives included welsh musician john cale who had recently moved to new york to study music and was playing viola in composer la monte young s theater of eternal music along with tony conrad cale and conrad were both surprised to find that for the ostrich reed tuned each string of his guitar to the same note this technique created a drone effect similar to their experimentation in young s avant garde ensemble disappointed with reed s performance cale was nevertheless impressed by reed s early repertoire and a partnership began to evolve reed and cale lived together on the lower east side and adding reed s college acquaintances guitarist sterling morrison and drummer maureen tucker to the group they formed the velvet underground though internally unstable and never achieving significant commercial success the band has a long standing reputation as one of the most influential underground bands in rock history the group caught the attention of notable artist andy warhol who raised their profile immeasurably if not improving their immediate fortunes one of warhol s first contributions to the band s success was securing them a steady spot as the house band at max s kansas city warhol s associates inspired many of reed s songs as he fell into a thriving multifaceted artistic scene reed rarely gives an interview without paying homage to warhol as a mentor figure still conflict emerged when warhol had the idea for the group to take on as chanteuse the european former model nico reed and the others registered their objection by titling their debut album the velvet underground and nico despite his initial resistance reed wrote several songs for nico to sing and the two were briefly lovers at the time this album reached 171 on the charts today however it is considered one of the most influential rock albums ever produced influencing glam rock punk post punk gothic rock shoegazing and more rolling stone has it listed as the 13th best rock album of all time brian eno once famously stated that although few people bought the album most of those who did were inspired to form their own band by the time the band recorded white light white heat nico had quit and warhol was fired both against the wishes of cale warhol s replacement as manager steve sesnick convinced reed to drive cale out of the band morrison and tucker were discomfited by reed s tactics but continued with the group cale s replacement was doug yule whom reed would often facetiously introduce as his younger brother the group now took on a more pop oriented sound and acted more as a vehicle for reed to develop his songwriting craft the group released two more albums with this line up 1969 s the velvet underground and 1970 s loaded the latter included two of the group s most commercially successful songs rock and roll and sweet jane reed left the velvet underground in august 1970 the band disintegrated as core members sterling morrison and maureen tucker departed in august 1971 and early 1972 respectively doug yule continued until early 1973 and released one more studio album squeeze under the velvet underground name after the band s move to atlantic s cotillion label their new manager pushed reed to change the subject matter of his songs to lighter topics in hopes of resulting in more accessible and mainstream music the band s album loaded had taken more time to record than the previous three albums together and was written and produced to be loaded with hits but had not broken the band through to a wider audience reed briefly retired to his parents home on long island after quitting the velvet underground in august 1970 reed took a job at his father s tax accounting firm as a typist by his own account earning 40 a week a year later however he signed a recording contract with rca and recorded his first solo album in london with top session musicians including steve howe and rick wakeman members of the progressive rock group yes the album simply titled lou reed contained smoothly produced re recorded versions of unreleased velvet underground songs some of which were originally recorded by the velvets for loaded but shelved this first solo album was overlooked by most pop music critics and it did not sell in significant numbers in 1972 reed released the glam rock record transformer david bowie and mick ronson co produced the album and introduced reed to a wider popular audience the hit single walk on the wild side was both a salute and swipe at the misfits hustlers and transvestites in andy warhol s factory the song s cleverly transgressive lyrics evaded radio censorship though musically somewhat atypical for reed it eventually became his signature song the song came about as a result of his commission to compose a soundtrack to a theatrical adaptation of nelson algren s novel of the same name though the play failed to materialize ronson s arrangements brought out new aspects of reed s songs perfect day for example features delicate strings and soaring dynamics it was rediscovered in the 1990s and allowed reed to drop walk on the wild side from his concerts though transformer would prove to be reed s commercial and critical pinnacle there was no small amount of resentment in reed devoted to the shadow the record cast over the rest of his career a public argument between bowie and reed ended their working relationship for several years though the subject of the argument is not known the two reconciled some years later and reed performed with bowie at the latter s 50th birthday concert at madison square garden in 1997 the two would not formally collaborate again until 2003 s the raven reed followed transformer with the darker berlin which tells the story of two junkies in love in the city of the same name the songs variously concern domestic abuse drug addiction adultery and prostitution and suicide as he had done with berlin after transformer in 1975 reed responded to his glam rock success with a commercial failure a double album of electronically generated audio feedback metal machine music critics interpreted it as a gesture of contempt an attempt to break his contract with rca or to alienate his less sophisticated fans but reed claimed that the album was a genuine artistic effort even suggesting that quotations of classical music could be found buried in the feedback bangs declared it genius though also as psychologically disturbing the album was reportedly returned to stores by the thousands after a few weeks though later admitting that the liner notes list of instruments is fictitious and intended as parody reed maintains that mmm was and is a serious album in the 2000s it was adapted for orchestral performance by the german ensemble zeitkratzer by contrast 1976 s coney island baby was mainly a warm and mellow album though for its characters reed still drew on the underworld of city life at this time his lover was a transgender woman rachel mentioned in the dedication of coney island baby and appearing in the photos on the cover of reed s 1977 best of album walk on the wild side the best of lou reed while rock and roll heart his 1976 debut for his new record label arista fell short of expectations street hassle was a return to form in the midst of the punk scene he had helped to inspire but ironically reed was dismissive of punk and  disclaimed any identity with punk its idiculous i m too literate to be into punk rock the whole cbgb s new max s thing that everyone s into and what s going on in london you don t seriously think i m responsible for what s mostly rubbish the bells featured jazz great don cherry and was followed by growing up in public with guitarist chuck hammer the following year around this period he also appeared as a sleazy record producer in paul simon s film one trick pony reed also played several unannounced one off concerts in tiny downtown manhattan clubs with the likes of cale patti smith and david byrne during the period but full reconciliation between cale and reed was implausible cale later wrote the song woman about reed on his album blackacetate in 1980 reed married british designer sylvia morales they were divorced more than a decade later while together morales inspired some of reed s strongest love songs particularly think it over from 1980 s growing up in public and women from 1982 s the blue mask after legendary hearts and new sensations fared adequately on the charts reed was sufficiently rehabilitated as a public figure to become spokesman for honda scooters in 1986 he joined the amnesty international a conspiracy of hope tour and was outspoken about new york s political issues and personalities on the 1989 album new york commenting on crime aids jesse jackson kurt waldheim and pope john paul ii reed also took movie roles that echoed aspects of his personality or at least his reputation he played metaphysical folk singer auden in the 1983 allan arkush film get crazy for which he wrote and performed the song little sister reed also provided the singing voice for the character mok in the 1983 film rock rule and wrote the songs my name is mok and triumph for the film s soundtrack following warhol s death after routine surgery in 1987 reed again collaborated with john cale on 1990 s songs for drella the album marked an end to a 22 year estrangement the album took the shape of a warhol biography on the album reed sings of his love for his late friend but also criticizes both the doctors who were unable to save warhol s life and warhol s would be assassin valerie solanas in 1990 following a 20 year hiatus the velvet underground reformed for a cartier benefit in france reed released his sixteenth solo record magic and loss in 1992 an album about mortality inspired by the death of two close friends from cancer in 1993 the velvet underground again reunited and toured throughout europe though plans for a north american tour were cancelled following another falling out between reed and cale in 1994 reed appeared in a celebration the music of pete townshend and the who also known as daltrey sings townshend this was a two night concert at carnegie hall produced by roger daltrey of english rock band the who in celebration of his fiftieth birthday in 1994 a cd and a vhs video were issued and in 1998 a dvd was released reed performed a radically rearranged version of now and then from psychoderelict in 1996 the velvet underground were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame at the induction ceremony reed performed a song entitled last night i said goodbye to my friend alongside former bandmates john cale and maureen tucker in dedication to velvet underground guitarist sterling morrison who had died the previous august reed has since been nominated for the rock hall as a solo artist twice in 2000 and 2001 but has not been inducted in 1997 over 30 artists covered perfect day for the bbc s children in need appeal 1996 s set the twilight reeling received a lukewarm reception but 2000 s ecstasy including several tracks originally written for the time rocker piece drew praise from most critics including robert christgau in 1996 lou reed contributed songs and music to time rocker an avant garde theatrical interpretation of h g wells s the time machine staged by theater director robert wilson the piece premiered in the thalia theater in hamburg germany and was later also shown at the brooklyn academy of music in new york since the late 1990s reed has been romantically linked to the musician multi media and performance artist laurie anderson and the two have collaborated on a number of recordings together anderson contributed to call on me from reed s project the raven to the tracks rouge and rock minuet from reed s ecstasy and to hang on to your emotions from reed s set the twilight reeling reed contributed to in our sleep from anderson s bright red and to one beautiful evening from anderson s life on a string they were married on april 12 2008 in may 2000 reed performed before pope john paul ii at the great jubilee concert in rome in 2000 a new collaboration with robert wilson called poe try was staged at the thalia theater in germany as with the previous collaboration time rocker poe try was also inspired by the works of a 19th century writer edgar allan poe lou became obsessed with poe after producer and long time friend hal willner had suggested him to read some of poe s text at a halloween benefit he was curating at st ann s episcopal church in brooklyn for this new collaboration with robert willson lou reed reworked and even rewrote some of poe s text as well as included some new songs based on the theme explored in the texts in 2001 reed made a cameo appearance in the movie adaptation of prozac nation on october 6 2001 the new york times published a lou reed poem called laurie sadly listening in which he reflects upon the events of 9 11 incorrect reports of reed s death were broadcast by numerous us radio stations in 2001 caused by a hoax email which said he had died of an overdose in 2003 he released a 2 cd set the raven based on poe try besides lou reed and his band the album featured a wide range of actors and musicians including singers david bowie laurie anderson kate mcgarrigle anna mcgarrigle the blind boys of alabama and antony hegarty saxophonist and long time idol ornette coleman and actors elizabeth ashley steve buscemi willem dafoe amanda plummer fisher stevens and kate valk the album consisted of songs written by reed and spoken word performances of reworked and rewritten texts of edgar allan poe by the actors set to electronic music composed by reed at the same time a 1 cd version of the albums focusing on the music was also released a few months after the release of the raven a new 2 cd best of set was released entitled nyc man which featured an unreleased version of the song who am i and a selection of career spanning tracks that had been selected remastered and sequenced under lou s own supervision in april 2003 lou reed embarked on a new world tour supporting both new and released material with a band including celliste jane scarpantoni and singer antony hegarty during some of the concerts for this tour the band was joined by master ren guangyi lou s personal tai chi instructor performing tai chi movements to the music on stage this tour was documented in the 2004 double disc live album animal serenade recorded live at the wiltern in los angeles 2003 also saw the release of lou s first book of photographs called emotions in action this work actually was made up out of 2 books a larger a4 paper sized called emotions and a smaller one called actions which was laid into the hard cover of the former after hours a tribute to the music of lou reed was released by wampus multimedia in 2003 in 2004 a groovefinder remix of his song satellite of love was released it reached 10 in the uk singles chart also in 2004 lou reed contributed vocals and guitar to the track fistful of love on i am a bird now by antony and the johnsons in 2005 reed did a spoken word text on danish rock band kashmir s album no balance palace in january 2006 a second book of photographs called lou reed s new york was released at the 2006 mtv video music awards reed performed white light white heat with the raconteurs later in the night while co presenting the award for best rock video with pink he exclaimed apparently unscripted that mtv should be playing more rock n roll in october 2006 lou reed appeared at hal willner s leonard cohen tribute show came so far for beauty in

 buenos airestango is a style of music that originated among european immigrant populations of argentina and uruguay it is traditionally played by a sextet known as the orquesta típica which includes two violins piano doublebass and two bandoneons earlier forms of this ensemble sometimes included flute clarinet and guitar tango music may be purely instrumental or may include a vocalist tango music is well known across much of the world along with the associated tango dance even though the present forms developed in argentina and uruguay from the mid 20th century there are records of 19th and early 20th century tango styles in cuba and spain while there is a flamenco tangos dance that may share a common ancestor in a minuet style european dance all sources stress the influence of the african communities and their rhythms while the instruments and techniques brought in by european immigrants in the second half of the 20th century played a major role in its final definition relating it to the salon music styles to which tango would contribute back at a later stage the first tango ever recorded was made by angel villoldo and played by the french national guard in paris villoldo had to record in paris because in argentina at the time there was no recording studio early tango was played by immigrants in buenos aires the first generation of tango players was called guardia vieja by the end of the 19th century this blend of salon european and african music was heard throughout metropolitan buenos aires it took time to move into wider circles in the early 20th century it was the favorite music of thugs and gangsters who visited the brothels in a city with 100 000 more men than women the complex dances that arose from this rich music reflects the habit of men to practice tango together in groups expressing both machismo and sexual desire leading to the distinct mix of sensitivity and aggressiveness of the form the music was played on portable instruments flute guitar and violin trios with bandoneón arriving at the end of the 19th century the organito a portable player organ broadened the popularity of certain songs eduardo arolas was the major instrument of the bandoneón s popularization with vicente greco soon standardizing the tango sextet as consisting of piano double bass two violins and two bandoneóns like many forms of popular music the tango was associated with the underclass and the better off argentines tried to restrict its influence in spite of the scorn some like writer ricardo güiraldes were fans güiraldes played a part in the international popularization of the tango which had conquered the world by the end of world war i and wrote a poem which describes the music as the all absorbing love of a tyrant jealously guarding his dominion over women who have surrendered submissively like obedient beasts one song that would become arguably the most widely known of all tango melodies also dates from this time the first two sections of la cumparsita were composed as a march instrumental in 1917 by then 17 year old uruguayan gerardo matos rodríguez tango soon began to gain popularity in europe beginning in france superstar ricardo guiraldes soon became a sex symbol who brought the tango to new audiences especially in the united states due to his sensual depictions of the dance on film in the 1920s tango moved out of the lower class brothels and became a more respectable form of music and dance bandleaders like roberto firpo and francisco canaro dropped the flute and added a double bass in its place lyrics were still typically macho blaming women for countless heartaches and the dance moves were still sexual and aggressive carlos gardel became especially associated with the transition from a lower class gangster music to a respectable middle class dance he helped develop tango canción in the 1920s and became one of the most popular tango artists of all time he was also one of the precursors of the golden age of tango gardel s death was followed by a division into movements within tango evolutionists like aníbal troilo and carlos di sarli were opposed to traditionalists like rodolfo biagi and juan d arienzo the golden age of tango music and dance is generally agreed to have been the period from about 1935 to 1952 roughly contemporaneous with the big band era in the united states some of the many popular and influential orchestras included the orchestras of juan d arienzo francisco canaro and aníbal troilo d arienzo was called the rey del compás or king of the beat for the insistent driving rhythm which can be heard on many of his recordings el flete is an excellent example of d arienzo s approach canaro s early milongas are generally the slowest and easiest to dance to and for that reason they are the most frequently played at tango dances milonga sentimental is a classic example beginning in the golden age and continuing afterwards the orchestras of osvaldo pugliese and carlos di sarli made many recordings di sarli had a lush grandiose sound and emphasized strings and piano over the bandoneon which is heard in a la gran muñeca and bahía blanca pugliese s first recordings were not too different from those of other dance orchestras but he developed a complex rich and sometimes discordant sound which is heard in his signature pieces gallo ciego emancipación and la yumba pugliese s later music was played for an audience and not intended for dancing although it is often used for stage choreography for its dramatic potential and sometimes played late at night at milongas the later age of tango has been dominated by ástor piazzolla whose adiós nonino became the most influential work of tango since carlos gardel s el día que me quieras was released during the 1950s piazzolla consciously tried to create a more academic form with new sounds breaking the classic forms of tango earning the derision of purists and old time performers the 1970s saw buenos aires developing a fusion of jazz and tango litto nebbia and siglo xx were especially popular within this movement an important work of recent years is that of argentine band 020 whose epic album end of illusions mixed british style pop rock with nuevo tango the so called post piazzolla generation includes musicians such as dino saluzzi rodolfo mederos enrique martin entenza and juan maría solare piazzolla and his followers developed nuevo tango which incorporated jazz and classical influences into a more experimental style tango development has not stopped here the following examples are not filed under tango nuevo since such classification is usually done with hindsight rather than when still undergoing development these recent trends can be described as electro tango or tango fusion where the electronic influences are available in multiple ranges from very subtle to rather dominant tanghetto and carlos libedinsky are good examples of the subtle use of electronic elements the music still has its tango feeling the complex rhythmic and melodious entanglement that makes tango so unique gotan project is a group based in paris consisting of musicians philippe cohen solal eduardo makaroff and christoph h muller they formed in 1999 their releases include vuelvo al sur el capitalismo foráneo la revancha del tango inspiración espiración and lunático their sound features electronic elements like samples beats and sounds on top of a tango groove tango dancers around the world enjoy dancing to this music although many more traditional dancers regard it as a definite break in style and tradition still the rhythmic elements in gotan project s music are more complex than in some of the other electro tango songs that were created afterwards bajofondo tango club and its follow on album supervielle are examples with a stronger electro feeling than gotan project bajofondo tango club s beats are more regular more dominant the rhythms are less complex but the tango feeling is still there other examples can be found on the cds tango hybrid tango tangophobia vol 1 tango crash nutango tango fusion club vol 1 by the creator of the milonga called tango fusion club in munich germany felino by the norwegian group electrocutango and electronic tango a various artists cd in 2004 the leading world music label world music network also released an authoritative collection under the title the rough guide to tango nuevo the tango has become part of the repertoire for great classical musicians one of the first classical interpreters to do this cross over was the baritone jorge chaminé with his tangos recording with bandoneonist olivier manoury since then al tango yo yo ma martha argerich daniel barenboim gidon kremer plácido domingo and marcelo alvarez have performed and recorded tangos some classical composers have written tangos such as isaac albéniz in españa erik satie in le tango perpétuel igor stravinsky in histoire du soldat and john cage in perpetual tango many popular songs in the united states have borrowed melodies from tango the earliest published tango el choclo lent its melody to the fifties hit kiss of fire similarly adiós muchachos became i get ideas and strange sensation was based on la cumparsita

these roots in classic rock sanchez also acknowledges an eclectic array of influences including post hardcore group at the drive in and heavy metal pioneers iron maiden contrary to rumors bassist michael todd stated that the band was not influenced by saga and that indeed he had never heard of that group many draw similarities between rush and coheed and cambria but josh eppard stated in an interview that neither he nor the other band members were rush fans or influenced by rush they began listening to rush after their second album influences of punk rock have been cited as well especially the misfits and bad brains dr know of bad brains plays a guitar solo on the track time consumer from second stage turbine blade sanchez and stever s early band toxic parents drew many similarites from jane s addiction and misfits sanchez has stated that the amory wars the story on which coheed and cambria base their lyrics has similarities to other stories especially to the star wars trilogy for example when the character coheed returns home to his wife cambria she says somehow i ve always known a line that princess leia spoke to luke skywalker in return of the jedi the band s style is described as progressive rock by equal vision spin and allmusic but others have described the band as emo the band themselves say they think being described as emo is just a time and place thing despite arguments for or against either genre the band displays elements of both musical styles songs such as a favor house atlantic and three evils have been described as fairly straightforward slices of emo while the likes of in keeping secrets of silent earth 3 and cuts marked in the march of men as well as the 9 47 minutes long hidden track 21 13 display a more prog style approach with complex time signatures some sources cite the band as new prog piero scaruffi states that the band carried out a historical fusion of the progressive rock tradition and the emo core tradition on their debut album likewise the daily cardinal notes that no world for tomorrow demonstrates it is possible to combine intelligence and musicality in genre that often settles for tight jeans and whiny bitching

warhol put sedgwick in the movie she also made a small cameo appearance in another warhol film horse when she entered towards the end of the film although sedgwick s appearances in both films were brief they generated so much interest that warhol decided to create a vehicle in which she would star the first of those films poor little rich girl was originally conceived as part of a series

once at the factory the film featured sedgwick along with rene ricard satirically pretending to be andy warhol it is thought to be either lost or destroyed following her departure from warhol s circle sedgwick began living at the chelsea hotel where she became close to bob dylan dylan s friends eventually convinced sedgwick to sign up with albert grossman dylan s manager sedgwick and dylan s

february 1966 according to paul morrissey sedgwick had said they re going to make a film and i m supposed to star in it with bobby suddenly it was bobby this and bobby that and they realized that she had a crush on him they thought he d been leading her on because just that day andy had heard in his lawyer s office that dylan had been secretly married for a few months he married sara lownds in november 1965 andy couldn t resist asking did you know edie that bob dylan has gotten married she was trembling they realized that she really thought of herself as entering a relationship with dylan that maybe he hadn t been truthful several weeks before the december 29 2006 one week release of the controversial film factory girl described by the village voice review as edie for dummies the weinstein company and the film s producers interviewed sedgwick s older brother jonathan who asserted that she had had an abortion of the child she was carrying by dylan jonathan sedgwick a retired aeroplane designer was flown in from idaho to new york city by the distributor to meet the starlet sienna miller playing his late sister as well as to give an eight hour video interview with details about the purported liaison between edie and dylan which the distributor promptly released to the news media jonathan claims an abortion took place soon after edie was badly hurt in a motorcycle crash and sent to an emergency unit as a result of the accident doctors consigned her to a mental hospital where she was treated for drug addiction no hospital records or sedgwick family records exist to support this story nonetheless edie s brother also claimed staff found she was pregnant but fearing the baby had been damaged by her drug use and anorexia forced her to have the abortion however according to edie sedgwick s personal medical records and oral life history tape recorded less than a year before her death for her final film ciao manhattan there is credible evidence that the only abortion she underwent in her lifetime was at age 20 in 1963 throughout most of 1966 sedgwick was involved in an intensely private yet tumultuous relationship not with bob dylan but with dylan s closest friend bob neuwirth during this period she became increasingly dependent on barbiturates although she experimented with illegal substances including opiates there is no evidence that sedgwick

care of dr wells who prescribed her barbiturates but she would demand more pills or say she had lost them in order to get more sedgwick often combined the medications with alcohol on the night of

the beggars of london and he endeavours to have macheath hanged his attempts are hindered by the fact that the chief of police tiger brown is macheath s childhood friend still peachum exerts his influence and eventually gets macheath arrested and sentenced to hang macheath escapes this fate via a deus ex machina moments before the execution when in an unrestrained parody of a happy ending a messenger from the queen arrives to pardon macheath and grant him the title of baron the threepenny opera is a work of epic theatre captions are projected on the back wall and the characters sometimes carry picket signs it challenges conventional notions of property as well as those of theatre it dramatises the question who is the greater criminal he who robs a bank or he who founds one the threepenny opera is also an early example of the modern musical comedy genre its score is deeply influenced by jazz and mandates a fifteen piece jazz combo its opening and closing lament the ballad of mackie messer was written just before the berlin premiere when actor harald paulsen threatened to quit if his character did not receive an introduction this creative emergency resulted in what would become the work s most popular song later translated into english by marc blitzstein as mack the knife and now a jazz standard that louis armstrong bobby darin ella fitzgerald frank sinatra michael bublé and countless others have all covered another song pirate jenny which originates from the first act has been famously covered by singer and activist nina simone on 1964 s nina simone in concert she gave the song a grim civil rights undertone with the ship the black freighter symbolizing the coming black revolution the threepenny opera was first performed at the theater am schiffbauerdamm in berlin in 1928 despite an initially poor reception it became a great success playing 400 times in the next two years the performance was a springboard for one of the best known interpreters of brecht and weill s work lotte lenya who was married to weill it has been translated into 18 languages and performed more than 10 000 times in french it was rendered as l opéra de quat sous georg wilhelm

the shop of jonathan jeremiah peachum the boss of london s beggars who outfits and trains the beggars in return for a slice of their takings from begging in the first scene the extent of peachum s iniquity is immediately exposed filch a new beggar is obliged to bribe his way into the profession and agree to pay over to peachum 50 percent of whatever he made the previous day he had been severely beaten up for begging up within the area of jurisdiction of peachum s protection racket as a depiction of capitalist exploitation in a world where even beggars individuals at the most exposed and lowest of human ebbs are constrained to pay protection it sets out to paint an unflattering picture after finishing with the new man peachum becomes aware that his grown daughter polly did not return home the previous night peachum who sees his daughter as his own private property concludes that she has become involved with macheath this does not suit peachum at all and he becomes determined to thwart this relationship and destroy macheath the scene shifts to an empty stable where macheath himself is preparing to marry polly once his gang has stolen and brought all the necessary food and furnishings no vows are exchanged but polly is satisfied and everyone sits down to a banquet since none of the gang members can provide fitting entertainment polly gets up and sings seeräuberjenny a revenge fantasy in which she is a pirate queen and orders the execution of her bosses and customers the gang becomes nervous when the chief of police tiger brown arrives but it s all part of the act

scene polly returns home and defiantly announces that she has married macheath by singing the barbarasong she stands fast against her parents anger but she inadvertently reveals brown s connections to macheath which they subsequently use to their advantage polly warns macheath that her father will try to have him arrested he is finally persuaded that peachum has enough influence to do it and makes arrangements to leave london explaining the details of his bandit business to polly so she can manage it in his absence before he leaves town he stops at his favorite brothel where he sees his ex lover jenny they sing the zuhälterballade about their days together but macheath doesn t know mrs peachum has bribed jenny to turn him in despite brown s apologies there s nothing he can do and macheath is dragged away to jail after he sings the ballade vom angenehmen leben another girlfriend lucy and polly show up at the same time setting the stage for a nasty argument that builds to the eifersuchtsduett after polly leaves lucy engineers macheath s escape when mr peachum finds out he confronts brown and threatens him telling him that he will unleash all of his beggars during queen victoria s coronation parade ruining the ceremony and costing brown his job jenny comes to the peachums shop to demand her money for the betrayal of macheath which mrs peachum refuses to pay jenny reveals that macheath is at suky tawdry s house when brown arrives determined to arrest peachum and the beggars he is horrified to learn that the beggars are already in position and only mr peachum can stop them to placate peachum brown s only option is to arrest macheath and have him executed in the next scene macheath is back in jail and desperately trying to raise a sufficient bribe to get out again even as the gallows are being assembled soon it becomes clear that neither polly nor the gang members can or are willing to raise any money and macheath prepares to die then a sudden reversal a messenger on horseback arrives to announce that macheath has been pardoned by the queen and granted a title a castle and a pension the cast then sings the finale which ends with a plea that

rocksteady is a music genre that was most popular in jamaica starting around 1966 and its reggae successor was established around 1968 the term rocksteady comes from a dance style that was mentioned in the alton ellis song rock steady a successor to jamaican ska and a precursor to reggae rocksteady was performed by jamaican vocal harmony groups such as the gaylads the kingstonians the maytals and the paragons dances performed to rocksteady were less energetic than the earlier ska dance moves rocksteady differs from ska musically as the tempo is slower and more relaxed the bass is heavier and more prominent in the mix and in addition the bass lines abandon the earlier walking style of the ska period in favor of more broken syncopated figures the ska style back beat and the emphasis on the offbeat carried over into rocksteady rocksteady arose at a time when young people from the jamaican countryside were flooding into the urban ghettos of kingston in neighborhoods such as riverton city greenwich town and trenchtown though much of the country was optimistic in the immediate post independence climate these poverty stricken youths did not share this sentiment many of them became delinquents who exuded a certain coolness and style these unruly youths became known as rude boys the rude boy phenomenon had existed in the ska period but was expressed more obviously during the rocksteady era in songs such as rude boy gone a jail by the clarendonians no good rudie by justin hinds the dominoes and don t be a rude boy by the rulers though alton ellis is sometimes said to be the father of rocksteady for his hit girl i ve got a date other candidates for the first rocksteady single include take it easy by hopeton lewis tougher than tough by derrick morgan and hold them by roy shirley in a jamaican radio interview pianist gladstone anderson said that bandleader lynn taitt was the man who slowed down the ska beat in 1964 during a take it easy recording session to create rocksteady the record producer duke reid released alton ellis girl i ve got a date on his treasure isle label as well as recordings by the techniques the silvertones the jamaicans and the paragons reid s work with these groups helped establish the vocal sound of rocksteady notable solo artists include delroy wilson bob andy ken boothe and phyllis dillon rocksteady lyrics mainly dealt with love and the rude boy culture but most of the songs are simply music for dancing rocksteady singers regularly covered american soul recordings for example the song you don t care by the techniques is a cover of you ll want me back by the impressions ilya kuryakin by ike bennet and the crystalites is lifted from theme from a summer place musicians who were crucial in creating the music included guitarist lynn taitt keyboard player jackie mittoo drummer winston grennan bassist jackie jackson and saxophonist tommy mccook as a musical style rocksteady was shortlived and existed only for about two years for this reason original recordings in this genre are often harder to find than those from the ska and reggae era in contrast to rocksteady the jamaican ska trend lasted several years and classic reggae lasted for over a decade several factors contributed to the evolution of rocksteady into reggae in the late 1960s the emigration to canada of key musical arrangers jackie mittoo and lynn taitt and the upgrading of jamaican studio technology had a marked effect on the sound and style of the recordings musically bass patterns became more complex and increasingly dominated the arrangements and the piano gave way to the electric organ in the mix other developments included horns fading farther into the background a scratchier more percussive rhythm guitar the addition of african style hand drumming and a more precise and intricate drumming style the use of a vocal free or lead instrument free dub or b side version became popular in jamaica by the late 1960s as the rastafari movement gained in popularity many reggae songs became focused less on romance and more on black consciousness politics and protest the release of the film the harder they come and the rise of jamaican superstar bob marley brought reggae music to an international level that rocksteady had never been able to reach although rocksteady was a short lived phase of jamaican popular music it was hugely influential to the reggae dub and dancehall styles that followed many bass lines originally created for rocksteady songs continue to be used in contemporary jamaican music 
sea shanties were shipboard working songs some speculate that shanties may have been sung as early as the 15th century though there is little evidence to support this claim the shanties that survived to be collected and preserved date from the 19th century through the days of steam ships in the first half of the 20th century in the days when human muscles were the only power source available aboard ship sea shanties served a practical purpose the rhythm of the song served to synchronize the movements of the sailors as they toiled at repetitive tasks they also served a social purpose singing and listening to songs is pleasant it alleviates boredom and lightens the burden of hard work of which there was no shortage on long voyages in those days most shanties are call and response songs with one voice singing the line and the chorus of sailors bellowing the response for example the shanty boney working it as a short drag or sheet chantey hands on the line would synchronize their pulls with the last syllable of each response musically shanties seem to reflect a variety of sources spanish ladies is a perfect galliard songs like fire marengo look like west african work songs others are adapted folk songs or 19th century polkas and waltzes lyrically like the blues shanties often exhibit a string of stock verses without much explicit continuous theme shanties may be divided into several rough categories the above categories are not absolute sailors could take a song from one category and with necessary alterations to the rhythm use it for a different task the only rule almost always followed was that songs that spoke of returning home were only sung on the homeward leg and songs that sang of the joys of voyaging etc were only sung on the outward leg other songs were very specific poor old man was sung once the sailors had worked off their advance a month or so into the voyage leave her johnny leave her was only sung during the last round of pumping the ship dry once it was tied up in port prior to leaving the ship at the end of the voyage the shantyman was a sailor who led the others in singing he was usually self appointed a sailor would not generally sign on as a shantyman per se but took on the role in addition to their other tasks on the ship nevertheless sailors reputed to be good shantymen were valuable and respected historically shanties were usually not sung ashore today they are performed as popular music shanty choirs often large choral groups that perform only sea shanties are popular in europe particularly poland and the netherlands but also countries such as germany and norway in english speaking countries sea shanties are comparatively less popular as a separate genre and tend to be performed by smaller groups as folk music rather than in a choral style they are also sung by some folk music clubs as a social pastime not for performance a medley of sea shanties performed by classical orchestra sir henry wood s fantasia on british sea songs is a popular component of the last night of the proms in britain in a completely different style frigging in the rigging was recorded by the sex pistols although the days of the tall ships are over the shanty song style is still used for new musical compositions well known examples include the stan rogers song barrett s privateers the steve goodman song lincoln park pirates and the theme song for the television show spongebob squarepants even the song reise reise by the neue deutsche härte band rammstein is based on a shanty reise reise the mariner s revenge song by the decemberists is also said to be in a sea shanty style i soon got used to this singing for the sailors never touched a rope without it sometimes when no one happened to strike up and the pulling whatever it might be did not seem to be getting forward very well the mate would always say come men can t any of you sing sing now and raise the dead and then some one of them would begin and if every man s arms were as much relieved as mine by the song and he could pull as much better as i did with such a cheering accompaniment i am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it it is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing well for he gets a great name by it from the officers and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates some sea captains before shipping a man always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope a song is as necessary to sailors as the drum and fife to a soldier they must pull together as soldiers must step in time and they can t pull in time or pull with a will without it many a time when a thing goes heavy with one fellow yo ho ing a lively song like heave to the girls nancy o jack crosstree cheerly men c has put life and strength into every arm we found a great difference in the effect of the various songs in driving in the hides two or three songs would be tried one after the other with no effect not an inch could be got upon the tackles when a new song struck up seemed to hit the humor of the moment and drove the tackles two blocks at once heave round hearty captain gone ashore dandy ship and a dandy crew and the like might do for common pulls but on an emergency when we wanted a heavy raise the dead pull which should start the beams of the ship there was nothing like time for us to go round the corner tally high ho you know or hurrah hurrah my hearty bullies there is some suggestion that the provençal song by the comtessa de dia titled a chantar m er may be a title pun on the french for a sea shanty the troubadour punning text suggests piracy is afoot fifteen men on the dead man s chest is the first verse of the chorus of a fictional sea shanty from robert louis stevenson s novel treasure island both stan hugill and frank shay have written extensively on sea shanties sea shanties in general annual sea music festivals 
the overwhelming majority of records manufactured have been of certain sizes playback speeds and appearance however since the commercial adoption of the gramophone record a wide variety of records have also been produced that do not fall into these categories and they have served a variety of purposes 7 33⅓ flexi disc records were seen occasionally one common use was as inserts in books that included audio supplements lp recordings could be made on very thin flexible sheets of vinyl and this was sometimes done for a mixture of practical utility and novelty appeal at least one magazine was published with a spiral binding a hole punched through the entire magazine and four or five of these flexible recordings bound into the magazine the magazine could be opened to one of these recordings and turned back upon itself then the entire magazine placed on a turntable and the record could be played in the early days of personal computers when programs were commonly stored on audio cassettes at least one computer magazine published floppy roms which were bound in thin plastic 33⅓ rpm audio recordings of computer data to be played on a turntable and dubbed onto an audio cassette flexi discs or soundsheets often were provided by music publishers to their customers frequently school band and orchestra directors marching band and drum corps leaders and others with their printed catalogs of sheet music the director could then hear a sample recording of the piece as they looked at an excerpt from the musical score paper records were pioneered in the 1930s by hit of the week records and durium records laminated cardboard records have also been produced as promotional materials most notably on the backs of cereal boxes in the late 1960s chocolate has even been used to produce promotional recordings that could be eaten once the record had been played although the lifetime of the records would have been remarkably low perhaps two to three plays 8 rpm 7 inch this recording format was developed sponsored by the american foundation for the blind one record holds 4 hours of speech the format was later used to distribute magazines on ten inch flexible discs recorded at 8⅓ rpm these discs were made of thin plastic and were literally flexible similar to an overhead transparency sheet the first magazine to be circulated widely in the flexible disc format to blind individuals was u s news world report the national library service for the blind ceased using analog discs as a format for audio book and magazine distribution in 2001 16 2 3 rpm this speed was used almost exclusively for spoken word content in particular for the talking books used by the visually impaired for this reason the inclusion of a 16 2 3 speed setting on turntables was compulsory in some countries for many years despite the records themselves being a rarity cassette tapes proved to be a far more popular format for such spoken content chrysler s short lived highway hi fi format also used 16 2 3 7 s prior to 1930 a number of proprietary formats existed with recordings made at speeds anywhere from 60 to 130 rpm even 78 rpm was not initially a worldwide standard as american records were recorded at 78 26 rpm and european records were recorded at 77 92 rpm a small number of 78 rpm microgroove vinyl recordings have been issued by smaller and underground performers mainly as novelty items from the 1970s to the present recently the belfast singer duke special has released a number of ten inch eps in 78 rpm the dutch company philips introduced a constant linear velocity format prior to the standardised 78 where the rpm changed as the stylus traversed the record from the inside to the outside the actual playing speed was shown as a letter between a and d the vast majority of records used a standard small spindle hole the main exception to this is the larger holes on 7 records this was partly due to rca s wishing their system to be incompatible with columbia records system when microgroove vinyl discs were first introduced the larger hole was also designed to be played on jukeboxes which mechanically place the record onto a turntable with a conical spindle of matching size at the base which is easier for a machine than it would be if standard sized holes and spindles were used most 7 records in the usa continue to be pressed with a large hole in other territories such as europe 7 records intended for home use have standard sized holes many such 7 records had a center which could be easily snapped out yielding a record with a larger hole to be used in jukeboxes or certain record stacking players this approach was common in the united kingdom from the 1950s until the early 1980s with standard solid centres becoming gradually more common many blank acetate discs have multiple holes intended to prevent slippage during cutting in 1972 as a factory prank initial copies of a linda jones record were manufactured with no center hole non s pagan muzak is a one sided 7 with multiple locked grooves and two center holes meaning each locked groove can be played at two different trajectories as well as any number of speeds the original release came with instructions for the listener to drill more holes in the record as they saw appropriate nearly all records have a lock groove it is the silent loop at the end of the side which keeps the needle and tonearm from drifting into the label area however it is possible to record sound in this groove and many artists have included looping audio in the locked groove probably the first track to utilize this technique was the beatles sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band featuring a multi layered collage of randomized chatter in its run off loop the who responded by putting a mock advertisement for their label track records in their the who sell out lp on the format s album dog problems the feedback at the end of if work permits continues into the lock groove which repeats another example of locked groove record is godspeed you black emperor s debut album f a  at the end of the song bleak uncertain beautiful  there is a string phrase recorded on the locked groove the title s infinity refers to this phrase the stereolab album transient random noise bursts with announcements ends with the song lock groove lullaby which as the name suggests extends into the locked groove this concept has been extended to the production of records consisting entirely of circular locked grooves to provide collections of infinite loop sound samples of duration limited to one revolution of the disc notable examples of this are the releases from rrrecords of the 7 rrr 100 and the 12 rrr 500 canada s legion of green men took the art further creating several records and remixes containing what they called eternal opuscules rhythmic tunes and songs which would play seamlessly to a locked groove at the end of a side there are also many techno records featuring loops as locked grooves which when recorded at 133⅓ bpm and are replayed at 33⅓ rpm will continuously repeat the beats and musical phrases which can then be utilized by a dj it is possible to master recordings with two or more separate interlaced spiral grooves on a side such records have occasionally been made as novelties depending on where the needle is dropped in the lead in area it will catch more or less randomly in one of the grooves each groove can contain a different recording so that you have a record which magically plays one of several different recordings an example is monty python s matching tie and handkerchief also tool s 1992 ep release opiate featured on the second side a double groove that would either play the first track of side two or the hidden song that was found at the end of the cd version in 2005 a 7 single titled the road leads where it s led by the secret machines was released in uk that contained both tracks on one side on parallel grooves the summer 1980 issue of mad magazine super special included a one sided sound sheet playable on a standard turntable it had eight interlaced grooves each track having the same introduction song but a different ending many of the shins 7 records have parallel grooves on the b side the band none of your fucking business released a one sided 7 called escapes from hell with 2 grooves that started from the center and ended on the outside of the disc one groove ran at 45rpm while the other ran at 33rpm uk punk rocker johnny moped s debut album cycledelic has a lead track with a parallel groove listed on the label as 0 mystery track which runs parallel to the track the 12 single for rap group de la soul s 1989 song me myself and i on the b side it has 2 different tracks in a parallel groove one groove has two remixes of the me myself and i song from the a side while the other has brain washed follower in 1975 ronco uk released a parallel groove game called they re off which featured three 12 discs each containing eight possible outcomes on a horse race it featured noel whitcomb a well known horse racing commentator of the day and the game revolved around betting which horse would win the race on that occasion this appears to have been based on a canadian product called they re at the post by maas marketing which is more or less the same game with different recordings on the discs to reflect the target market almost all analog disc recordings were recorded at constant angular speed resulting in a decreasing linear speed toward the disc center the result was increased end groove distortion toward the center of the disc particularly on loud passages since classical music tends to start quietly and mount to a loud climax it was frequently suggested that it would be better if recordings were made to play from the center of the disk outward a few such recordings were made but the domination of record changers and the fact that symphony movements are not uniformly twenty minutes long made these recordings no more than curiosities in the late 1920s and early 1930s some movie studios experimented with records as an alternative method for recording film sound most of these records played from the inside out as this supposedly made it easier to synchronize the sound on the record with the pictures on the film nevertheless synchronization difficulties meant that sound on film techniques were more commercially successful despite inferior sound quality until the 1920s french pathé records used inside start and other commercially distinctive grooving at that time they cut all discs vertically meaning the vibrations in the grooves were hill and dale as their wax cylinders had always been the records required a special sapphire stylus and a vertically responsive reproducer for playback inventor thomas edison who always favored the cylinder for all its advantages also cut his discs with vertically modulated grooves from their introduction in 1912 until a year or two before his company s demise in 1929 edison pioneered fine groove discs that played for up to five minutes per 10 inch side they were very thick to remain perfectly flat and played back with a precision ground diamond stylus a commercially unsuccessful extension of the system introduced grooves nearly twice as fine as those of microgroove lps yielding playing times of up to 20 minutes per side at 80 rpm and again requiring a special diamond stylus even more than with pathé discs edison s vertical cut records called for specially designed equipment for playback to play these or other vertical cut recordings on modern equipment one must reconnect a stereo pick up cartridge such that it picks up a cross phased signal and switch the sound output to mono as late as 1977 mercury records released a dealer only promotional lp called counter revolutions which played from the inside out and had a locking groove at the disc s edge even later in 1985 memory records in germany released a limited edition version of the italo disco hit talking to the night by brian ice that played from the edge of the label outwards in 1993 american metal band megadeth released a single sweating bullets on 12 blue vinyl with both sides running from the inside of the disk outwards before the development of the single groove stereo system circa 1957 at least one company cook laboratories released a number of binaural recordings these were not created using binaural recording techniques but rather each side of one of these recordings consisted of two long continuous tracks one containing the left channel and the other containing the right channel it was intended that the buyer purchase an adapter from cook laboratories that allowed two cartridges to be mounted together with the proper spacing on a single tone arm only a very small number of recordings were ever released in this format quadraphonic records present four channels of audio requiring specialized pickups or decoding equipment to reproduce the two additional channels signals from the groove highway hi fi was a system of proprietary records and players designed for use in automobiles utilizing a slower play speed and high stylus pressure unusual colors and even multi colored shellac first appeared in the 1910s on such labels as vocalion recordswhen rca victor launched the 7 45 rpm record they initially had eight musical classifications each with not only its own uniquely colored label but with a corresponding color vinyl according to experts at the sarnoff center in princeton nj the cost of maintaining eight vinyl colors became too high but the different colored labels were continued at least for popular music and classical in october 1945 rca victor put on the market its first non breakable phonograph records made of a ruby red translucent vinyl resin plastic they cost twice as much as the 12 inch victor red seal in the 1960s a distinction was made in label colors of promotional copies of 45 rpm records as well with pop music being issued on yellow labels and country on light green red raven released 78 rpm children s records with an animation printed onto the disc they included a little mirrored device to pop onto the turntable s spindle that reflected the animation in such a way that while the record plays one gets to see a little cartoon in the 1970s such gimmicks started to reappear on records especially on 7 and 12 singles these included using colored acetate instead of black vinyl the whole spectrum was available from clear transparent white red blue yellow and even multi hued some recordings were released in several different colors in an effort to sell the same product to one person multiple times if they were of the collecting bent currently it is common practice for hardcore punk to release records of different colors at the same time and press a smaller number of one color than the other this has created a culture of hardcore record collecting based around having the same release multiple times each copy with a different and more rare color in 1972 the kingdom of bhutan released several unusual postage stamps that were playable plastic phonograph records these miniature 33 1 3 rpm recordings feature either regional music or tourism information while they are sought after as novelty postage stamps they were not practical for postage use because of their size and cancellation damaged the grooves rendering them unplayable also the small circumference of many of the stamps made them unplayable on turntables with automatic return tonearms the 1977 release of the 45rpm single of strawberry letter 23 by the brothers johnson was produced by a m records with a slightly pink center label and had strawberry scent embedded into the plastic to make the record give off the odor of strawberries kraftwerk released a 12 single of neon lights made of glow in the dark plastic penetration released a luminous vinyl limited edition of the album moving targets in 1978 and the translumadefractadisc punk sampler picture disc was released by the label in 1979 the foo fighter s debut single this is a call was available on 12 glow in the dark vinyl and luke vibert also released a glow in the dark 11 ep in 2000 the canadian pressing of devo s q are we not men a we are devo album featured spattered color vinyl with a grey white marbled base with splashes of color on the top of that the us pressing came in multiple colors of vinyl while the uk pressing was a picture disc and came with a flexi disc isis released their first ep red sea on tri coloured vinyl divided like a pie one third was red one third was black and one third was tan gold other bands have released records with 2 colours divided down the middle picture discs debuted in the early 1930s when various materials were used experimentally as gimmicks or for advertising these early picture discs were simply a sheet of thin vinyl film which was placed over a thick paper print and then pressed with the grooves and had very poor sound quality adolf hitler even released a 7 picture disc of this type with one of his speeches known as the patria picture disc the obverse bears an image of hitler giving a speech and has a recording of both a speech by hitler and also party member hans hinkel the reverse bears a hand holding a swastika flag and the carl woitschach recording in dem kampf um die heimat faschistenmarsch invented in the forties by tom saffady vogue records were manufactured in detroit michigan at sav way industries during 1946 and 1947 and sold for 50 to 75 cents each with 74 titles featuring artists like lulu belle the charlie shavers quintet and patsy montana they were 10 in diameter and made of an aluminum platter covered in vinyl following introduction of colored vinyl picture discs started to appear in the 1970s the first serious pictures discs were developed by metronome records gmbh these new picture discs were made by creating a five layer lamination consisting of a core of black vinyl with kiln dried paper decals on either side and then outer skins of clear vinyl film on the outsides in manufacture one layer of the clear film was first placed on the bed of the press on top of the stamper then a puck of hot black vinyl from the extruder was placed on top of that finally the top print and vinyl film layer was added and the press closed problems with poor vinyl flow caused by the paper texture and air released from the paper plagued the process one of the first rock picture discs was british progressive rock band curved air s first album air conditioning on some picture discs the images used were meant to create an optical illusion while the record was rotating on the turntable while others used the visual effect to add to the music  for example the 1979 picture disc of fischer z s the worker featured a train which endlessly commuted around the turntable reinforcing the song s message later picture discs included liquid light show style fluids between the vinyl rowlux 3d effect film defraction rainbow film metal flake pressure sensitive liquid crystals that changed color when the record was picked up a real holographic record and even a real live album made as a demonstration for stevie wonder s journey through the secret life of plants it featured a layer of blotting paper between the clear vinyl layers that contained alfalfa seeds a tag of the blotting paper protruded below the record and resting the disc on a glass of water with the paper in the water allowed the seeds to germinate and grow inside the record when the prototype was taken through customs in canada it was seized by the department of agriculture making it not only the only real live album but the only record ever banned by the department of agriculture shaped discs contain an ordinary grooved centre but with a non grooved outer rim that can be cut to any shape that does not cut into the grooves these oddly shaped records were frequently combined with picture discs a trend that was pushed particularly hard by uk record company branches in the mid 1980s curiously uncut test pressings of shaped discs in their original 12 form with the clear vinyl surrounds still intact are much more sought after by collectors than the regular shapes themselves some extreme examples required smaller grooving than standard 7 such as the single montana by john linnell which was in the shape of the usa this record was problematic because record players whose tonearms returned automatically after the record finished playing often did just that before the needle actually reached the song usually taking up a blank side of vinyl rather than containing music one side of a disc can be pressed with etched or embossed images this can take the from of autographs part of the artwork or logos coheed and cambria released their fourth album good apollo i m burning star iv volume two no world for tomorrow with side iv having etched artwork on it incorporating the band s logo the b side of dinosaur jr s cover of the cure s just like heaven has a bas relief sculpture embossed on its surface although these etchings cannot be seen while the record is playing some are pressed on clear vinyl so the etchings can be seen from both sides an example of this is the 1997 7 of freeze the atlantic by cable which has etched fish the japanese rock band boris pressed their 2006 album vein on transparent vinyl with etched artwork on the outer two inches of the record this causes problems with auto start phonographs as the actual grooves of music do not start where the needle is designed to drop this can cause damage to the needle and record artwork the 1980 a m records lp of split enz s album true colours was remarkable not only for its multiple cover releases but for the laser etching process used on the vinyl the logo from the album cover as well as other shapes were etched into the vinyl in a manner that if hit by a light would reflect in polychromatic colors this laser etching does not affect the playing grooves this same process was also used for the 45 single of the band s song one step ahead from the album waiata 
in western music harmony is the use of different pitches simultaneously and chords actual or implied in music the word is related to the word harmonic which implies related wavelengths of waves the study of harmony may often refer to the study of harmonic progressions the movement from one pitch simultaneously to another and the structural principles that govern such progressions in western music harmony often refers to the vertical aspects of music distinguished from ideas of melodic line or the horizontal aspect for this reason considerations of counterpoint or polyphony are often distinguished from those of harmony though contrapuntal writing of the common practice period of western music is conceived and defined in terms of underlying harmonic motion the term harmony derives from the greek ἁρμονία meaning joint agreement concord and that from the verb ἁρμόζω to fit together to join in ancient greek music the term was used to define the combination of contrasted elements a higher and lower note nevertheless the simultaneous sounding of notes was not part of musical practice in antiquity harmonía merely provided a system of classification for the relationships between different pitches in the middle ages the term was used to describe two pitches sounding in combination and in the renaissance the concept was expanded to denote three pitches sounding together it was not until the publication of rameau s traité de l harmonie in 1722 that any text discussing musical practice made use of the term in the title the work is however by no means considered the earliest record of theoretical discussion of the topic this and similar texts tend to survey and codify the musical relationships that were closely linked to the evolution of tonality from the renaissance to the late romanic periods the underlying principle behind these texts is the notion that harmony sanctions harmoniousness by conforming to certain pre established compositional principles current dictionary definitions while attempting to give concise descriptions often highlight the ambiguity of the term in modern use such ambiguities tend to arise from either aesthetic considerations or from the point of view of musical texture in the words of arnold whitall while the entire history of music theory appears to depend on just such a distinction between harmony and counterpoint it is no less evident that developments in the nature of musical composition down the centuries have presumed the interdependence at times amounting to integration at other times a source of sustained tension between the vertical and horizontal dimensions of musical space the view that modern tonal harmony in western music began in about 1600 is commonplace in music theory this is usually accounted for by the replacement of horizontal writing common in the music of the renaissance with a new emphasis on the vertical element of composed music modern theorists however tend to see this as an unsatisfactory generalisation as carl dahlhaus puts it it was not that counterpoint was supplanted by harmony but that an older type both of counterpoint and of vertical technique was succeeded by a newer type and harmony comprises not only the structure of chords but also their movement like music as a whole harmony is a process descriptions and definitions of harmony and harmonic practice may show bias towards european musical traditions for example south asian art music is frequently cited as placing little emphasis on what is perceived in western practice as conventional harmony the underlying harmonic foundation for most south asian music is the drone a held open fifth that does not alter in pitch throughout the course of a composition pitch simultaneity in particular is rarely a major consideration nevertheless many other considerations of pitch are relevant to the music its theory and its structure such as the complex system of rāgas which combines both melodic and modal considerations and codifications within it so although intricate combinations of pitches sounding simultaneously in indian classical music do occur they are rarely studied as teleological harmonic or contrapuntal progressions which is the case with notated western music this contrasting emphasis manifests itself to some extent in the different methods of performance adopted in indian music improvisation takes a major role in the structural framework of a piece whereas in western music improvisation has been uncommon since the end of the 19th century where it does occur in western music the improvisation will either embellish pre notated music or if not draw from musical models that have previously been established in notated compositions and therefore employ familiar harmonic schemes there is no doubt nevertheless that the emphasis on the precomposed in european art music and the written theory surrounding it shows considerable cultural bias the grove dictionary of music and musicians identifies this quite clearly in western culture the musics that are most dependent on improvisation such as jazz have traditionally been regarded as inferior to art music in which pre composition is considered paramount the conception of musics that live in oral traditions as something composed with the use of improvisatory techniques separates them from the higher standing works that use notation yet the evolution of harmonic practice and language itself in western art music is and was facilitated by this process of prior composition remained unchanged regardless of the nature of the performance some traditions of music performance composition and theory have specific rules of harmony these rules are often held to be based on natural properties such as pythagorean tuning s law whole number ratios or harmonics and resonances with the allowable pitches and harmonies gaining their beauty or simplicity from their closeness to those properties while pythagorean ratios can provide a rough approximation of perceptual harmonicity they cannot account for cultural factors early western religious music often features parallel perfect intervals these intervals would preserve the clarity of the original plainsong these works were created and performed in cathedrals and made use of the resonant modes of their respective cathedrals to create harmonies as polyphony developed however the use of parallel intervals was slowly replaced by the english style of consonance that used thirds and sixths the english style was considered to have a sweeter sound and was better suited to polyphony in that it offered greater linear flexibility in part writing early music also forbade usage of the tritone as its dissonance was associated with the devil and composers often went to considerable lengths via musica ficta to avoid using it in the newer triadic harmonic system however the tritone became permissible as the standardization of functional dissonance made its use in dominant chords desirable although most harmony comes about as a result of two or more notes being sounded simultaneously it is possible to strongly imply harmony with only one melodic line through the use of arpeggios or hocket many pieces from the baroque period for solo string instruments such as bach s sonatas and partitas for solo violin convey subtle harmony through inference rather than full chordal structures see below carl dahlhaus distinguishes between coordinate and subordinate harmony subordinate harmony is the hierarchical tonality or tonal harmony well known today while coordinate harmony is the older medieval and renaissance tonalité ancienne the term is meant to signify that sonorities are linked one after the other without giving rise to the impression of a goal directed development a first chord forms a progression with a second chord and a second with a third but the former chord progression is independent of the later one and vice versa coordinate harmony follows direct relationships rather than indirect as in subordinate interval cycles create symmetrical harmonies such as frequently in the music of alban berg george perle arnold schoenberg béla bartók and edgard varèse s density 21 5 other types of harmony are based upon the intervals used in constructing the chords used in that harmony most chords used in western music are based on tertial harmony or chords built with the interval of thirds in the chord c major7 c e is a major third e g is a minor third and g to b is a major third other types of harmony consist of quartal harmony and quintal harmony an interval is the relationship between two separate musical pitches for example in the melody twinkle twinkle little star the first two notes and the second two notes are at the interval of one fifth what this means is that if the first two notes were the pitch c the second two notes would be the pitch g four scale notes or seven chromatic notes above it the following are common intervals therefore the combination of notes with their specific intervals a chord creates harmony for example in a c chord there are three notes c e and g the note c is the root tone with the notes e and g providing harmony in the musical scale there are twelve pitches each pitch is referred to as a degree of the scale in actuality there are no names for each degree there is no real c or e flat or a nature did not name the pitches the only inherent quality that these degrees have is their harmonic relationship to each other the names a b c d e f and g are insignificant the intervals however are not here is an example as you can see there no note always corresponds to a certain degree of the scale the root or 1st degree note can be any of the 12 notes of the scale all the other notes fall into place so when c is the root note the fourth degree is f but when d is the root note the fourth degree is g so while the note names are intransigent the intervals are not in layman s terms a fourth is always a fourth no matter what the root note is the great power of this fact is that any song can be played or sung in any key it will be the same song as long as the intervals are kept the same when the intervals surpass the octave these intervals are named as extended intervals which include particularly the 9th 11th and 13th intervals widely used in jazz and blues music extended intervals are formed and named as following apart from this categorization intervals can also be divided into consonant and dissonant as explained in the following paragraphs consonant intervals produce a sensation of relaxation and dissonant intervals a sensation of tension the consonant intervals are considered to be the unison octave fifth fourth and major and minor third however harmonically the fourth interval is considered as a dissonance even though it s the inversion of a fifth therefore all the previous intervals are named as perfect consonant intervals while the fourth is categorized as imperfect consonant interval all the other intervals such as the 7th 9th 11th and 13th are considered dissonant and require resolution and usually preparation in the western tradition there are certain basic harmonies a basic chord consists of three notes the root the third above the root and the fifth above the root so in a c chord the notes are c e and g in an a flat chord the notes are ab c and eb in many types of music notably baroque and jazz basic chords are often augmented with tensions a tension is a degree of the scale which in a given key hits a dissonant interval the most basic common example of a tension is a seventh  so named because it is the seventh degree of the scale in a given key while the actual degree is a flat seventh the nomenclature is simply seventh so in a c7 chord the notes are c e g and bb other common dissonant tensions include ninths elevenths and thirteenths in jazz chords can become very complex with several tensions typically a dissonant chord will resolve to a consonant chord a good harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds in simple words that occurs when there is a balance between tension and relax moments because of this reason usually tensions are prepared and then resolved preparing a tension means to place a series of consonant chords that lead smoothly to the dissonant chord in this way the composer ensures to build up the tension of the piece smoothly without disturbing the listener once the piece reaches its sub climax the listener needs a moment of relaxation to clear up the tension which is obtained by playing a consonant chord that resolves the tensions of the previous chords the clearing of this tension usually sounds pleasant to the listener as frank zappa explained it the creation and destruction of harmonic and statistical tensions is essential to the maintenance of compositional drama any composition which remains consistent and regular throughout is for me equivalent to watching a movie with only good guys in it or eating cottage cheese in other words a composer cannot ensure a listener s liking by using exclusively consonant sounds however an excess of tension may disturb the listener the balance between the two is essential contemporary music has evolved in the way that tensions are less prepared and less structured than in baroque or classical periods thus producing new styles such as jazz and blues where tensions are usually not prepared art  beauty

the didgeridoo is a wind instrument of the aborigines of northern australia it is sometimes described as a natural wooden trumpet or drone pipe musicologists classify it as an aerophone the instrument is traditionally made from living eucalyptus trees which have had their interiors hollowed out by termites contrary to popular belief logs are not stuck into termite mounds for the termites to do the hollowing crafters would find suitable trees by knocking on the bark to see if it was hollow a modern didgeridoo is usually cylindrical or conical in shape and can measure anywhere from 1 to 3 m in length with most instruments measuring around 1 2 metres the length is directly related to the 1 2 sound wavelength of the keynote generally the longer the instrument the lower the pitch or key of the instrument keys from d to f are the preferred pitch of traditional aboriginal players there are no reliable sources stating the didgeridoo s exact age though it is commonly claimed to be the world s oldest wind instrument archaeological studies of rock art in northern australia suggests that the aboriginal people of the kakadu region of the northern territory have been using the didgeridoo for about 1500 years based on the dating of paintings on cave walls and shelters from this period a clear rock painting in ginga wardelirrhmeng from the freshwater period shows a didgeridoo player and two songmen in some aboriginal cultures only men are permitted to play it whereas women can only use clapsticks didgeridoo is considered to be an onomatopoetic word of western invention it has also been suggested that it may be derived from the irish words dúdaire or dúidire meaning variously trumpeter constant smoker puffer long necked person eavesdropper hummer crooner and dubh meaning black however this theory is not widely accepted the earliest occurrences of the word in print include a 1919 issue of smith s weekly where it was referred to as an infernal didjerry which produced but one sound didjerry didjerry didjerry and so on ad infinitum the 1919 australian national dictionary the bulletin in 1924 and the writings of herbert basedow in 1926 there are numerous names for this instrument among the aboriginal people of northern australia with yirdaki one of the better known words in modern western society yirdaki also sometimes spelt yidaki refers to the specific type of instrument made and used by the yolngu people of north east arnhem land many believe that it is a matter of etiquette to reserve tribal names for tribal instruments though retailers and businesses have been quick to exploit these special names for generic tourist oriented instruments authentic aboriginal didgeridoos are produced in traditionally oriented communities in northern australia and are usually made from hardwoods especially the various eucalyptus species that are endemic to the region sometimes a native bamboo such as bambusa arnhemica or pandanus is used generally the main trunk of the tree is harvested though a substantial branch may be used instead aboriginal didgeridoo craftsmen spend considerable time in the challenging search for a tree that has been hollowed out by termites to just the right degree if the hollow is too big or too small it will make a poor quality instrument when a suitable tree is found and cut down the segment of trunk or branch that will be made into a didgeridoo is cut out the bark is taken off the ends trimmed and some shaping of the exterior then results in a finished instrument this instrument may be painted or left undecorated a rim of beeswax may be applied to the mouthpiece end traditional instruments made by aboriginal craftsmen in arnhem land are sometimes fitted with a sugarbag wax mouthpiece this comes from wild bees and is black in appearance with a distinctive aroma didgeridoos are also made from pvc piping these generally have a 3 81 centimetres to 5 08 centimetres inside diameter and have a length corresponding to the desired key the mouthpiece is often made of the traditional beeswax or duct tape an appropriately sized rubber stopper with a hole cut into it is equally acceptable some have also found that finely sanding and buffing the end of the pipe creates a sufficient mouthpiece the didgeridoo is played with continuously vibrating lips to produce the drone while using a special breathing technique called circular breathing this requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously expelling air out of the mouth using the tongue and cheeks by use of this technique a skilled player can replenish the air in their lungs and with practice can sustain a note for as long as desired recordings exist of modern didgeridoo players playing continuously for more than 40 minutes mark atkins on didgeridoo concerto plays for over 50 minutes continuously fellow of the british society anthony baines wrote that the didgeridoo functions  as an aural kaleidoscope of timbres and that the extremely difficult virtuoso techniques developed by expert performers find no parallel elsewhere a termite bored didgeridoo has an irregular shape that overall usually increases in diameter towards the lower end this shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies that are not harmonically spaced in frequency this contrasts with the harmonic spacing of the resonances in a cylindrical plastic pipe whose resonant frequencies fall in the ratio 1 3 5 etc the second resonance of a didgeridoo is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency the vibration produced by the player s lips has harmonics i e it has frequency components falling exactly in the ratio 1 2 3 etc however the non harmonic spacing of the instrument s resonances means that the harmonics of the fundamental note are not systematically assisted by instrument resonances as is usually the case for western wind instruments sufficiently strong resonances of the vocal tract can strongly influence the timbre of the instrument at some frequencies whose values depend on the position of the player s tongue resonances of the vocal tract inhibit the oscillatory flow of air into the instrument bands of frequencies that are not thus inhibited produce formants in the output sound these formants and especially their variation during the inhalation and exhalation phases of circular breathing give the instrument its readily recognisable sound other variations in the didgeridoo s sound can be made with screeches most of the screeches are related to sounds emitted by australian animals such as the dingo or the kookaburra to produce these screeches the player simply has to cry out whilst continuing to blow air through it the results range from very high pitched sounds to much lower guttural vibrations the didgeridoo is sometimes played as a solo instrument for recreational purposes though more usually it accompanies dancing and singing in ceremonial rituals for aboriginal groups of northern australia the didgeridoo is an integral part of ceremonial life as it accompanies singers and dancers in religious rituals pair sticks sometimes called clapsticks or bilma establish the beat for the songs during ceremonies the rhythm of the didgeridoo and the beat of the clapsticks are precise and these patterns have been handed down for many generations only men play the didgeridoo and sing during ceremonial occasions whilst both men and women may dance the taboo against women playing the instrument is not absolute female aboriginal didgeridoo players did exist although their playing generally took place in an informal context and was not specifically encouraged linda barwick an ethnomusicologist says that traditionally women have not played the didgeridoo in ceremony but in informal situations there is no prohibition in the dreaming law on september 3 2008 however publisher harper collins was obliged to issue a public apology for its book the daring book for girls scheduled to be published in october which openly encouraged girls to play the instrument some sources state that the didgeridoo had other uses in ancient times there are sacred and even secret versions of the didgeridoo in aboriginal communities in parts of arnhem land northern territory and the surrounding areas these sorts of instruments have specific names and functions and some of these are played like typical didgeridoos whereas others are not in the 20th century several modernised versions of the didgeridoo have been developed the didjeribone a sliding didgeridoo made of plastic was invented in the second half of the 20th century by australian didgeridoo player charlie mcmahon it is constructed of two lengths of plastic tube one of which is slightly narrower in diameter than the other and which slides inside the wider tube in the manner of a slide trombone this allows players to achieve fundamental tones within the compass of a major sixth ranging from low b to high g the didgeridoo has also found a place in modern celtic music it can be seen played side by side with a set of great highland bagpipes in groups such as the wicked tinkers and brother a keyed didgeridoo was developed in the late 20th century by the u s didgeridoo player graham wiggins and used on his cds out of the woods and dust devils wiggins built the unique and somewhat unwieldy instrument in 1990 at the physics workshop of oxford university from which he earlier obtained his ph d the didgeridoo also became a role playing instrument in the experimental and avant garde music scene industrial music bands like test department and militia generated sounds from this instrument and used them in their industrial performances linking ecology to industry influenced by ethnic music and culture a 2005 study in the british medical journal found that learning and practising the didgeridoo helped reduce snoring and sleep apnea as well as daytime sleepiness this appears to work by strengthening muscles in the upper airway thus reducing their tendency to collapse during sleep in 2008 a couple of brazilian college students made a study about the use of didgeridoo for anxiety people they have stated that the instrument can lower a person s anxiety by practicing it 20 minutes a day for 7 weeks the average rate was 10 at anxiety decreasing also it indicates a better life quality through whoqol 2003 avaliation better breathing feelings and lower vulnerability to stress 
iron maiden are an english heavy metal band from leyton east london england formed in 1975 the band are led by founder bassist and songwriter steve harris since forming in 1975 they have released fourteen studio albums nine live albums four eps and eight compilations as a pioneer of the new wave of british heavy metal movement iron maiden rose to fame in the early 1980s and after several lineup changes they went on to release a string of platinum and gold albums these include the us platinum selling landmark the number of the beast in 1982 and the follow up piece of mind in 1983 iron maiden released their newest studio effort in 2006 entitled a matter of life and death which peaked at number nine on the billboard 200 and was certified gold in the uk as one of the most successful heavy metal bands of all time iron maiden have sold more than 70 million albums worldwide without significant mainstream or radio support the band won the ivor novello awards for international achievement in 2002 and were also inducted into the hollywood rockwalk in sunset boulevard los angeles california during their tour in the united states in 2005 their influences include thin lizzy ufo deep purple uriah heep and wishbone ash iron maiden were formed on christmas day 1975 by bassist steve harris shortly after he left his previous group smiler harris attributes the band name to a movie adaptation of the man in the iron mask from the novel by alexandre dumas and starring patrick mcgoohan which he saw around that time and so the group was christened after the purported torture device steve harris and guitarist dave murray remain the longest surviving members of iron maiden original vocalist paul day was fired as he lacked energy or charisma onstage he was replaced by dennis wilcock a kiss fan who utilised fire make up and fake blood during live performances wilcock s friend dave murray was invited to join to the frustration of guitarists dave sullivan and terry rance this fueled harris to temporarily split the band in 1976 though the group reformed soon after with murray as the sole guitarist iron maiden recruited another guitarist in 1977 bob sawyer who caused a rift between murray and wilcock prompting harris to fire both murray and sawyer a poor gig at the bridgehouse in november 1977 with a makeshift line up including tony moore on keyboards terry wapram on guitar and drummer barry purkis resulted in harris firing the entire band dave murray was reinstated and doug sampson was hired as drummer a chance meeting at the red lion pub in leytonstone evolved into a successful audition for vocalist paul di anno steve harris has stated there s sort of a quality in paul s voice a raspiness in his voice or whatever you want to call it that just gave it this great edge iron maiden had been playing for three years but had never recorded any of their music on new year s eve 1978 the band recorded a demo the soundhouse tapes featuring only three songs the band sold all five thousand copies within weeks one track found on the demo prowler went to number one on neal kay s heavy metal soundhouse charts in sounds magazine their first appearance on an album was on the compilation metal for muthas with two early versions of sanctuary and wrathchild from late 1977 to 1978 murray was the sole guitarist in the band until paul cairns joined in 1979 shortly before going into the studio cairns left the band several other guitarists were temporarily hired until the band finally settled on dennis stratton initially the band wanted to hire dave murray s childhood friend adrian smith but smith was busy with his own band urchin drummer doug sampson was also replaced by clive burr in december 1979 the band landed a major record deal with emi iron maiden s eponymous 1980 release iron maiden made number 4 in the uk albums chart in its first week of release and the group became one of the leading proponents of the new wave of british heavy metal movement in addition to the title track the album includes other early favourites such as running free transylvania phantom of the opera and sanctuary which was not on the original uk release but made the u s release and subsequent re releases the band played a headline tour of the uk then went on to open for kiss on their 1980 unmasked tour s european leg iron maiden also supported judas priest on select dates after the kiss tour dennis stratton was fired from the band as a result of creative and personal differences stratton was replaced by adrian smith in october 1980 in 1981 maiden released their second album titled killers this new album contained many tracks that had been written prior to the release of the debut album but were considered surplus with songs already shaped on the road well in advance only two new tracks were written for the album prodigal son and murders in the rue morgue by 1981 paul di anno was demonstrating increasingly self destructive behaviour particularly through cocaine usage his performances began to suffer just as the band was beginning to achieve large scale success in america at the end of 1981 the band fired di anno and began to seek a new vocalist bruce dickinson previously of samson auditioned for iron maiden in september 1981 and joined the band shortly afterwards he then went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in anticipation of the band s forthcoming album the band played children of the damned run to the hills 22 acacia avenue and the prisoner at select venues introducing fans to the sound that the band was progressing towards dickinson s recorded debut with iron maiden was 1982 s the number of the beast an album that claimed the band their first ever uk albums chart 1 record and additionally became a top ten hit in many other countries for the second time the band went on a world tour visiting the united states canada japan australia uk and germany the tour s u s leg was marred by controversy stemming from an american right wing political pressure group that claimed iron maiden was satanic because of the new album s title track the band members attempts to deflect the criticism failed to dampen persistent accusations a group of christian activists went on to destroy iron maiden records in protest against the band dickinson at the time was still in legal difficulties with samson s management and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits however he was still able to lend creative influence to many of the songs in a guitar legends interview he claims he contributed to the overall themes of children of the damned the prisoner and run to the hills in december 1982 drummer clive burr left the band due to personal and tour schedule problems he was replaced by nicko mcbrain previously of french band trust shortly afterwards in 1983 the band released piece of mind which was their first album to go platinum in the united states following the success of piece of mind the band released powerslave on september 9 1984 the album featured fan favourites 2 minutes to midnight aces high and rime of the ancient mariner the latter based on samuel taylor coleridge s poem of the same name and running over 13 minutes in length back in the village followed up on an earlier hit the prisoner both based on the television show starring patrick mcgoohan the tour following the album dubbed the world slavery tour was the band s biggest to date and consisted of 193 shows over 13 months this was one of the biggest tours in music history many shows were played back to back in the same city such as in long beach california where most of the recordings were made for their subsequent live release live after death this tour was physically grueling for the band and they took a 6 month break when it ended this was the first break in the band s history including even cancelling a proposed supporting tour for the new live album returning from their break the band adopted a different approach for their 1986 studio album titled somewhere in time this was not a concept album though it was themed loosely around the idea of time travel and associated themes history the passage of time and long journeys it featured for the first time in the band s history synthesized bass and guitars sounds to add textures and layers to the sound though considered different from the norm of maiden sounds it charted well across the world especially with the single wasted years the experimentation on somewhere in time led to a follow up in seventh son of a seventh son in 1988 adding to iron maiden s experimentation it was a concept album featuring a story about a mythical child who possessed clairvoyant powers for the first time the band used keyboards on a recording as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release critics stated this produced a more accessible release it was a huge success and became the band s second album to

popular stop for many tourists in 654 bc phoenician settlers founded a port in the balearic islands as ibossim it was later known to romans as ebusus the greeks who came to ibiza during the time of the phoenicians were the first to call the two islands of ibiza and formentera the pityûssai with the decline of phoenicia after the assyrian invasions ibiza came under the control of carthage also a former phoenician colony the island produced dye salt fish sauce and wool a shrine with offerings to the goddess tanit was established in the cave at es culleram and the rest of the balearic islands entered eivissa s commercial orbit after 400 bc ibiza was a major trading post along the mediterranean routes ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby balearic island of majorca such as na guardis from which large quantities of renowned balearic slingers were hired as mercenaries who fought for carthage during the second punic war the island was assaulted by the two scipio brothers in 209 bc but remained loyal to carthage with carthaginian military luck running out on the iberian mainland ibiza was last used by the fleeing carthaginian general mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to minorca and then to liguria ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty with the romans which spared ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its carthaginian punic institutions well into the empire days when it became an official roman municipality for this reason ibiza today offers excellent examples of late carthaginian punic civilization during the roman empire the island became a quiet imperial outpost removed from the important trading routes of the time after the fall of the roman empire and a brief period of first vandal and then byzantine rule the island was conquered by the moors as well as much of the iberian peninsula under islamic rule ibiza came in close contact with the city of dénia as the two areas were administered jointly by the same taifa moreover the tribes who lived in ibiza and denia during the period 1060 1085 were moorish tribes named bno alaglab bano mujahed the island was reclaimed for christendom by aragonese king james i of aragon in 1235 since then the island has had its own self government in several forms but in 1715 king philip v of spain abolished the local government s autonomy the arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the statute of autonomy of the balearic islands today the island is part of the balearic autonomous community along with majorca minorca and formentera ibiza is a part of a group of the western balearic archipelago called the pitiusas or pine islands composed of itself and formentera the balearic island chain includes over fifty islands many of them uninhabited

hottest time of the year is july and august with temperatures reaching 30  c most afternoons the lowest recorded temperature in ibiza is 5  c the highest is 37  c while catalan and spanish are the official languages of ibiza a dialectal variation called eivissenc or ibicenco is more readily spoken by both the residents and those of formentera additionally because of the influence of tourism and expatriates living in or maintaining residences on the island other atypical languages such as english german and russian are also spoken polylinguality is the norm not the exception ibiza is considered a popular tourist destination especially due to its legendary and at times riotous nightlife centered around two areas ibiza town the island s capital on the southern shore and sant antoni to the west well known nightclubs are privilege eden es paradís amnesia space pacha and dc10 during the summer well known djs perform at the various clubs on weekly schedules in between touring to

at the start of june with space and dc10 s opening parties and finishes on the first weekend of october with the closing parties a typical schedule for clubbers going to ibiza includes waking at noon

known is café del mar a long standing bar where many tourists traditionally view the sunset made famous by josé padilla that and other bars close by have become an increasingly popular venue for club pre parties after sunset hosting popular dj performers the island s government is trying to encourage a more cultured and quieter tourism scene passing rules including the closing of all nightclubs by 6am at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5 star the administration is wanting to attract a more international mixture of tourists rather than british who have a bad reputation for violent aggresive binge drinking though primarily known for its party scene large portions of the island are registered as u n world heritage sites and thus protected from the development and commercialization of the main cities a notable example includes god s finger in the benirràs bay as well as some of the more traditional ibicenco cultural sites because of its rustic beauty companies

can were an experimental rock band formed in west germany in 1968 one of the most important krautrock groups can incorporated strong minimalist and world music influences can constructed their music largely through free improvisation and editing which bassist holger czukay has referred to as instant compositions they had only occasional commercial success with singles such as spoon and i want more reaching national singles charts however through albums such as tago mago and ege bamyasi can exerted a considerable influence on avant garde experimental underground ambient new wave and electronic music can formed in cologne in 1968 comprising bass guitarist holger czukay keyboard player irmin schmidt guitarist michael karoli and drummer jaki liebezeit along with original member david johnson an american composer flutist and electronic musician who left at the end of 1968 after the band had begun taking a more rock oriented direction czukays and schmidt s musical orientations up until that point had been exclusively avant garde classical while liebezeit had played in jazz groups until joining can they used the names inner space and the can before finally settling on can liebezeit subsequently suggested the backronym communism anarchism nihilism for the band s name in the autumn of 1968 the band enlisted the creative highly rhythmic but unstable and often confrontational american malcolm mooney a new york based sculptor with whom they recorded the material for an album prepared to meet thy pnoom this first album contained two of the titles from the subsequent monster movie album though in earlier versions unable to find a recording company willing to release the album the group continued their studio work until they had material for what became their debut album monster movie released in 1969 other material recorded around the same time was released in 1981 as delay 1968 mooney s bizarre ranting vocals emphasized the sheer strangeness and hypnotic quality of the music which was influenced particularly by garage rock funk and psychedelic rock repetition was stressed on bass and drums particularly on the epic yoo doo right which had been edited down from a twelve hour improvisation to take up a mere single side of vinyl liebezeit was the driving force behind the band and one of the greatest and most neglected drummers in all of rock music mooney returned to america soon afterwards on the advice of a psychiatrist having been told that getting away from the chaotic music of can would be better for his mental health he was replaced by the more understated kenji damo suzuki a young japanese traveller found busking outside a munich cafe by czukay and liebezeit though he only knew a handful of guitar chords and improvised the majority of his lyrics suzuki was asked to perform with the band that same night the band s first record with suzuki was soundtracks released in 1970 a compilation of music made for films that also contained two earlier tracks recorded with mooney suzuki s lyrics were usually in english though sometimes in japanese the next few years saw can release their most acclaimed works which arguably did as much to define the krautrock genre as those of any other group while their earlier recordings tended to be loosely based on traditional song structures on their mid career albums the band reverted to an extremely fluid improvisational style the double album tago mago is often seen as a groundbreaking influential and deeply unconventional record based on intensely rhythmic jazz inspired drumming improvised guitar and keyboard soloing tape edits as composition and suzuki s idiosyncratic vocalisms tago mago was followed by ege bamyasi a more accessible but still avant garde record which featured the catchy vitamin c and the top 40 german hit spoon next was future days an unassuming but quietly complex record which represents an early example of ambient music and is perhaps the band s most critically successful record also included on this album was the refreshingly unexpected pop song moonshake suzuki left soon after the recording of the latter album to marry his german wife and become a jehovah s witness the vocals were taken over by karoli and schmidt however after the departure of suzuki fewer of their tracks featured vocals as can found themselves experimenting with the ambient music they had begun with future days soon over babaluma from 1974 continued in the ambient style of future days though regaining some of the abrasive edge of tago mago and ege bamyasi in 1975 can signed to virgin records in the uk and emi harvest in germany the albums landed and flow motion saw can moving towards a somewhat more conventional style as their recording technology improved accordingly the disco single i want more from flow motion became their only hit record outside of germany written by their live sound mixer peter gilmour it reached no 26 in the uk charts in august 1976 which prompted an appearance on top of the pops in 1977 can were joined by former traffic bassist rosko gee and percussionist rebop kwaku baah both of whom provided vocals to can s music appearing on the albums saw delight out of reach and can during this period holger czukay was pushed to the fringes of the group s activity in fact he just made sounds using shortwave radios morse code keys tape recorders and other sundry objects he left can in late 1977 and did not appear on the albums out of reach or can although he did do some production work on the latter album can went on hiatus shortly afterwards but reunions have taken place on several occasions since since the split all the former members have been involved in musical projects often as session musicians for other artists in 1986 they briefly reformed with original vocalist moody to record rite time there was a further reunion in 1991 to record a track for the wim wenders film until the end of the world and can have since been the subject of numerous compilations live albums and samples in 1999 the four core members of can karoli liebezeit schmidt and czukay performed live at the same show although playing separately with their current solo projects michael karoli died on 17 november 2001 after a long battle with cancer in 2004 the band began a series of super audio cd remasters of its back catalog which were finished in 2006 holger czukay has recorded several ambient albums and collaborated with david sylvian among others jaki liebezeit has played extensively with bassists jah wobble and bill laswell and in a drum ensemble called drums of chaos and in 2005 with the artist datenverarbeiter the online album givt michael karoli recorded a reggae album with polly eltes before his passing and irmin schmidt has begun working with the acclaimed drummer martin atkins producing a remix for the industrial band the damage manual and a cover of banging the door for a public image ltd tribute album both released on atkins label invisible records karoli formed sofortkontakt for the can reunion shows in 1999 with mark spybey who had previously been associated with dead voices on air zoviet france reformed faction and download the band also featured alexander schoenert felix guttierez of jelly planet and mandjao fati karoli also performed on numerous occasions with damo suzuki s network damo suzuki returned to music in 1983 and since then he has been playing live improvisational shows around the world with local musicians and members of touring bands at various points sometimes issuing live albums malcolm mooney recorded an album as singer for the band tenth planet in 1998 rosko gee has been the bassist in the live band on harald schmidt s tv show in germany since 1995 rebop kwaku baah died in 1983 following a brain haemorrhage the diversity of the music of can owes a lot to its equally eclectic influences holger czukay and irmin schmidt were both pupils of karlheinz stockhausen this meant that the early can inherited a strong grounding in his musical theory with the latter being trained as a classical pianist michael karoli in turn was a pupil of holger czukay and brought the influence of gypsy music through his esoteric studies drummer jaki liebezeit had strong jazz leanings another important early influence was ethnomusicology the band s sound was originally intended to be based more on the sound of ethnic music so when the band decided to pick up the garage rock sound original member david johnson left the band this world music trend was later more clearly exemplified on albums such as ege bamyasi future days and saw delight and by incorporating new band members with different nationalities a series of tracks on can albums known as ethnological forgery series abbreviated to e f s demonstrated the band s ability to successfully recreate ethnic sounding music the band s early influences in rock included the beatles and the velvet underground as well as jimi hendrix sly stone and frank zappa the band have admitted that the beginning of can s father cannot yell was inspired by the velvet underground s european son malcolm mooney s voice has been compared to that of james brown and their early style rooted in psychedelic music drew comparisons with pink floyd along with their peers in the krautrock scene they were under the influence of the wider progressive rock movement taking place in england and elsewhere during the late 1960s and early 1970s czukay s extensive editing has occasionally been compared to the late 60s music of trumpeter miles davis can and davis both would record long groove intensive improvisations then edit the best bits together for their albums czukay and teo macero both had roots in the musique concrète of the 1940s and 50s however perhaps the last words should go to irmin schmidt in a discussion with michael karoli in 1996 concerning the various citations of influences upon their music you know it s funny that in spite of all the supposed influences on us that have been written about the one over riding influence has never been mentioned michael von biel damo suzuki was a very different sort of singer from mooney his multilingual often inscrutable vocal style added the missing ingredient to a set of playful pop songs with suzuki the band made their most well known albums and the rhythm section s work on tago mago has been especially praised one critic writes that much of the album is based on long improvisations built around hypnotic rhythm patterns another writes that halleluhwah finds them pounding out a monster trance funk beat the band s post damo suzuki period has been criticised for not being as groundbreaking and genre defining as the earlier albums although critics had praised can s sound in the early 1970s as being ahead of its time the band just used a two track recorder until the release of landed in 1975 however they do try out styles they hadn t done before landed sees them influenced by glam rock flow motion by reggae saw delight and out of reach by world music again and the guitar of carlos santana major artists working in the post punk genre such as the fall public image ltd siouxsie and the banshees at the drive in the mars volta joy division and other acts like david bowie talking heads the stone roses and primal scream have cited can as an influence brian eno made a short film in tribute to can while john frusciante of the red hot chili peppers appeared at the echo awards ceremony at which can were awarded the most prestigious music award in germany to pay tribute to guitarist michael karoli john lydon formerly of the sex pistols formed public image limited patterned after can s early 1970s five member lineup lydon was mooted as a possible singer for the band but initial conversations amounted to nothing much to can addict jah wobble s dismay during their kid a tour radiohead performed a cover of the song thief from delay 1968 and have claimed can as an influence mark e smith of the fall pays tribute to damo suzuki with the track i am damo suzuki on the 1985 album this nation s saving grace the jesus and mary chain used to cover mushroom live in the mid 1980s the flaming lips wrote their song take meta mars off their in a priest driven ambulance album after hearing mushroom just once the songs bear great resemblance at least four notable bands have named themselves in tribute to can the mooney suzuki for malcolm mooney and damo suzuki the indie rock band spoon after the hit spoon the electronic band egebamyasi formed by scottish musician mr egg in 1984 after can s album ege bamyasi hunters collectors after a song on the landed album and moonshake named for a track on future days and formed by ex wolfhounds frontman david callahan the scottish writer alan warner born in oban in 1964 has written two novels in tribute to two different can members the sacrilege remix album features remixes of can tracks by artists who were influenced by can including sonic youth and u n k l e their ethnomusicological tendencies pre date the craze for world music in the 1980s while not nearly as influential on electronic music as kraftwerk they were important early pioneers of ambient music along with tangerine dream and the aforementioned band many groups working in the post rock genre can look to can as an influence as part of the larger krautrock scene as can new prog bands such as the mars volta kanye west has sampled sing swan song on his song drunk hot girls from his 2007 album graduation nu krautrock pioneers die plankton cite can as one of their main influences alongside faust and neu the u k band loop was deeply influenced by can for their repetitive polyrhythmic style covering can s mother sky on their fade out album besides this can also influenced classical avantgarde composers such as bernhard lang and karlheinz essl much of can s music was based on free improvisation and then edited into a palatable format for the studio albums for example when preparing a soundtrack only irmin schmidt would view the film and then give the rest of the band a general description of the scenes they would be scoring this assisted in the improvised soundtrack being successful both inside and outside the film s context also the epic track cutaway from unlimited edition demonstrates how tape editing and extensive jamming could be used to create a sound collage that doesn t gel perfectly and that the flashes of genius in the improvisation needed to be cut from long unconsolidated recordings can s live shows often melded spontaneous improvisation of this kind with songs appearing on their albums the track colchester finale appearing on the can live album incorporates portions of halleluhwah into a composition lasting over half an hour early concerts found mooney and suzuki often able to shock audiences with their unusual vocal styles as different as they were from one another suzuki s debut performance with can in 1970 nearly frightened an audience to the point of rioting due to his odd style of vocalizing the actor david niven was amongst the crowd who remained to hear what can and damo would do next after the departure of suzuki the music grew in intensity without a vocal centre the band maintained their ability to collectively improvise with or without central themes for hours at a time resulting in a large archive of performances can made attempts to find a new vocalist after the departure of damo suzuki although no one quite fit the position in 1975 folk singer tim hardin took the lead vocal spot and played guitar with can for one song at two gigs performing his own the lady came from baltimore malaysian thaiga raj raja ratnam played four dates with the band between january and march 1976 all of which were recorded and did considerable studio work with them another vocalist englishman michael cousins toured with can in march and april 1976 audiences in france disapproved of his presence and literally spat at him while on stage there are eight recordings of cousins performing with the band 
virgin killer is the fourth studio album by the german heavy metal band scorpions it was released in 1976 and was the first album of the band to attract attention outside europe the title is described as being a reference to time as the killer of innocence the original cover featuring a naked prepubescent girl stirred controversy in the uk us and elsewhere as a result the album was reissued with a different cover in some countries in december 2008 the image again gave rise to controversy when the british internet watch foundation placed certain pages from the encyclopedia wikipedia on its internet blacklist since it considered the image to be potentially illegal under current uk law this resulted in much of the uk being prevented from editing wikipedia and significant public debate of the decision the decision was reversed by the iwf after four days of blocking virgin killer shared the same fate as the other scorpions albums featuring lead guitarist uli jon roth it failed to attain any serious attention in the united states but was quite popular in japan where it peaked at number 32 in the charts the album was another step in the band s shift from psychedelic music to hard rock critic vincent jeffries of allmusic contends in hindsight that the album was the first of four studio releases that really defined the scorpions and their urgent metallic sound that was to become highly influential he also counts the title track and pictured life among the all time scorpions standouts among the band members uli jon roth considers virgin killer and the previous release in trance as his favourite scorpions albums the original cover art for the album depicted a naked ten year old girl named jaqueline with a shattered glass crack effect obscuring her genitals the image was designed by steffan böhle who was then the product manager for rca records francis buchholz was the bassist for the band and in an interview conducted in early 2007 recollects that the model depicted on the cover was either the daughter or the niece of the guy who did the cover design the photograph was taken by michael von gimbut the band s rhythm guitarist rudolf schenker offers the following description of the circumstances behind the album cover we didn t actually have the idea it was the record company the record company guys were like even if we have to go to jail there s no question that we ll release that on the song virgin killer time is the virgin killer but then when we had to do the interviews about it we said look listen to the lyrics and then you ll know what we re talking about we re using this only to get attention that s what we do even the girl when we met her fifteen years later had no problem with the cover growing up in europe sexuality of course not with children was very normal the lyrics really say it all time is the virgin killer a kid comes into the world very naive they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble that was the basic idea about all of it in a separate interview schenker also notes that he thought the cover art was a great thing and that he had pushed the band to really stay behind it as he felt that people would think differently when they looked at the lyrics and realized that the cover art was only being used as a symbol of the lyrics in a 2008 interview schenker added we would never again do something like this the band s former lead guitarist uli jon roth notes that the cover art of the old scorpion albums were usually done by other people he has since expressed regret over the original album cover looking at that picture today makes me cringe it was done in the worst possible taste back then i was too immature to see that shame on me  i should have done everything in my power to stop it the record company came up with the idea i think the lyrics incidentally were a take off on kiss whom we had just supported on a tour i was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised cause he s a virgin killer trying to do a more or less way off the mark paul stanley impersonation klaus immediately said that s great you should do something with it then i had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title which i actually managed to do to some degree but the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first virgin killer is none other than the demon of our time the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today  brutally trampling upon the heart and soul of innocence in 2008 photographer michael von gimbut emphasized that his wife the model s mother and sister and three female assistants had been present during the shooting and stated back then we loved and protected the children and did not sleep with them the cover generated controversy the album could only be sold sealed in black plastic in several countries and the cover was replaced in some countries with an alternate cover art depicting the band members the original is named in various worst album cover lists cracked magazine online named it the 1 worst album cover of all time while gigwise com lists it as 2 on its march 2008 the 50 most controversial album covers of all time list similarly it was named by ugo networks as one of the weirdest album covers and placed 6 on the all time worst album covers list made by two one five magazine this would not be the last time that the band attracted controversy with their album covers their next album taken by force originally featured cover art that depicted children playing with guns at a military cemetery in france and some people found that offensive their 1979 album lovedrive featured a bizarre artwork that depicts a woman on the back seat of a car with bubblegum over her breast both covers were replaced by an alternate design vocalist klaus meine explains that the band s penchant for controversial cover art stems from a desire to go over the edge and not to offend some people or make the headlines that would be stupid in may 2008 the us based social conservative site worldnetdaily reported the cover image on wikipedia to the federal bureau of investigation an officer of the concerned women for america a conservative christian advocacy group commented by allowing that image to remain posted wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and pedophilia econtent magazine subsequently reported the wikipedia community s internal debate as concluding prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the virgin killer cover will not be removed and asserted that wikipedia contributors favor inclusion in all but the most extreme cases in december 2008 the internet watch foundation a uk based non government organization added the wikipedia article virgin killer to its internet blacklist due to concerns over legality of the image which had been assessed as the lowest level of legal concern erotic posing with no sexual activity as a result people using many major uk isps were blocked from viewing the entire article by the cleanfeed system and a large part of the u k was blocked from editing wikipedia due to the means of blocking in use following discussion representations by the wikimedia foundation and public complaints the iwf reversed their decision three days later and confirmed that in future they would not block copies of the image that were hosted overseas

muscle memory is a common term for neuromuscular facilitation which is the process of the neuromuscular system memorizing motor skills when an active person repeatedly trains movement often of the same activity in an effort to stimulate the mind s adaptation process the outcome is to induce physiological changes which attain increased levels of accuracy through repetition even though the process is really brain muscle memory or motor memory the colloquial expression muscle memory is commonly used individuals rely upon the mind s ability to assimilate a given activity and adapt to the training as the brain and muscle adapts to training the subsequent changes are a form or representation of its muscle memory there are two types of motor skills involved in muscle memory fine and gross fine motor skills are very minute and small skills we perform with our hands such as brushing teeth combing hair using a pencil or pen to write touch typing playing some musical instruments or even playing video games gross motor skills are those actions that require large body parts and large body movements as in the throwing sports such as bowling american football and baseball sports such as rowing basketball golf martial arts and tennis and activities such as driving a car piloting aircraft playing some musical instruments and marksmanship muscle memory is fashioned over time through repetition of a given suite of motor skills and the ability through brain activity to inculcate and instill it such that they become automatic to the beginner activities such as brushing the teeth combing the hair or even driving a vehicle are not as easy as they look as one reinforces those movements through repetition the neural system learns those fine and gross motor skills to the degree that one no longer needs to think about them but merely to react and perform appropriately in this sense the muscle memory process is an example of automating an ooda loop insofar as one learns to observe orient decide and act when one picks up a hair brush one automatically has a certain motion style number of strokes and amount of pressure as the hair is brushed without requiring conscious thought about each movement other forms of rather elaborate motions that have become automatic include speech as one speaks one usually does not consciously think about the complex tongue movements synchronisation with vocal cords and various lip movements that are required to produce phonemes because of muscle memory in speaking a language that is not one s native language one typically speaks with an accent because one s muscle memory is tuned to forming the phonemes of one s native language rather than those of the language one is speaking an accent can be eliminated only by carefully retraining the muscle memory neuromuscular facilitation is the process by which a fixed size signal from motor neurons onto muscles causes an increase in the contraction of a muscle this seems to occur because of an increased amount of acetylcholine being released onto the muscle cells for a signal of a fixed size this process may also be called muscle memory muscle memory in the context of weight training and bodybuilding implies a different scenario than mere instinctive memorization of various motor skills muscle memory can also imply that muscle can be gained back rapidly after one consistently trains for a given period of time takes a pronounced break from weight training and then returns to weight training thus the muscle maintains muscle memory of its previous superior conditioning

current drummer is matt cameron formerly of soundgarden who has been with the band since 1998 formed after the demise of ament and gossard s previous band mother love bone pearl jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album ten one of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s pearl jam was criticized early on most notably by nirvana frontman kurt cobain as being a corporate cash in on the alternative rock explosion however over the course of the band s career its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much publicized boycott of ticketmaster in 2006 rolling stone described the band as having spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame since its inception the band has sold over thirty million records in the u s and an estimated sixty million albums worldwide pearl jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade allmusic calls pearl jam the most popular american rock roll band of the 90s stone gossard and jeff ament were members of pioneering grunge band green river during the mid 1980s green river toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates mark arm and steve turner in late 1987 gossard and ament began playing with malfunkshun vocalist andrew wood eventually organizing the band mother love bone in 1988 and 1989 the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the polygram record label which signed the band in early 1989 mother love bone s debut album apple was released in july 1990 four months after wood died of a heroin overdose ament and gossard were devastated by the death of wood and the resulting demise of mother love bone gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder edged than what he had been doing previously after a few months gossard started practicing with fellow seattle guitarist mike mccready whose band shadow had broken up mccready in turn encouraged gossard to reconnect with ament after practicing for a while the trio sent out a five song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer they gave former red hot chili peppers drummer jack irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball buddy san diego california singer eddie vedder vedder was the lead vocalist for a san diego band bad radio and worked part time at a gas station he listened to the tape shortly before going surfing where lyrics came to him he then recorded the vocals to three of the songs in what he would later describe as a mini opera he entitled mamasan vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three seattle musicians who were so impressed that they had him fly to seattle within a week vedder had joined the band with the addition of dave krusen on drums the band took the name mookie blaylock in reference to the then active all star basketball player the band played its first official show at the off ramp café in seattle on october 22 1990 and soon signed to epic records however concerns about trademark issues necessitated a name change the band s name became pearl jam in an early promotional interview vedder said that the name pearl jam was a reference to his great grandmother pearl who was married to a native american and had a special recipe for peyote laced jam in a 2006 rolling stone cover story however vedder admitted that this story was total bullshit ament and mccready explained that ament came up with pearl and that the band later settled on pearl jam after attending a concert by neil young in which he stretched up his songs as improvisations of 15 20 minutes in length a practice known as jamming pearl jam entered seattle s london bridge studios in march 1991 to record its debut album ten mccready said that ten was mostly stone and jeff me and eddie were along for the ride at that time krusen left the band in may 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation he was replaced by matt chamberlain who had previously played with edie brickell new bohemians after playing only a handful of shows one of which was filmed for the alive video chamberlain left to join the saturday night live band chamberlain suggested dave abbruzzese as his replacement abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of pearl jam s live shows supporting ten released on august 27 1991 ten contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression suicide loneliness and murder ten s musical style influenced by classic rock combined an expansive harmonic vocabulary with an anthemic sound the album was slow to sell but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success being certified gold and reaching number two on the billboard charts ten produced the hit singles alive even flow and jeremy originally interpreted as an anthem by many vedder later revealed that alive tells the semi biographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather while his mother s grief turns her to sexually embrace her son who strongly resembles the biological father the song jeremy and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates ten stayed on the billboard charts for more than two years and has gone on to become one of the highest selling rock records ever going thirteen times platinum with the success of ten pearl jam became a key member of the seattle grunge explosion along with nirvana alice in chains and soundgarden the band was criticized in the music press british music magazine nme said that pearl jam was trying to steal money from young alternative kids pockets nirvana s kurt cobain angrily attacked pearl jam claiming the band were commercial sellouts and argued ten was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads cobain later reconciled with vedder and they reportedly were on amicable terms before cobain s death in 1994 pearl jam toured relentlessly in support of ten ament stated that essentially ten was just an excuse to tour adding we told the record company we know we can be a great band so let s just get the opportunity to get out and play the band s manager kelly curtis stated once people came and saw them live this lightbulb would go on doing their first tour you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it early on in pearl jam s career the band became known for its intense live performances looking back at this time vedder said that playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff it s just like an untamed force but it didn t come from jock mentality it came from just being let out of the gates in 1992 pearl jam made television appearances on saturday night live and mtv unplugged and took a slot on that summer s lollapalooza tour with the red hot chili peppers soundgarden and ministry among others the band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 cameron crowe film singles state of love and trust and breath ament gossard and vedder appeared in singles under the name citizen dick their parts were filmed when pearl jam was known as mookie blaylock the band members grew uncomfortable with their success with much of the burden of pearl jam s popularity falling on frontman vedder while pearl jam received four awards at the 1993 mtv video music awards for its video for jeremy including video of the year and best group video the band refused to make a video for black in spite of pressure by the label this action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs ten years from now ament said i don t want people to remember our songs as videos pearl jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut mccready said the band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy released on october 19 1993 pearl jam s second album vs sold a record 950 378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the billboard top ten that week combined vs included the singles go daughter animal and dissident paul evans of rolling stone said few american bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with ten and vs tops even that debut he added like jim morrison and pete townshend vedder makes a forte of his psychological mythic explorations as guitarists stone gossard and mike mccready paint dense and slashing backdrops he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife the band decided beginning with the release of vs to scale back its commercial efforts the members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of jeremy and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances industry insiders compared pearl jam s tour that year to the touring habits of led zeppelin in that the band ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans during the vs tour the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers by 1994 pearl jam was fighting on all fronts as its manager described the band at the time pearl jam was outraged when after it played a pair of shows in chicago illinois it discovered that ticket vendor ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets the united states department of justice was investigating the company s practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company gossard and ament soon testified at a subcommittee investigation in washington d c the band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest after the justice department dropped the case pearl jam continued to boycott ticketmaster refusing to play venues that had contracts with the company music critic jim derogatis noted that along with the ticketmaster debacle the band has refused to release singles or make videos it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl and it wants to be more like its 60s heroes the who releasing two or three albums a year he also stated that sources said that most of the band s third album vitalogy was completed by early 1994 but that either a forced delay by epic or the battle with ticketmaster were to blame for the delay pearl jam wrote and recorded while touring behind vs and the majority of the tracks for its next album vitalogy were recorded during breaks on the tour tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time producer brendan o brien said vitalogy was a little strained i m being polite there was some imploding going on after pearl jam finished the recording of vitalogy drummer dave abbruzzese was fired the band cited political differences between abbruzzese and the other members for example abbruzzese disagreed with the ticketmaster boycott he was replaced by jack irons a close friend of vedder and the former and original drummer of the red hot chili peppers irons made his debut with the band at neil young s 1994 bridge school benefit but he was not officially announced as the band s new drummer until its 1995 self pollution satellite radio broadcast a four and a half hour long pirate broadcast out of seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it vitalogy was released first on november 22 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on december 6 1994 on cd and cassette the cd became the second fastest selling in history with more than 877 000 units sold in its first week stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic said that thanks to its stripped down lean production vitalogy stands as pearl jam s most original and uncompromising album many of the songs on the album appear to be based around the pressures of fame the song spin the black circle a homage to vinyl records won a grammy award in 1996 for best hard rock performance vitalogy also included the songs not for you corduroy better man and immortality better man  a song originally penned and performed by vedder while in bad radio reached number one on the billboard mainstream rock chart spending a total of eight weeks there considered a blatantly great pop song by producer brendan o brien pearl jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from vs due to its accessibility the band continued its boycott against ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for vitalogy but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in pearl jam s initiative to play only at non ticketmaster venues effectively with a few exceptions prevented it from playing shows in the united states for the next three years ament later said we were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour had to prove we could tour on our own and it pretty much killed us killed our career in the same year pearl jam backed neil young whom the band had noted as an influence on his album mirror ball contractual obligations prevented the use of the band s name anywhere on the album but the members were all credited individually in the album s liner notes two songs from the sessions were left off mirror ball i got id and long road these two tracks were released separately by pearl jam in the form of the 1995 ep merkin ball following the round of touring for vitalogy the band went into the studio to record its follow up no code vedder said making no code was all about gaining perspective released on august 27 1996 no code was seen as a deliberate break from the band s sound since ten favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers david browne of entertainment weekly stated that no code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous pearl jam album the lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self examination with ament stating in some ways it s like the band s story it s about growing up although the album debuted at number one on the billboard charts it quickly fell down the charts no code included the singles who you are hail hail and off he goes as with vitalogy very little touring was done to promote no code because of the band s refusal to play in ticketmaster s venue areas a european tour took place in the fall of 1996 gossard stated that there was a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time and that it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band following the short tour for no code the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow up the sessions for the band s fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group with ament stating that everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record because of that everybody feels like they re an integral part of the band on february 3 1998 pearl jam released its fifth album yield the album was cited as a return to the band s early straightforward rock sound tom sinclair of entertainment weekly stated that the band has turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy acoustic based ruminations perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt rock ambassadors with any degree of clout they ve come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut ten lyrically yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on no code with vedder saying what was rage in the past has become reflection yield debuted at number two on the billboard charts but like no code soon began dropping down the charts it included the singles given to fly and wishlist the band hired comic book artist todd mcfarlane to create an animated video for the song do the evolution from the album its first music video since 1992 a documentary detailing the making of yield single video theory was released on vhs and dvd later that year in april 1998 pearl jam once again changed drummers jack irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former soundgarden drummer matt cameron on an initially temporary basis but he soon became a permanent replacement for irons pearl jam s 1998 yield tour in north america marked the band s return to full scale touring the band s anti trust lawsuit against ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non ticketmaster venues which were judged to be out of the way and impersonal for this tour and future tours pearl jam once again began using ticketmaster in order to better accommodate concertgoers the 1998 summer tour was a big success and after it was completed the band released live on two legs a live album which featured select performances from the tour in 1998 pearl jam recorded last kiss a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by j frank wilson and the cavaliers it was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band s 1998 fan club christmas single the following year the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country by popular demand the cover was released to the general public as a single in 1999 with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the kosovo war the band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album no boundaries a benefit for the kosovar refugees last kiss peaked at number two on the billboard charts and became the band s highest charting single following its full scale tour in support of yield the band took a short break but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album on may 16 2000 pearl jam released its sixth studio album binaural it was drummer matt cameron s studio recording debut with the band the title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer tchad blake known for his use of the technique binaural was the first album since the band s debut not produced by brendan o brien although o brien was called in later to remix several tracks gossard stated that the band were ready for a change jon pareles of rolling stone said apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except creed fans pearl jam delve elsewhere he added the album reflects both pearl jam s longstanding curse of self importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd the album is lyrically darker than the band s previous album yield with gossard describing the lyrics as pretty sombre binaural included the singles nothing as it seems  one of the songs featuring binaural recording and light years the album sold just over 700 000 copies and became the first pearl jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status pearl jam decided to record every show on its 2000 binaural tour professionally after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of illegal bootleg recordings the band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings and these official bootlegs were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans pearl jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members but the band s record contract prevented it from doing so pearl jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club the band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001 and set a record for most albums to debut in the billboard 200 at the same time pearl jam s 2000 european tour ended in tragedy on june 30 with an accident at the roskilde festival in denmark nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening but it was already too late the two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and the band seriously considered retiring after this event pearl jam was initially blamed for the accident but was later cleared of responsibility a month after the european tour concluded the band embarked on its two leg 2000 north american tour on performing after the roskilde tragedy vedder said that playing facing crowds being together it enabled us to start processing it on october 22 2000 the band played the mgm grand in las vegas celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years he noted that i would never do this accepting a grammy or something the song alive was purposely omitted from all shows on this tour until the final night in seattle the band performed that night for over three hours playing most of its hits along with covers such as the kids are alright and baba o riley by the who after concluding the binaural tour the band released touring band 2000

pearl jam commenced work on a new album following a year long break after its full scale tour in support binaural mccready described the recording environment as a pretty positive one and very intense and spiritual regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written vedder said there s been a lot of mortality it s a weird time to be writing roskilde changed the shape of us as people and our filter for seeing the world changed pearl jam released its seventh album riot act on november 12 2002 it included the singles i am mine and save you the album featured a much more folk based and experimental sound evident in the presence of b3 organist boom gaspar on songs such as love boat captain stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic said riot act is the album that pearl jam has been wanting to make since vitalogy  a muscular art rock record one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours the track entitled arc was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine

too pearl jam did not re sign its deal with j records and sources state that the band is likely to self release the album the band has tentative plans to embark on a small tour later this year around the release of the album compared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s pearl jam s style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s pearl jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences including the who neil young and the ramones pearl jam s success has been attributed to its sound which fuses the riff heavy stadium rock of the 70s with the grit and anger of 80s post punk without ever neglecting hooks and choruses pearl jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases by 1994 s vitalogy the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music the band s 1996 album no code was a deliberate break from the musical style of ten the songs on the album featured elements of garage rock worldbeat and experimentalism after 1998 s yield which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band s early work the band dabbled with experimental art rock on 2000 s binaural and folk rock elements on 2002 s riot act the band s latest album 2006 s pearl jam was cited as a return to the band s early sound critic jim derogatis describes vedder s vocals as a jim morrison like vocal growl vedder s lyrical topics range from personal to social and political concerns his lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom individualism and sympathy for troubled individuals when the band started gossard and mccready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists respectively the dynamic began to change when vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the vitalogy era mccready said in 2006 even though there are three guitars i think there s maybe more room now stone will pull back and play a two note line and ed will do a power chord thing and i fit into all that while nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s pearl jam quickly outsold them and became not only the most popular alternative rock band but the most popular american rock band of the decade pearl jam has been described as modern rock radio s most influential stylists the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like alive and even flow just melodic enough to get moshers singing along the band inspired and influenced a number of bands ranging from silverchair to puddle of mudd and the strokes pearl jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries in the grunge scene like nirvana and soundgarden and also bands it has influenced such as creed pearl jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in music critic jim derogatis said in the aftermath of the band s battle with ticketmaster that it proved that a rock band which isn t comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime it indicated that idealism in rock n roll is not the sole province of those 60s bands enshrined in the rock and roll hall of fame eric weisbard of spin said in 2001 the group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists in a 2005 usa today reader s poll pearl jam was voted the greatest american rock band of all time in april 2006 pearl jam was awarded the prize for best live act in esquire s esky music awards the blurb called pearl jam the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last pearl jam s fanbase following has been compared to that of the grateful dead s with rolling stone magazine stating that pearl jam toured incessantly and became one of rock s great arena acts attracting a fanatical grateful dead like cult following with marathon true believer shows in the vanishing spirit of bruce springsteen the who and u2 when asked about pearl jam s legacy in a 2000 interview vedder said i think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in that was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it the goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this the answers weren t always easy but i think we found a way throughout its career pearl jam has promoted wider social and political issues from pro choice sentiments to opposition to george w bush s presidency vedder acts as the band s spokesman on these issues the band has promoted an array of causes including awareness of crohn s disease which lead guitarist mike mccready suffers from ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection among others guitarist stone gossard has been active in environmental pursuits and has been an advocate of pearl jam s carbon neutral policy offsetting the band s environmental impact vedder has advocated for the release of the west memphis 3 for years and damien echols a member of the three shares a writing credit for the song army reserve the band publicizes such causes via its official website and includes links to alternative news sources the band and especially frontman eddie vedder have been vocal supporters of the pro choice movement in 1992 spin printed an article by vedder entitled reclamation that detailed his views on abortion in an mtv unplugged concert the same year vedder stood on a stool and wrote pro choice on his arm in protest when the band performed the song porch the band are members of a number of pro choice organizations including choice usa and voters for choice as members of rock the vote and vote for change the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in united states elections vedder was outspoken in support of green party presidential

showcasing the vote for change tour s performers vedder told the magazine i supported ralph nader in 2000 but it s a time of crisis we have to get a new administration in vedder usually comments on politics between songs often to criticize u s foreign policy and a number of his songs including bu hleaguer and world wide suicide are openly critical of the bush administration at lollapalooza 2007 vedder spoke out against bp amoco dumping effluent in lake michigan at the end of daughter he sang the lyrics george bush leave this world alone george bush find yourself another home in the beginning of the second encore vedder invited iraq war veteran tomas young the subject of the documentary body of war onto the stage to urge an end to the war young in turn introduced ben harper who contributed vocals to no more and rockin in the free world the band has since discovered that some of the bush related lyrics were excised from the at t webcast of the event and are questioning whether that constitutes censorship at t later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor davie brown entertainment pearl jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities for example the band headlined a seattle concert in 2001 to support the united nations efforts to combat world hunger the band added a date at the chicago house of blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of

known worldwide although their origin in mexico is not clear to the non mexican listener bésame mucho granada cielito lindo el rey la bamba maria bonita and many more are part of the mexican culture and famous all over the world the son jarocho and son huasteco were influenced by the son cubano cha cha cha danzon mambo and bolero grew importantly in mexico especially in veracruz and mexico city important song writers that influenced this were perez prado benny more and agustin lara rancheras are interpreted by mariachi bands examples include the work of cuco sanchez chavela vargas and vicente fernández mariachi music is an emblem of mexico s cultural traditions another important music style is musica norteña or northern style tunes which has been the basis for such sub genres as musica de banda musica norteña like musica tejana arose in the 1830 s and 40 s in the rio grande region in the southern texas influenced by both bohemian music and immigrant miners its rhythm was derived from european polkas which were popular during the 1800 s musica de banda which is stylistically similar to musica norteña originated in the state of sinaloa during the 1960s there are other new styles such as cumbia mexican pop and mexican rock the mexican rock movement began in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s rapidly becoming popular and peaking in the 80 s and 90 s with real authentic sounds and styles mexican rock combined the traditional instruments and stories of mexico in its songs mexican along with latin american rock remain very popular in mexico surpassing other cultural interpretations of rock and roll there are other popular music genres which have made their way into mexico cumbia mexican pop hip hop and rock just to name a few these music genres made there way from the u s latin america and europe and are increasingly becoming popular among mexican youths mexico s stronghold on the music market in latin america has long been established the mexican music

the last of whom arrived in mexico in 1994 released a second album there and started a successful career in the united states after that according to the america top 100 mexico had over 90 hits in latin america during 2006 almost a third more than its closest competitor the united states today there are many modern mexican musical genres widely popular country music includes norteño banda and duranguense bands which play rancheras corridos as well as cumbia rock en español hip hop and electronic music are other modern genres popular among mexicans with a wide variety of mexican artists in the early 1900 s many people of german descent settled in texas and influenced a new breed of mexican music now called tejano or texmex bands began incorporating the german polka rhythm and the german diatonic accordion in what was labeled as conjunto a 4 piece band made up of bass drums accordion and guitar later artists began incorporating different rhythms like r b pop blues and synthesizers into the music it was now being called tejano or texmex nowadays texmex can refer to either tejano or conjunto and to your average tejano fan no distinction is drawn between the two styles while being influenced by different rhythms the diatonic accordion still remains the main staple of tejano music which gives it its unique sound distinct from the regular piano key accordion used to play norteño music to listen to tejano music visit texmex fm comtexmex music has evolved into tech mex genre of music blending traditional mexican cumbia norteño ranchera and mariachi blended with techno rhythms and synthesizers this brand of music was made popular by djs in dance clubs and bands like los big sexy and nortec collective banda music was created with the imitation of military bands that were imported during the reign of emperor maximillian in the 1800s banda sounds very similar to polka music polish immigrants established themselves in the state of sinaloa it was further popularized during the mexican revolution when local authorities and states formed their own bands to play in the town squares revolutionary leaders such as pancho villa also took wind bands with them wherever they went banda has to this day remained popular throughout the central and northern states it has however diversified into different styles due to regions instruments and modernization today people associate banda with sinaloense this originated in the 1940s when the media distributed banda el recodo repertoire as exclusively from sinaloa when it was actually regional music from all over mexico although banda music is played by many bands from different parts of mexico its original roots are in sinaloa and zacatecas which are hugely famous for bands such as banda el recodo from sinaloa and banda jerez from zacatecas banda sinaloense experienced international popularity in the 1990s the most prominent band was banda el recodo which is renowned as the mother of all bands unlike tamborazo zacatecano sinaloense s essential instrument is the tuba sometimes an accordion is also included well known artists include tamborazo zacatecano originated in the state of zacatecas and translates to drum beat from zacatecas this banda style is traditionally composed of 2 trumpets 2 clarinets a saxophone a trombone and the essential bass drum la marcha de zacatecas is a perfect example of this type of music rumba came from the black mexican slaves in veracruz mexico city and yucatán the style began in cuba and later became famous in the black community of mexico these songs are popular in the south of mexico electeña came from the the growing popularity of norteña and electronic music in the united states southwest during the early 2000 s it incoporates elements of mexican musical styles such as norteña cumbia and latin rock with usually a electronic dance beat made popular by local celebrities james gribbin and matthew burke of tucson arizona gruperas are the mixed sound of rumba and ranchera music mostly heard in the mid south of mexico this music contains both rumba rhythms and ranchera rhythms which these are mostly heard at parties clubs and mexican radio muzzaac mexican reggae first started in the caribbean sea of mexico by jamaican immigrants after hearing this type of music they started to invent their own reggae in spanish the european influence on cuba s later musical development is most influentially represented by danzón which is an elegant dance that became established in cuba before being exported to popular acclaim throughout latin america especially mexico its roots lay in european social dances like the english country dance french contredanse and spanish contradanza danzon developed in the 1870s in the region of matanzas where

afterwards and mangum was joined by schneider who contributed production and instrumentation neutral milk hotel released in the aeroplane over the sea in 1998 which became their most well known and critically acclaimed album although the album did not meet commercial success at the time of release it has gone on to sell over 100 000 copies and was selected as the fourth best album of the nineties by pitchfork despite growing popularity the group disbanded in 1999 after mangum became disenchanted with touring and the music press later having a nervous breakdown neutral milk hotel was a part of the elephant 6 recording company based in athens georgia the band was one elephant 6 s three first projects alongside the apples in stereo and olivia tremor control jeff mangum along with high school friends will cullen hart and bill doss formed the olivia tremor control with mangum appearing on their first release the california demise 7 prior to recording for friends under the nmh moniker mangum recorded a few cassettes under the name milk the most well known of these tapes was called pygmie barn in e minor these are the earliest known recordings that mangum initiated and executed himself there were only an estimated dozen or so copies ever made of this tape none of which has been made public it was revealed circa 2006 on the elephant 6 online forums that another tape under said name entitled beauty was released along with several recordings under the name rubby bulbs neutral milk hotel began simply as a recording project for mangum in the early 1990s he produced several demo cassettes among them 1991 s invent yourself a shortcake 1992 s beauty and 1993 s hype city soundtrack along with two more from this period seemingly unnamed although easily found on the internet these demos capture the project at a very embryonic stage songs are played in between various sound collages and tape experiments one of which consists only of a six minute conversation between mangum and hart another track digestion machine features a varied collage of voices answering the question asked by mangum what does the digestion machine mean to you the more accessible synthetic flying machine also titled up and over later became the king of carrot flowers pt 3 on in the aeroplane over the sea during this period mangum was wandering the country staying in the closets of friends and in a state of perpetual unemployment it was in these circumstances that the band s first formal releases took shape strictly speaking however the band usually consisted of mangum and whoever else was present at the time this is obvious on neutral milk hotel s first release a 7 record entitled everything is recorded when mangum was spending time in seattle washington released on cher doll records in 1994 a full album on avery island followed this time recorded mainly in denver colorado where mangum was backed by robert schneider of the apples in stereo rick benjamin of the perry weissman 3 and lisa janssen of secret square it was released by merge records in 1996 after the release of avery island neutral milk hotel became a fully fledged band as julian koster scott spillane and jeremy barnes joined mangum the band now being based in new york soon after this they moved to athens ga where many of mangum s friends had begun to settle and the elephant 6 recording company began to fully take shape after this the band went back to denver to record a proper follow up to on avery island the band s second lp in the aeroplane over the sea released in 1998 is notable as a critically acclaimed work and a widely popular recording it is a spiritually motivated work conceptually based on the beauty to be found in the horrific fate of anne frank during live performances including the one released under the title live at jittery joe s mangum has described some of the songs off this album as based on urgent recurring dreams he had of a jewish family during world war ii the album was highly praised by critics for its wildly inventive instrumentation and mangum s provocative and impassioned lyrics although it met with scant response from the general public when it was released the recording has continued to gain momentum in indie music circles selling well over 100 000 copies according to merge records however the record took its toll on mangum the band abruptly went on hiatus turning down all requests for shows including a support slot for r e m before neutral milk hotel began their indefinite hiatus mangum played live at a house show on december 5 1998 in athens on chris bilheimer s birthday the bill was shared with elf power and the audience was made up almost completely of friends and bandmates playing solo and acoustic mangum opened the set with what was to be the only post aeroplane composition to be performed in public little birds he explained to the audience that the song is about a boy whose body becomes filled up with miniature birds that come out of the bathtub faucet and protect him from his murderous father mangum finished the rest of the evening with most of the aeroplane songs encouraging the audience to sing along in substitute for the horn parts for the last several songs scott spillane took his trumpet in to an adjacent room and played his parts through the wall a recording of the show circulated on the internet but it has never been officially released most likely due to the poor quality of the recording mangum played another show on december 31 1998 at which he performed the songs oh sister engine and in the aeroplane over the sea joined by koster and spillane although some of the members are occasionally active with one another in other projects it is unknown whether any more neutral milk hotel albums will be released when asked in an interview if he intends to write another album mangum said i don t know it would be nice but sometimes i kind of doubt it there were plans to release a neutral milk hotel rarities album on the orange twin label its cancellation was subsequently announced in 2005 on the orange twin website stating that jeff mangum decided against the project there has however been some activity since aeroplane first orange twin re released everything is complete with extra bonus tracks as well as live at jittery joe s a live recording by filmmaker lance bangs of a show mangum played in a coffee house in athens georgia in 1997 the major organ and the adding machine album a rather secretive project released by orange twin in 2001 and consisting mainly of experimental musical collage features

of orange twin field works volume i mangum s field recording of a bulgarian folk festival also on orange twin in 2001 additionally he plays drums on the first circulatory system album since the breakup of neutral milk hotel jeff mangum has only played live proper again once at the kings arms pub in auckland new zealand at the request of the tall dwarfs s chris knox the band was billed as the world of wild beards incorporated although when he explains this bizarre name during the course of the show mangum gives a small speech about an obscure seemingly fictional company existing in the early 1900s named walking wall of beards incorporated the show consisted of acts from mangum laura carter and chris knox mangum played 13 songs about half of them from aeroplane and covered phil spector s i love how you love me and john lennon s mother with chris knox joining him on the latter a recording of the show exists but it has never been officially released mangum has also made occasional appearances with elf power and the instruments and came onstage at the first of the olivia tremor control s new york shows on their 2005 reunion tours to sing briefly further releases from neutral milk hotel however are indicated to be unlikely the other members are all still releasing material julian koster as the music tapes scott spillane as the gerbils and jeremy barnes as a hawk and a hacksaw bablicon and marta tennae in 2005 in the aeroplane over the sea was re released by domino records in the uk in a sleeve featuring praise from among others franz ferdinand and arcade fire bands very much influenced by nmh mangum has also done a few small art projects following a charity auction on ebay of an acoustic guitar decorated by mangum himself more guitars hand decorated by mangum were sold via orange twin records for 900 apiece also a number of his original drawings this time costing only 10 each were sold via neutral milk hotel s website in 2006 a message was posted on the elephant 6 message board purportedly from jeff mangum suggesting that mangum would record and tour again though it was unclear if it would be under the neutral milk hotel moniker or another one it soon caused an enormous stir within the indie community and news of the message appeared in rolling stone pitchfork media and billboard however it was eventually discredited by robert schneider of the apples in stereo a close friend of mangum s the perpetrator of the hoax is still unknown in october 2008 mangum made appearances during the elephant 6 holiday surprise tour he played engine with julian koster at the pittsburgh and columbus shows this was the first time since the world of wild beards incorporated show that mangum had publicly played a neutral milk hotel song

phonograph in france and thomas alva edison invented the phonograph cylinder the first device to play back recorded sound in the united states in 1892 emile berliner began commercial production of his

transmitter while a student at herrold college of engineering and wireless located in san jose california under the authority of radio pioneer charles doc herrold we used popular records at that time mainly caruso records because they were very good and loud we needed a boost we started on an experimental basis and then because this is novel we stayed on schedule continually without leaving the air at any time from that time on except for a very short time during world war i when the government required us to remove the antenna most of our programming was records i ll admit but of course we gave out news as we could obtain it by 1910 regular radio broadcasting had started to use live as well as prerecorded sound in the early radio age content typically included comedy drama news music and sports reporting the on air announcers and programmers would later be known as disc jockeys in the 1920s juke joints became popular as places for dancing and drinking to recorded jukebox music in

go go nightclub opened in paris france considered to be the world s first discothèque or disco discos began appearing across europe and the united states from the late 1940s to early 1950s the introduction of television eroded the popularity of radio s early format causing it to take on the general form it has today with a strong focus on music news and sports in the 1950s american radio djs would appear live at sock hops and platter parties and assume the role of a human jukebox they would usually play 45 rpm records featuring hit singles on one turntable while talking between songs in some cases a live drummer was hired to play beats between songs to maintain the dance floor in 1955 bob casey a well known sock hop dj introduced the first two turntable system for alternating back and forth between records creating a continuous playback of music throughout the 1950s payola payments by record companies to djs in return for airplay were an ongoing problem part of the fallout from the payola scandal was tighter control of the music by station management the top 40 format emerged where popular songs are played repeatedly in the late 1950s sound systems a new form of public entertainment were developed in the ghettos of kingston jamaica promoters who called themselves djs would throw large parties in the streets that centered on the disc jockey called the selector who played dance music from large loud pa systems and bantered over the music with a boastful rhythmic chanting style called toasting these parties quickly became profitable for the promoters who would

sanctuary nightclub beatmatching is the technique of creating seamless transitions between records with matching beats or tempos grasso also developed slip cuing the technique of holding a record still while the turntable is revolving underneath releasing it at the desired moment to create a sudden transition from the previous record by 1968 the number of dance clubs started to decline most american clubs either closed or were transformed into clubs featuring live bands neighborhood block parties that were modelled after jamaican sound systems gained popularity in europe and in the boroughs of new york city during the early 1970s the economic downturn led most of the dance clubs to become underground gay discos in 1973 jamaican born dj kool herc widely regarded as the godfather of hip hop culture performed at block parties in his bronx neighborhood and developed a technique of mixing back and forth between two identical records to extend the rhythmic instrumental segment or break turntablism the art of using turntables not only to play music but to manipulate sound and create original music began to develop in 1974 technics released the first sl 1200 turntable which

takes up the entire first side of that lp years later kraftwerk would become a significant influence on hip hop artists such as afrika bambaataa and house music pioneer frankie knuckles during the mid

songs listed by beats per minute as well as by either artist or song title billboard ran an article on the new publication and it went national relatively quickly the list made it easier for beginning

melded electronic hip hop beats with the melody from kraftwerk s trans europe express in 1982 the compact disc reached the public market in asia and early the following year in other markets this event is often seen as the big bang of the digital audio revolution in the early 1980s nyc disco dj larry levan known for his eclectic mixes gained a cult following and the paradise garage the nightclub at which he spun became the prototype for the modern dance club where the music and the dj were showcased around the same time the disco influenced electronic style of dance music called house music emerged in chicago the name was derived from the warehouse club in chicago where resident dj frankie knuckles mixed old disco classics and eurosynth pop house music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats the common element of most house music is a 4 4 beat generated by a drum machine or other electronic means together with a solid synth bassline in 1983 jesse saunders released what some consider the first house music track on on the mid 1980s also saw the emergence of new york garage a house music hybrid that was inspired by levan s style and sometimes eschewed the accentuated high hats of the chicago house sound during the mid 1980s techno music emerged from the detroit club scene being geographically located between chicago and new york detroit techno artists combined elements of chicago house and new york garage along with european imports techno distanced itself from disco s roots by becoming almost purely electronic with synthesized beats

toward the professional mobile and club dj starting in the mid 1980s the wedding and banquet business changed dramatically with the introduction of dj music replacing the bands that had been the norm bandleaders like jerry perell and others started dj companies such as ny rhythm dj entertainers using their knowledge of audience participation mc charisma and crowd pleasing repertory selection the wedding music industry became almost all dj while combining the class and elegance of the traditional band presentation new djs as well as bandleaders with years of experience and professionalism transformed the entire industry during the early 1990s the rave scene built on the acid house scene the rave scene changed dance music the image of djs and the nature of promoting the innovative marketing surrounding the rave scene created the first superstar djs who established marketable brands around their names and sound some of these celebrity djs toured around the world and were able to branch out into other music related activities during the early 1990s the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity but gramophone records continued to be made into the 21st century particularly for club djs and for local acts recording on small regional labels during the mid 1990s trance music having run rampant in the german underground for several years emerged as a major force in dance music throughout europe and the uk it became one of the world s most dominant forms dance music by the end of the 1990s thanks to a trend away from its repetitive hypnotic roots and

music of independent bands in 1996 mobile beat had its first national mobile dj convention in las vegas during the late 1990s nu metal bands such as korn limp bizkit and linkin park reached the height of their popularity this new subgenre of alternative rock bore some influence from hip hop because rhythmic innovation and syncopation are primary often featuring djs as band members as well during the late 1990s various dj and vj software programs were developed allowing personal computer users to deejay or veejay using his or her personal music or video files in 1998 the first mp3 digital audio player was released the eiger labs mpman f10 final scratch debuted at the be developer conference marking the first digital dj system to allow djs control of mp3 files through special time coded

joined with computer djing pioneers to offer professional endorsements the first being professor jam who went on to develop the industry s first dedicated computer dj convention and learning program the cps dj summit to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology in 1999 shawn fanning released napster the first of the massively popular peer to peer file sharing systems during this period the avla of canada announced an mp3 djing license administered by the canadian recording industry association this meant that djs could apply for a license giving them the right to perform publicly using music stored on a hard drive instead of having to cart their whole cd collections around to their gigs by the 2000s new technologies such as voice tracking allowed single djs to send announcements across many stations commercial radio djs were increasingly limited in their freedom to select which songs to play some music aficionados sought freeform stations that put the djs back in control or chose instead to listen to satellite radio services or portable music players college radio stations and other public radio outlets continued to be the most common places for freeform play lists in the u s in the late 90s and early 00s the convenience and popularity of the mp3 and the increasing power of laptops spawned a new type of dj the mp3j in 2004 serato introduced its own version of the digital vinyl dj system serato scratch live making improvements in overall system stability and more closely emulating the feel of true vinyl rane has since licensed the software as well as collaborated with serato to bring out a hardware mixer version in 2006 soon afterward many nightclub deejays that had remained true vinyl record aficionados began the transition to becoming digital vinyl users in 2006 the concept of dj had its 100 year anniversary in the late 2000s topless female djs have appeared in special nightclubs primarily in finland and russia 
numbers stations are shortwave radio stations of uncertain origin they generally broadcast artificially generated voices reading streams of numbers words letters tunes or morse code they are in a wide variety of languages and the voices are usually women s though sometimes men s or children s voices are used evidence supports popular assumptions that the broadcasts are used to send messages to spies this usage has not been publicly acknowledged by any government that may operate a numbers station but in one case cuban numbers station espionage has been publicly prosecuted in a united states federal court numbers stations appear and disappear over time and their overall activity has increased slightly since the early 1990s this increase suggests that as spy related phenomena they were not unique to the cold war according to the notes of the conet project numbers stations have been reported since world war i if accurate this would make numbers stations among the earliest radio broadcasts it has long been speculated and was argued in court in one case that these stations operate as a simple and foolproof method for government agencies to communicate with spies working undercover according to this theory the messages are encrypted with a one time pad to avoid any risk of decryption by the enemy as evidence numbers stations have changed details of their broadcasts or produced special nonscheduled broadcasts coincident with extraordinary political events such as the august coup number stations are also acknowledged for espionage purposes in robert wallace and h keith melton s spycraft the one way voice link described a covert communications system that transmitted messages to an agent s unmodified shortwave radio using the high frequency shortwave bands between 3 and 30 mhz at a predetermined time date and frequency contained in their communications plan the transmissions were contained in a series of repeated random number sequences and could only be deciphered using the agent s one time pad if proper tradecraft was practiced and instructions were precisely followed an owvl transmission was considered unbreakable as long as the agent s cover could justify possessing a shortwave radio and he was not under technical surveillance high frequency owvl was a secure and preferred system for the cia during the cold war others speculate that some of these stations may be related to illegal drug smuggling operations unlike government stations smugglers stations would need to be lower powered and irregularly operated to avoid location by triangulated direction finding followed by government raids however numbers stations have transmitted with impunity for decades so they are generally presumed to be operated or sponsored only by governments also numbers station transmissions in the international shortwave bands typically require high levels of electric power that is unavailable to ranches farms or plantations in isolated drug growing regions high frequency radio signals transmitted at relatively low power can travel around the world under ideal propagation conditions which are affected by local rf noise levels weather season and sunspots and can then be received with a properly tuned antenna of adequate size and a superb receiver however spies often have to work only with available hand held receivers sometimes under difficult local conditions and in all seasons and sunspot cycles only very large transmitters perhaps up to 500 000 watts are guaranteed to get through to nearly any basement dwelling spy nearly any place on earth nearly all of the time some governments may not need a numbers station with global coverage if they only send spies to nearby countries although no broadcaster or government has acknowledged transmitting the numbers a 1998 article in the daily telegraph quoted a spokesperson for the department of trade and industry as saying these are what you suppose they are people shouldn t be mystified by them they are not for shall we say public consumption it is believed that listening to numbers stations without permission in the uk is illegal under section 48 of the wireless telegraphy act 2006 numbers stations are often given nicknames by enthusiasts often reflecting some distinctive element of the station such as their interval signal for example the lincolnshire poacher formerly one of the best known numbers stations played the first two bars of the folk song the lincolnshire poacher before each string of numbers magnetic fields plays music from french electronic musician jean michel jarre before and after each set of numbers the atención station begins its transmission with the spanish word atención although it is time consuming and may require costly global travel to pinpoint the source of a radio transmission in the shortwave band errors at the transmission site radio direction finding and a knowledge of shortwave radio propagation have provided armchair detectives clues to some number station locations for example the atención station was originally presumed to be from cuba as a supposed error allowed radio habana cuba to be carried on the frequency whether the frequency of radio habana cuba and the frequency of the atención station merely interfered with each other or whether the operator of the station was listening to the radio and it accidentally ended up on the air is unclear circa 2000 2001 the united states has officially identified atención as cuban also several articles in the radio magazine popular communications published in the 1980s and early 1990s described hobbyists using portable radio direction finding equipment to locate numbers stations in florida and in the warrenton virginia area from the outside they spotted the station s antenna inside a military facility the station hunter speculated that the antenna s transmitter at the facility was connected by a telephone wire pair to a source of spoken numbers in the washington d c area the author said the federal communications commission would not comment on public inquiries about american territory numbers stations on some stations tones can be heard in the background it has been suggested that in such cases the voice may be an aid to tuning to the correct frequency with the coded message being sent by modulating the tones perhaps using a technology such as burst transmission the use of number stations as a method of espionage is discussed in spycraft the only item penkovsky used that could properly be called advanced tradecraft was his agent receive communications through a one way voice link these encoded messages known as owvl were broadcast over shortwave frequencies at predetermined times from a cia operated transmitter in western europe penkovsky listened to these messages on a panasonic radio strings of numbers read in a dispassionate voice and then decoded them using a one time pad atención of cuba became the world s first numbers station to be officially and publicly accused of transmitting to spies it was the centerpiece of a united states federal court espionage trial following the arrest of the wasp network of cuban spies in 1998 the u s prosecutors claimed the accused were writing down number codes received from atención using sony hand held shortwave receivers and typing the numbers into laptop computers to decode spying instructions the fbi testified that they had entered a spy s apartment in 1995 and copied the computer decryption program for the atención numbers code they used it to decode atención spy messages which the prosecutors unveiled in court united states government evidence included the following three examples of decoded atención messages at the rate of one spoken number per character per second each of these sentences takes a minute or more to transmit the moderator of an e mail list for global numbers station hobbyists claimed someone on the spooks list had already cracked the code for a repeated transmission if it was received garbled such code breaking is possible if a one time pad decoding key is used more than once generally numbers stations follow a basic format although there are many differences in details between stations transmissions usually begin on the hour or half hour the prelude or introduction of a transmission includes some kind of identifier either for the station itself and or for the intended recipient this can take the form of numeric or radio alphabet code names characteristic phrases and sometimes musical or electronic sounds sometimes as in the case of the israeli radio alphabet stations the prelude can also signify the nature or priority of the message to follow charlie india oscar 2 indicating that no message follows often the prelude repeats for a period before the body of the message begins there is usually an announcement of the number of number groups in the message then the groups are recited groups are usually either four or five digits or radio alphabet letters the groups are typically repeated either by reading each group twice or by repeating the entire message as a whole some stations send more than one message during a transmission in this case some or all of the above process is repeated with different contents finally after all the messages have been sent the station will sign off in some characteristic fashion usually it will simply be some form of the word end in whatever language the station uses some stations especially those thought to originate from the former soviet union end with a series of zeros e g 000 000 others end with music or other sundry sounds due to the secretive nature of the messages the cryptographic function employed by particular stations is not publicly known except in one or possibly two cases it is assumed that most stations use a one time pad that would make the contents of these number groups indistinguishable from randomly generated numbers or digits in the definitely known case the former state of west germany did use a one time pad for numbers transmissions although few numbers stations have been tracked down by location the technology used to transmit the numbers has historically been clear stock shortwave transmitters using powers from 10 kw to 100 kw amplitude modulated transmitters with optionally variable frequency using class c power output stages with plate modulation are the workhorses of international shortwave broadcasting including numbers stations application of spectrum analysis to number station signals has revealed the presence of data bursts rtty modulated subcarriers phase shifted carriers and other unusual transmitter modulations like polytones the frequently reported use of high tech modulations like data bursts in combination or sequence with spoken numbers suggest transmissions for differing intelligence operations for spies in the field low tech spoken number transmissions continue to have advantages in the 21st century high tech data receiving equipment is difficult to obtain and being caught with more than a civilian shortwave news radio could be construed as evidence of spying yet governments embassies aircraft and ships at sea are known to possess complex receiving equipment that could make regular use of encrypted data transmissions from the home country these probably include charts and photos that require more transmitted data than can be sent efficiently using spoken numbers the north korean propaganda station voice of korea began to broadcast on the lincolnshire poacher s former frequency 11545 khz in 2006 possibly to deliberately interfere with its propagation this clash can be viewed in video format the apparent target zone for the lincolnshire poacher signals originating in cyprus was the middle east not the far east which is covered by its sister station cherry ripe on 27 september 2006 amateur radio transmissions in the 30 m band were affected by the e7 russian man number station at 1740 utc the interference can be heard here the late havana moon reported in his own publication the numbers factsheet in october 1990 that one particularly dangerous station has been interfering with air to ground traffic on 6577 khz a frequency allocated to international aeronautical communications in the busy caribbean sector on at least one monitored transmission the air traffic controller at arinc moved the pilot to an alternate frequency as the numbers transmission was totally blocking the frequency from effective use a station operated by the west german bnd agency whose callsign was hotel kilo used to transmit on 9450 khz interfering with radio moscow which used the same frequency a tape recording of the interference was submitted to radio moscow which prompted this response sw radio africa transmits from meyerton south africa on 4880 khz and is the independent voice of zimbabwe a video of the mossad e10 station uniform lima x ray interfering with the african station the religious station wyfr transmits from okeechobee florida usa on 6855 khz it is regularly affected by the cuban spanish number station v2 a video shows the v2 interfering with the american station a bbc frequency 7325 khz has also been used this prompted a letter to the bbc from a listener in andorra she wrote to the world service waveguide program complaining that her listening had been spoiled by a female voice reading out numbers in english and she asked the announcer what this interference was the bbc presenter laughed at the suggestion of spy activity he had consulted the experts at bush house who declared that the voice was reading out nothing more sinister than snowfall figures for the ski slopes near the listener s home with more research into this case short wave enthusiasts are fairly sure that this was a numbers station being broadcast on a random frequency the likelihood of the broadcast being snow readings is in doubt because it would have been illegal to broadcast on an already used frequency radio ukraine international uses 9950 khz in the 31 metre band at 1610 utc on thursday 22 november 2007 the powerful s06 russian number station transmitted a call up of 425 you can see a video of this radio mediterranee int transmits on 9575 khz from nador morocco on 11 september 2008 the english language number station e11a sent a message on 9576 khz which was hidden in the upper sideband of the moroccan station you can view the interference caused in this video clip numbers station transmissions have often been the target of jamming attempts despite this targeting many number stations continue to broadcast unhindered several theories exist that aid in explaining the inability to effectively jam the transmissions with only a finite number of jamming transmitters available at any given time it may be more efficient to block clandestine stations intended for a large audience rather than a message intended for a single person another theory is that there may be a gentlemen s agreement in place i e we won t jam yours if you don t jam ours in addition the haphazard nature of some stations e g not having a fixed schedule or frequency also makes jamming more difficult because the broadcast may go undetected historical examples of jamming although most number stations have various nicknames which usually describe some aspect of the station itself the enigma 2000 number stations monitoring group has assigned a code to each known station this takes the form of a letter followed by a number the letter indicates the language used by the station in question for example the well known defunct lincolnshire poacher station has the designation e3 the cuban atencion station has designation v2 the most recent station to be given a designation is e27 which was a station heard broadcasting on several occasions in late 2006 and early 2007 some stations have also been stripped of their designation if they are discovered not to be a numbers station this was the case for e22 which was discovered in 2005 to be test transmissions for all india radio the west german film der westen leuchtet shows an

 powerhouse is a 1937 instrumental musical composition by raymond scott probably best known today as the iconic assembly line music in warner bros animated cartoons in posterity it is by far the most famous of scott s compositions but in its time it wasn t as popular as his the toy trumpet nor as frequently recorded by other artists as twilight in turkey in scripted comments read on the first anniversary special of cbs radio s saturday night swing club on which the raymond scott quintette performed announcer paul douglas indicates that powerhouse was first premiered on that program sometime in january or early february 1937 scott s quintette first recorded powerhouse in new york on february 20 1937 along with three other titles it was first commercially released on the irving mills owned master records label as master 111 and coupled with another scott composition the toy trumpet it was later reissued in the 78 era on brunswick 7993 and columbia 36311 with the same take issued on all releases both titles remained in scott s repertoire for decades both were adapted in warner brothers cartoons by wb music director carl stalling along with a dozen other scott titles and both have been recorded by numerous other artists stalling who spiced his scores with powerhouse dozens of times never created a complete version of the work his adaptations exist as truncated quotations the united states publisher of the title is music sales corporation outside the u s the title is controlled by warner chappell music structurally powerhouse consists of two distinct and seemingly unrelated musical themes played at different tempos both have been used in numerous cartoons the first theme sometimes referred to as powerhouse a is a frantic passage typically employed in chase and high speed vehicle scenes to imply whirlwind velocity the slower theme powerhouse b is the assembly line music which sometimes accompanies scenes of repetitive mechanical activity powerhouse in its entirety places b in the center while a opens and closes the work in the sequence a b a the first use of powerhouse in a cartoon occurred in the 1943 warner bros looney tunes short porky pig s feat directed by frank tashlin it was subsequently featured in over 40 other warner bros cartoons the most well known assembly line usage of powerhouse b occurs in bob clampett s baby bottleneck in which newborn babies are processed on a conveyor belt in time to the melody the warner brothers merrie melodies cartoon duck dodgers in the 24½th century contains stalling s lengthiest adaptation of the powerhouse a section clocking in at one minute and twenty five seconds the original raymond scott quintette recordings including powerhouse were licensed in the early 1990s for use in soundtracks on the ren and stimpy show and can be heard in twelve episodes various passages of the tune have been arranged for use in the simpsons duckman the bernie mac show and the drew carey show an entire 1993 episode of animaniacs toy shop terror was set to warner bros music director richard stone s arrangement of the composition powerhouse also served as bumper theme music for the cartoon network from 1997 to 2002 and can be heard as a systematic rock theme in the 2004 feature film looney tunes back in action powerhouse was adapted without attribution by composer james horner in the soundtrack of the 1989 film honey i shrunk the kids the horner composition titled power play resulted in legal action by scott s u s publisher music sales corporation against walt disney pictures for failure to credit the work s original composer the dispute was ultimately settled out of court in recent years powerhouse has been recorded by jazz clarinetist don byron on his album bug music pedal steel guitarist jon rauhouse the metropole orchestra the beau hunks sextette the coctails and jazz guitarist skip heller the title as arranged by michelle dibucci has been in the repertoire of kronos quartet since 1994 the rock band rush adapted part of powerhouse in their 1978 song la villa strangiato on their hemispheres album as did soul coughing in their song bus to beelzebub from the album ruby vroom the tune has also been appropriated by they might be giants devo and others other contemporary artists who have recorded versions of powerhouse include thelonious moog the tiptons the grammy nominated string ensemble quartet san francisco and steroid maximus in 2006 2007 the assembly line theme was used in a highly choreographed commercial for the visa check card the commercial entitled lunch was staged in a manner intended to be reminiscent of the song s cartoon uses 
soundgarden was an american rock band formed in seattle washington in 1984 by lead singer and drummer chris cornell lead guitarist kim thayil and bassist hiro yamamoto matt cameron became the band s permanent drummer in 1986 while bassist ben shepherd became a permanent replacement for yamamoto in 1990 soundgarden was one of the key bands in the creation of grunge a style of alternative rock that developed in seattle and was based around the band s record label sub pop soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label though the band did not achieve commercial success until seattle contemporaries nirvana and pearl jam popularized grunge in the early 1990s soundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album superunknown which debuted at number one on the billboard charts and yielded the grammy award winning singles black hole sun and spoonman in 1997 the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction soundgarden has sold eight million records in the u s and an estimated twenty million albums worldwide soundgarden was formed in 1984 by chris cornell and hiro yamamoto they were later joined by kim thayil thayil had moved to seattle from park forest illinois with yamamoto and bruce pavitt who would later start sub pop records the band named themselves after a wind channeling pipe sculpture a sound garden located on noaa property next to magnuson park seattle washington cornell originally played drums while singing but in 1985 the band enlisted scott sundquist to allow cornell to concentrate on vocals the band traveled around playing various concerts with this line up for about a year the band s first recordings were three songs that appeared on a 1986 compilation for c z records called deep six it also featured songs by fellow grunge pioneers green river skin yard malfunkshun the u men and the melvins kathleen c fennessy of allmusic stated that the compilation documents a formative period in northwest rock history in 1986 sundquist left the band to spend time with his family and was replaced by matt cameron who was the drummer for skin yard kcmu dj jonathan poneman was impressed after seeing soundgarden perform one night later saying i saw this band that was everything rock music should be poneman offered to fund a release by the band so thayil told him to team up with bruce pavitt poneman offered to contribute 20 000 in funding for sub pop effectively turning it into a full fledged record label soundgarden signed to sub pop and the label released hunted down in 1987 as the band s first single the b side of the hunted down single nothing to say appeared on the kcmu compilation tape bands that will make money which was distributed to record companies upon hearing the song record labels began contacting the band through sub pop the band released the screaming life ep in 1987 and the fopp ep in 1988 a combination of the two was issued as screaming life fopp in 1990 though the band was being courted by major labels in 1988 it signed to the lesser known sst records to release its debut album ultramega ok released on october 31 1988 cornell said that the band made a huge mistake with ultramega ok due to using a producer suggested by sst who didn t know what was happening in seattle steve huey of allmusic said that the album is the best expression of soundgarden s early stooges mc5 meets zeppelin sabbath sound the band s first music video flower  was directed by mark miremont and aired regularly on mtv s 120 minutes soundgarden supported ultramega ok with a tour in the united states in the spring of 1989 and a tour in europe which began in may 1989 and was the band s first overseas tour ultramega ok earned the band a grammy nomination for best metal performance in 1990 after touring in support of ultramega ok the band signed with a m records the signing caused a rift between soundgarden and its traditional audience thayil said in the beginning our fans came from the punk rock crowd they abandoned us when they thought we had sold out the punk tenets getting on a major label and touring with guns n roses there were fashion issues and social issues and people thought we no longer belonged to their scene to their particular sub culture the band subsequently began work on its first album for a major label cornell said at the time hiro had excommunicated himself from the band and there wasn t a free flowing system as far as music went so i ended up writing a lot of it on september 5 1989 the band released its second album louder than love regarding the album steve huey of allmusic said that the band took a step toward the metal mainstream with a slow grinding detuned mountain of sabbath zeppelin riffs and chris cornell wailing because of some of the song lyrics most notably on hands all over and big dumb sex the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album s release louder than love became the band s first album to chart on the billboard 200 peaking at number 108 on the chart in 1990 a month before touring for louder than love commenced bassist hiro yamamoto who was becoming frustrated that he wasn t contributing much left to go back to college he was replaced by jason everman formerly of nirvana the band embarked on a north american tour that went from december 1989 to march 1990 on this tour the band served as the opening act for voivod on the band s nothingface tour with faith no more also serving as an opening act at the beginning and end of the tour the band then went on to tour europe bassist jason everman was fired immediately after soundgarden completed its promotional tour for louder than love in mid 1990 thayil said that jason just didn t work out louder than love spawned the ep loudest love and the video compilation louder than live both released in 1990 bassist ben shepherd replaced previous bassist jason everman and the new line up recorded soundgarden s third album in 1991 cornell said that shepherd brought a fresh and creative approach to the recording sessions and the band as a whole said that his knowledge of music and writing skills redefined the band the resulting album badmotorfinger was released on october 8 1991 steve huey of allmusic said that the songwriting on badmotorfinger takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency he added it s surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences thayil suggested that the album s lyrics are like reading a novel man s conflict with himself and society or the government or his family or the economy or anything the first single from badmotorfinger jesus christ pose  garnered attention when mtv decided to ban its corresponding music video in 1991 many listeners were outraged by the song and its video perceiving it as anti christian the band received death threats while on tour in the united kingdom in support of the album cornell explained that the lyrics criticize public figures who use religion to portray themselves as being persecuted although overshadowed at the time of its release by the sudden popularity of nirvana s nevermind the focus of attention brought by nevermind to the seattle scene helped soundgarden gain wider attention the singles outshined and rusty cage were able to find an audience at alternative rock radio and mtv badmotorfinger was nominated for a grammy for best metal performance in 1992 the album was among the 100 top selling albums of 1992 following the release of badmotorfinger soundgarden went on a tour in north america that ran from october 1991 to november 1991 afterward the band took a slot opening for guns n roses in north america on the band s use your illusion tour soundgarden was personally selected by guns n roses as its opening band the band took a slot opening for skid row in north america in february 1992 on the band s slave to the grind tour and then headed to europe for a month long headlining theater tour the band returned for a tour in the united states and subsequently rejoined guns n roses in the summer of 1992 in europe as part of the use your illusion tour along with fellow opening act faith no more regarding the time spent opening for guns n roses cornell said it wasn t a whole lot of fun going out in front of 40 000 people for 35 minutes every day most of them hadn t heard our songs and didn t care about them it was a bizarre thing the band would go on to play the 1992 lollapalooza tour with the red hot chili peppers pearl jam and ministry among others the band later released the video compilation motorvision which was filmed at the paramount theatre in 1992 the band also made an appearance in the movie singles performing birth ritual the song appeared on the soundtrack as did a cornell solo song seasons soundgarden began work on its fourth album after touring in support of badmotorfinger cornell said that while working on the album the band members allowed each other more freedom than on past records while thayil observed that the band spent a lot more time working on the actual recording of the songs than on previous records released on march 8 1994 superunknown became the band s breakthrough album driven by the singles spoonman the day i tried to live black hole sun my wave and fell on black days upon its release in march 1994 superunknown debuted at number one on the billboard 200 album chart the songs on superunknown captured the creativity and heaviness of the band s earlier works while showcasing the group s newly evolving style lyrically the album was quite dark and mysterious as much of it is often interpreted to be dealing with substance abuse suicide and depression cornell was inspired by the writings of sylvia plath at the time the album was also more experimental than previous releases with some songs incorporating middle eastern or indian music j d considine of rolling stone said superunknown demonstrates far greater range than many bands manage in an entire career he also stated at its best superunknown offers a more harrowing depiction of alienation and despair than anything on in utero the music video for black hole sun became a hit on mtv and received the award for best metal hard rock video at the 1994 mtv video music awards soundgarden won two grammy awards in 1995 black hole sun received the award for best hard rock performance and spoonman received the award for best metal performance superunknown has been certified five times platinum in the united states and remains soundgarden s most successful album the band began touring in january 1994 in australia japan and new zealand areas where the record came out early as well as regions where the band had never toured before this round of touring ended in february 1994 and then in march 1994 the band moved on to europe the band began a theater tour of the united states on may 27 1994 with the opening acts tad and eleven in late 1994 after touring in support of superunknown doctors discovered that cornell had severely strained his vocal cords soundgarden cancelled several shows to avoid causing any permanent damage cornell said i think we kinda overdid it we were playing five or six nights a week and my voice pretty much took a beating towards the end of the american tour i felt like i could still kinda sing but i wasn t really giving the band a fair shake you don t buy a ticket to see some guy croak for two hours that seemed like kind of a rip off the band would make up the dates later in 1995 superunknown spawned the ep songs from the superunknown and the cd rom alive in the superunknown both released in 1995 following the worldwide tour in support of its previous album superunknown the band commenced work on what would become the band s final album the members of soundgarden opted to self produce the record however tensions within the group reportedly arose during the sessions with thayil and cornell allegedly clashing over cornell s desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band s trademark cornell said by the time we were finished it felt like it had been kind of hard like it was a long hard haul but there was stuff we were discovering the band s fifth album down on the upside was released on may 21 1996 the album was notably less heavy than the group s preceding albums and marked a further departure from the band s grunge roots soundgarden explained at the time that it wanted to experiment with other sounds david browne of entertainment weekly said few bands since led zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric the overall mood of the album s lyrics isn t as dark as on previous soundgarden albums with cornell describing some songs as self affirming the album spawned several singles including pretty noose burden in my hand  and blow up the outside world despite favorable reviews the album did not match the sales of superunknown the band took a slot on the 1996 lollapalooza tour with metallica who had insisted on soundgarden s appearance on the tour after lollapalooza the band embarked on a worldwide tour tensions continued to increase during the band s ensuing tour in support of the album when asked if the band hated touring cornell said we really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious because it becomes repetitious you feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them that s the point where we hate touring at the tour s final stop in honolulu hawaii on february 9 1997 shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure and subsequently stormed off the stage the band retreated with cornell returning to conclude the show with a solo encore on april 9 1997 the band announced its disbanding thayil said it was pretty obvious from everybody s general attitude over the course of the previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction soundgarden s final release a greatest hits compilation entitled a sides was released the following fall chris cornell released a solo album in september 1999 entitled euphoria morning later in 2001 he formed the supergroup audioslave with the former instrumental members of rage against the machine and recorded three albums as audioslave s vocalist out of exile and revelations cornell departed audioslave in early 2007 resulting in the band s break up his second solo album carry on was released in june 2007 and his third solo album scream was released in march 2009 both to mixed commercial and critical success kim thayil joined forces with former dead kennedys vocalist jello biafra former nirvana bassist krist novoselic and drummer gina mainwal for one show performing as the no wto combo during the wto ministerial conference in seattle on december 1 1999 thayil later contributed guitar tracks to steve fisk s 2001 album 999 levels of undo as well as dave grohl s 2004 side project album probot in 2006 thayil performed guitar on the album altar the collaboration between the bands sunn o and boris matt cameron initially turned his efforts to his side project wellwater conspiracy to which both shepherd and thayil have contributed performances he then worked briefly with the smashing pumpkins on the band s 1998 album adore and was even rumored as a replacement for jimmy chamberlin in 1998 he stepped in on drums for pearl jam s yield tour and subsequently joined pearl jam as a permanent member and has recorded three albums as the band s drummer riot act and pearl jam ben shepherd was the vocalist on wellwater conspiracy s 1997 debut studio album declaration of conformity however he left the band in 1998 he has toured with mark lanegan and played bass on two of lanegan s albums the 1999 album i ll take care of you and the 2001 album field songs shepherd and cameron were part of the side project band hater while they were members of soundgarden and in 2005 shepherd released the band s long delayed second album the 2nd in an interview in early august 2007 cornell mentioned that thayil has wanted to release a box set or b sides album of soundgarden rarities although no further information was given furthermore on march 12 2008 cornell had this to say about a b sides album as well as a possible box set upon being asked if there was any forward movement on this project i think it s one of those things where it s probably kind of overdue i think that we made a huge contribution to our generation of rock music and when it comes to the business representatives of soundgarden i think they kind of let soundgarden down as far as keeping our legacy out there and active we need to kind of go back in i think and get some things going to y know get stuff out there to our fans and to new fans because new fans are being made like when i was a kid i discovered bands that had been broken up but that i d been turned on to by my older brothers i think it s important that a box set come out and that a b sides album comes out and that we have an active website where people can be active fans of the band and merchandising and things like that i think we were an important band regarding a future soundgarden reunion cornell stated in an october 2005 interview that it would probably not happen he continued it s almost like we sealed the lid and said this is soundgarden and this is its lifespan and put it out there and it looks really great to me i think getting back together would take the lid off that and then could possibly change what to me seems like the perfect lifespan of the band i can t think of any reason to mess with that in interviews following his departure from audioslave in february 2007 cornell reiterated that the members of soundgarden had no interest in reuniting stressing the point further in a later interview with nme where he stated when soundgarden broke up my discussions with the rest of the band was we have to have an agreement that we will never tour soundgarden soundgarden will never exist without it being a unanimous decision and that everyone who was in the band is in the band on march 24 2009 thayil cameron and shepherd reunited with tad doyle on lead vocals to perform hunted down nothing to say and spoonman at a tom morello solo show at the crocodile cafe in seattle soundgarden was a pioneer of the grunge music genre which mixed elements of punk rock and heavy metal into a dirty aggressive sound soundgarden s sound during the early years of the seattle grunge scene has been described as consisting of gnarled neo zeppelinisms the influence of led zeppelin was evident with q magazine noting that soundgarden were in thrall to 70s rock but contemptuous of the genre s overt sexism and machismo sub pop viewed the band as having an angle that featured a hunky lead singer and fused led zeppelin and the butthole surfers the butthole surfers mix of punk heavy metal and noise rock was a major influence on the early work of soundgarden soundgarden and other early grunge bands were also influenced by british post punk bands such as gang of four and bauhaus which were popular in the early 1980s seattle scene soundgarden broadened its musical range with its later releases by 1994 s superunknown the band began to incorporate more pop and psychedelic influences into its music as a member of soundgarden cornell became known for his wide vocal range and his dark existentialist lyrics soundgarden would often utilize alternative tunings and odd time signatures in its songs many soundgarden songs were performed in drop d tuning including jesus christ pose outshined spoonman and black hole sun the e strings of the instruments were at times tuned lower such as on rusty cage where the bottom e string is tuned all the way down to b some songs use more unorthodox tunings my wave and the day i tried to live are both in a e e b b b e tuning soundgarden s use of odd meter time signatures was varied as well while such songs as jesus christ pose are in typical 4 4 time outshined is in 7 4 my wave uses 5 4 fell on black days is in 6 4 never the machine forever uses 9 8 rusty cage uses 4 4 in its chorus and a repeated pattern of 6 4 2 4 and 5 4 in its coda and spoonman alternates between 7 4 and 4 4 sections thayil has said that soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band had written it and said that the use of odd meters was a total accident soundgarden was one of the early bands of the 1980s seattle music scene and is regarded as being one of the originators of the genre later known as grunge the development of the seattle independent record label sub pop is tied closely to soundgarden the funding provided by sub pop co founder jonathan poneman for soundgarden s early releases lead to the expansion of sub pop as a serious record label nirvana frontman kurt cobain was a fan of soundgarden s early music and reportedly soundgarden s involvement with sub pop influenced cobain to sign nirvana with the label soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label when the band joined the roster of a m records in 1989 soundgarden however did not achieve initial success rather successive album releases by the band were met with increased sales and wider attention soundgarden has been praised for its technical musical ability and the expansion of its sound as its career progressed heavy yet ethereal powerful yet always in control soundgarden s music was a study in contrasts said henry wilson of hit parader wilson proclaimed the band s music as a brilliant display of technical proficiency tempered by heart felt emotion soundgarden is one of the bands credited with the development of the genre of alternative metal with stephen thomas erlewine of allmusic stating that soundgarden made a place for heavy metal in alternative rock the band inspired and influenced a number of bands ranging from between the buried and me to the dillinger escape plan and evanescence regarding soundgarden s legacy in a 2007 interview cornell said i think and this is now with some distance in listening to the records but on the outside looking in with all earnestness i think soundgarden made the best records out of that scene i think we were the most daring and experimental and genre pushing really and i m really proud of it and i guess that s why i have trepidation about the idea of reforming i don t know what it would mean i guess i just have this image of who we were and i had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being soundgarden as we all did that it was a responsibility and it was an important band of music and we didn t want to mess it up and we managed to not which i felt is a great achievement 
in musical terminology tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece it is a crucial element of composition as it can affect the mood and difficulty of a piece the plural of tempo is tempi the tempo of a piece will typically be written at the start of a piece of music and in modern music is usually indicated in beats per minute this means that a particular note value is specified as the beat and the marking indicates that a certain number of these beats must be played per minute the greater the tempo the larger the number of beats that must be played in a minute is and therefore the faster a piece must be played mathematical tempo markings of this kind became increasingly popular during the first half of the 19th century after the metronome had been invented by johann nepomuk mälzel although early metronomes were somewhat inconsistent beethoven was the first composer to use the metronome and in 1817 he published metronomic indications for his eight symphonies unfortunately the metronome markings on his hammerklavier sonata and ninth symphony are almost impossibly fast as is also the case for many of the works of schumann with the advent of modern electronics bpm became an extremely precise measure midi files and other types of sequencing software use the bpm system to denote tempo as an alternative to metronome markings some 20th century composers would give the total execution time of a piece from which the proper tempo can be roughly derived tempo is as crucial in contemporary music as it is in classical in electronic dance music accurate knowledge of a tune s bpm is important to djs for the purposes of beatmatching whether a music piece has a mathematical time indication or not in classical music it is customary to describe the tempo of a piece by one or more words most of these words are italian because many of the most important composers of the 17th century were italian and this period was when tempo indications were first used extensively before the metronome words were the only way to describe the tempo of a composition yet after the metronome s invention these words continued to be used often additionally indicating the mood of the piece thus blurring the traditional distinction between tempo and mood indicators for example presto and allegro both indicate a speedy execution but allegro also connotes joy presto on the other hand indicates speed as such additional italian words also indicate tempo and mood for example the agitato in the allegro agitato of the last movement of george gershwin s piano concerto in f has both a tempo indication and a mood indication in some cases conventions governing musical composition were so strong that no tempo had to be indicated for example the first movement of bach s brandenburg concerto no 3 has no tempo or mood indication whatsoever to provide movement names publishers of recordings resort to ad hoc measures for instance marking the brandenburg movement allegro   and so on in renaissance music most music was understood to flow at a tempo defined by the tactus roughly the rate of the human heartbeat which note value corresponded to the tactus was indicated by the mensural time signature often a particular musical form or genre implies its own tempo so no further explanation is placed in the score thus musicians expect a minuet to be performed at a fairly stately tempo slower than a viennese waltz a perpetuum mobile to be quite fast and so on genres can be used to imply tempos thus ludwig van beethoven wrote in tempo d un menuetto over the first movement of his piano sonata op 54 although that movement is not a minuet popular music charts use terms such as bossa nova ballad and latin rock in much the same way it is important to remember when interpreting these words that not only have tempos changed over historical time and even in different places but sometimes even the ordering of terms has changed thus a modern largo is slower than an adagio but in the baroque period it was faster the definitions of the italian tempo markings mentioned in this section can be found in the harvard dictionary of music and or the online italian english dictionary both of which are listed in sources from fastest to slowest the common tempo markings are additional terms all of these markings are based on a few root words such as allegro largo adagio vivace presto andante and lento by adding the issimo ending the word is amplified by adding the ino ending the word is diminished and by adding the etto ending the word is endeared many tempos also can be translated with the same meaning and it is up to the player to interpret the speed that best suits the period composer and individual work note metronome markings are a guide only and depending on the time signature and the piece itself these figures may not be appropriate in every circumstance note in addition to the common allegretto composers freely apply italian diminutive and superlative suffixes to various tempo indications andantino larghetto adagietto and larghissimo some markings that primarily mark a mood also have a tempo connotation composers may use expressive marks to adjust the tempo while the base tempo indication appears in large type above the staff these adjustments typically appear below the staff or in the middle of the grand staff they generally designate a gradual change in tempo for immediate tempo shifts composers normally just provide the designation for the new tempo several terms control how large and how gradual this change is after a tempo change a composer may return to a previous tempo in two different ways these terms also indicate an immediate not a gradual tempo change although they are italian composers typically use them even if they have written their initial tempo marking in some other language although italian has been the prevalent language for tempo markings throughout most of classical music history many composers have written tempo indications in their own language the definitions of the tempo markings mentioned in this section can be found in the harvard dictionary of music and or the online foreign language dictionaries which are listed in sources several composers have written markings in french among them baroque composers françois couperin and jean philippe rameau as well as claude debussy olivier messiaen maurice ravel and alexander scriabin common tempo markings in french are many composers have used german tempo markings typical german tempo markings are one of the first german composers to use tempo markings in his native language was ludwig van beethoven the one using the most elaborate combined tempo and mood markings was probably gustav mahler for example the second movement of his symphony no 9 is marked im tempo eines gemächlichen ländlers etwas täppisch und sehr derb indicating a slowish folk dance like movement with some awkwardness and vulgarity in the execution mahler would also sometimes combine german tempo markings with traditional italian markings as in the first movement of his sixth symphony marked allegro energico ma non troppo heftig aber markig english indications for example quickly have also been used by benjamin britten and percy grainger among many others in jazz and popular music charts terms like fast laid back steady rock medium medium up ballad and similar style indications may appear generally composers will name movements of compositions after their tempo marking for instance the second movement of samuel barber s first string quartet is an adagio some such movements may start to lead a life of their own and become known with the tempo mood marker name for instance the string orchestra version of the second movement of barber s first string quartet became known as adagio for strings a similar example is mahler s most famous work the adagietto from his symphony no 5 another is mozart s alla turca sometimes the link between a musical composition with a tempo name and a separate movement of a composition is less clear for instance albinoni s adagio a 20th century creative reconstruction based on an incomplete manuscript some composers chose to include tempo indicators in the name of a separate composition for instance bartók in allegro barbaro a single movement composition when performers unintentionally speed up they are said to rush the similar term for unintentionally slowing down is drag unless practiced by an experienced performer to achieve a particular musical effect these actions are undesirable dragging can often indicate a hesitance in the performer due to lack of practice rushing can likewise destroy the pulse of the music because of their negative connotation neither rush nor drag are often used as tempo indications in scores mahler being a notable exception as part of a tempo indication he used schleppend in the first movement of his symphony no 1 for example by practising with a metronome a musician can try to gain control over rushing or dragging books on tempo in music music dictionary general language dictionaries 
sacred harp singing is a tradition of sacred choral music that took root in the southern region of the united states it is part of the larger tradition of shape note music the name of the tradition comes from the title of the shape note book from which the music is sung the sacred harp this book exists today in various editions discussed below shape note music means that the notes are printed in special shapes that help the reader fluently identify them on the musical scale each of the four shapes is connected to a particular syllable fa sol la and mi and these syllables are employed in singing the notes just as in the more familiar system that uses do re mi etc the system used in the sacred harp is able to cover the full musical scale because each syllable shape combination other than mi is assigned to two distinct notes of the scale for example the c major scale would be notated and sung as follows as can be seen the shape for fa is a triangle sol an oval la a rectangle and mi a diamond the shapes and notes designate degrees of the scale not particular pitches thus for a song in the key of c fa designates c and f for a song in g fa designates g and c and so on hence it is called a moveable do system when sacred harp singers begin a song they normally start by singing it with the appropriate syllable for each pitch using the shapes to guide them for those in the group not yet familiar with the song the shapes help with the task of sight reading the process of reading through the song with the shapes also helps fix the notes in memory once the shapes have been sung the group then sings the verses of the song with their printed words sacred harp groups always sing a cappella that is to say without accompanying instruments the singers arrange themselves in a hollow square with rows of chairs or pews on each side assigned to each of the four parts treble alto tenor and bass the treble and tenor sections are usually mixed with men and women singing the notes an octave apart there is no single leader or conductor rather the participants take turns in leading the leader for a particular round selects a song from the book and calls it by its page number leading is done in an open palm style standing in the middle of the square facing the tenors the pitch at which the music is sung is relative there is no instrument to give the singers a starting point the leader or else some particular singer assigned to the task finds a good pitch with which to begin and intones it to the group the singers reply with the opening notes of their own parts and then the song begins immediately the music is usually sung not literally as it is printed in the book but with certain deviations established by custom see how sacred harp music is sung as the name implies sacred harp music is sacred music many of the songs in the book are hymns that use words meters and stanzaic forms familiar from elsewhere in protestant hymnody however sacred harp songs are quite different from mainstream protestant hymns in their musical style they are often polyphonic in texture and the harmony tends to deemphasize the interval of the third in favor of fourths and fifths in their melodies the songs often use the pentatonic scale or similar gapped scales in their musical form sacred harp songs fall into three basic types many are ordinary hymn tunes mostly composed in four bar phrases and sung in multiple verses fuguing tunes contain a prominent passage about 1 3 of the way through in which each of the four choral parts enters in succession in a way resembling a fugue anthems are longer songs less regular in form that are sung through just once rather than in multiple verses sacred harp singing normally occurs not in church services but in special gatherings or singings arranged for the purpose singings can be local regional statewide or national small singings are often held in homes with perhaps only a dozen singers large singings have been known to have more than a thousand participants the more ambitious singings include an ample potluck dinner in the middle of the day traditionally called dinner on the grounds some of the largest and oldest annual singings are called conventions the oldest sacred harp convention was the southern musical convention organized in upson county georgia in 1845 the two oldest surviving sacred harp singing conventions are the chattahoochee musical convention and the east texas sacred harp convention sacred harp singers view their tradition as a participatory one not a passive one those who gather for a singing sing for themselves and for each other and not for an audience this can be seen in several aspects of the tradition first the seating arrangement is clearly intended for the singers not for external listeners non singers are always welcome to attend a singing but typically they sit among the singers in the back rows of the tenor section rather than in any particular designated audience location the leader being equidistant from all sections in principle hears the best sound the often intense sonic experience of standing in the center of the square is considered one of the perquisites of leading and sometimes a guest will be invited as a courtesy to stand next to the leader during a song the music itself is also meant to be participatory most forms of choral composition place the melody on the top line where it can be best heard by an audience with the other parts written so as not to obscure the melody in contrast sacred harp composers have aimed to make each musical part singable and interesting in its own right thus giving every singer in the group an absorbing task for this reason bringing out the melody is not a high priority in sacred harp composition and indeed it is customary to assign the melody not to the trebles but to the tenors fuging tunes in which each section gets its moment to shine also illustrate the importance in sacred harp of maintaining the independence of each vocal part marini traces the earliest roots of sacred harp to the country parish music of early 18th century england this form of rural church music evolved a number of the distinctive traits that were passed on from tradition to tradition until they ultimately became part of sacred harp singing these traits included the assignment of the melody to the tenors harmonic structure emphasizing fourths and fifth and the distinction between the ordinary four part hymn the anthem and the fuging tune several composers of this school including joseph stephenson and aaron williams are represented in the 1991 edition of the sacred harp for further information on the english roots of sacred harp music see west gallery music around the mid 18th century the forms and styles of english country parish music were introduced to america notably in a new hymnal called urania published 1764 by the singing master james lyon this stimulus soon led to the development of a robust native school of composition signaled by the 1770 publication of william billings s the new england psalm singer and then by a great number of new compositions by billings and those who followed in his path the work of these composers sometimes called the first new england school forms a major part of the sacred harp to this day billings and his followers worked as singing masters who led singing schools the purpose of these schools was to train young people in the correct singing of sacred music this pedagogical movement flourished and led ultimately to the invention of shape notes which originated as way to making the teaching of singing easier the first shape note hymnal appeared in 1801 the easy instructor by william smith and william little at first smith and little s shapes competed with a rival system created by andrew law in his the musical primer of 1803 although this book came out two years later than smith and little s book law claimed earlier invention of shape notes in his system a square indicated fa a circle sol a triangle la and a diamond mi law used the shaped notes without a musical staff the smith and little shapes ultimately prevailed shape notes became very popular and during the first part of the nineteenth century a whole series of shape note hymnbooks appeared many of which were widely distributed as the population spread west and south the tradition of shape note singing expanded geographically composition flourished with the new hymns often drawing on the tradition of folk song for tunes and inspiration probably the most successful shape note book prior to the sacred harp was william walker s southern harmony published in 1835 and still in use today even as they flourished and spread shape notes and the kind of participatory music which they served came under attack the critics were from the urban based better music movement spearheaded by lowell mason which advocated a new form of hymnody more scientific and based on the rules of harmony prevailing in european music the new hymnody gradually prevailed shape notes and their music disappeared from the cities prior to the civil war and from the rural areas of the northeast and midwest in the following decades however they retained a haven in the rural south which remained a fertile territory for the creation of new shapenote hymnbooks sacred harp singing came into being with the 1844 publication of benjamin franklin white and elisha j king s the sacred harp it was this book now distributed in several different versions that came to be the shape note tradition with the largest number of participants b f white was originally from union county south carolina but since 1842 had been living in harris county georgia he prepared the sacred harp in collaboration with a younger man e j king who was from talbot county georgia together they compiled transcribed and composed tunes and published a book of over 250 songs king died soon after the book was published and white was left to guide its growth he was responsible for organizing singing schools and conventions at which the sacred harp was used as the songbook during his lifetime the book became popular and would go through three revisions all produced by committees consisting of white and several colleagues working under the auspices of the southern musical convention the first two new editions simply added appendices of new songs to the back of the book the 1869 revision was more extensive removing some of the less popular songs and adding new ones in their places from the original 262 pages the book was expanded by 1869 to 477 this edition was reprinted and continued in use for several decades around the turn of the 20th century sacred harp singing entered a period of conflict over the issue of traditionalism the conflict ultimately split the community b f white had died in 1879 before completing a fourth revision of his book thus the version that sacred harp participants were singing from was by the turn of the century over three decades old during this time the musical tastes of sacred harp s traditional adherents the inhabitants of the rural south had changed in important ways notably gospel music syncopated and chromatic often with piano accompaniment had become popular along with a number of church hymns of the mainstream variety such as rock of ages seven shape notation systems had appeared and won adherents away from the older four shape system as time passed sacred harp singers doubtless became aware that what they were singing had become quite distinct from contemporary tastes the natural path to take and the one ultimately taken would be to assert the archaic character of sacred harp as an outright virtue in this view sacred harp should be treasured as a time tested musical tradition standing above current trends of fashion the difficulty with adopting traditionalism as a guiding doctrine was that different singers had different opinions about just what form the stable traditionalized version of sacred harp would take the first move was made by w m cooper of dothan alabama who was a leading sacred harp teacher in his own region but not part of the inner circle of b f white s old colleagues and descendants in 1902 cooper prepared a revision of the sacred harp that while retaining most of the old songs also added new tunes that reflected more contemporary music styles cooper made other changes too the cooper revision was a success being widely adopted in many areas of the south such as florida southern alabama and texas where it has continued as the predominant sacred harp book to this day the cooper book as it is now often called was revised by cooper himself in 1907 and 1909 and since then has been supervised by an editorial committee which produced new editions in 1927 1950 1960 1992 2000 and 2006 however in the original core geographic area of sacred harp singing northern alabama and georgia the singers did not in general take to the cooper book as they felt it deviated too far from the original tradition obtaining a new book for these singers was made more difficult by the fact that b f white s son james l white who would have been the natural choice to prepare a new edition was a non traditionalist ultimately a committee headed by joseph summerlin james produced a new edition that largely satisfied the wishes of this community of singers the james edition was later revised in a version that moved somewhat further in the direction of traditionalism this revision was completed in 1936 by a committee under the leadership of the brothers seaborn and thomas denson both influential singing school teachers both died shortly before the project was complete and the remaining work was overseen by paine denson son of thomas this version of the sacred harp is still often called the denson book later editorial committees produced further revisions of this book in 1960 1967 1971 and 1991 even the highly traditionalist james and denson books followed cooper in adding alto parts to most of the old three part songs some people believe that the new alto parts imposed an esthetic cost by filling in the former stark open harmonies of the three part songs wallace mckenzie argues to the contrary basing his view on a systematic study of representative songs in any event there is little support today for abandoning the added alto parts since most singers give a high priority to giving every side of the square its own part to sing it was thus that the traditionalism debate split the sacred harp community and there seems little prospect that it will ever reunite under a single book however there have been no further splits both the denson and the cooper groups adopted traditionalist views for the particular form of sacred harp they favored and these forms have now been stable for about a century the strength of traditionalism can be seen in the front matter of the two hymnbooks the denson book is forthrightly biblical in its defense of tradition the cooper book also shows a warm appreciation of tradition to say that both communities are traditionalist does not mean they discourage the creation of new songs to the contrary it is part of the tradition that musically creative sacred harp singers should become composers themselves and add to the canon the new compositions are prepared in traditional styles and could be considered a kind of tribute to the older material new songs have been incorporated into editions of the sacred harp throughout the 20th century two other books are currently used by sacred harp singers a few singers in north georgia employ the white book an expanded version of the 1869 b f white edition edited by j l white african american sacred harp singers although primarily users of the cooper book also make use of a supplementary volume the colored sacred harp produced by judge jackson in 1934 and later revised in two subsequent editions in his book judge jackson and the colored sacred harp joe dan boyd has identified four regions of sacred harp singing among african americans eastern texas northern mississippi south alabama and florida and new jersey the colored sacred harp is limited to the new jersey and south alabama florida groups sacred harp was exported from south alabama to new jersey it appears to have died out among the african americans in eastern texas in summary three revisions of and one companion book to the sacred harp are currently in use in sacred harp singing sacred harp books generally contain a section of rudiments describing the basics of music and sacred harp singing in recent years sacred harp singing has experienced a resurgence in popularity as it is discovered by new participants who did not grow up in the tradition there are now strong sacred harp singing communities in most major urban areas of the united states and in many rural areas as well one of the first groups of singers formed outside the traditional southern home region of sacred harp singing was in greater chicago the first illinois convention was held in 1985 with enthusiastic and strongly proactive support by prominent southern traditional singers the midwest convention is now acknowledged to be one of the major american conventions attracting hundreds of singers from all over the us and abroad similarly the sacred harp singing community in western new england has become a prominent one in recent years in march 2008 the 2008 western massachusetts sacred harp convention attracted over 300 singers from 25 states and a number of foreign countries other prominent singing conventions outside the south include for example the garden state sacred harp singing convention in new jersey and the minnesota state convention which is now in its 19th year sacred harp singing has now spread even beyond the borders of the united states there is an active sacred harp community in the uk for example new singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers for instance the rudiments section of the 1991 denson edition includes information on how to hold a singing this information would be superfluous in a traditional context but is important for a group starting up on its own the tradition of the singing master is still carried on today and singing masters from traditional sacred harp regions often travel outside the south to teach in recent years an annual summer camp has been established at which newcomers can learn to sing sacred harp the music used in sacred harp singing is eclectic most of the songs can be assigned to one of four historical layers there are a few additional songs in the sacred harp 1991 edition that cannot be assigned to any of these four main layers there are some very old songs of european origin as well as songs from the english rural tradition that inspired the early new england composers there are also a handful of songs by european classical composers the book even includes a couple of hymns by lowell mason long ago the implacable enemy of the tradition that the sacred harp has preserved to this day the description just given is based on the the sacred harp 1991 edition also known as the denson edition the widely used cooper edition overlaps considerably in content but also includes many later songs a detailed comparison of the two editions has been made by sacred harp scholar gaylon l powell available here the sacred harp was a popular name for 19th century hymn and tune books with no fewer than four bearing the title the first of these was compiled by john hoyt hickok and printed in lewiston pennsylvania in 1832 the second was compiled by lowell and timothy mason and printed in cincinnati ohio in 1834 as part of the better music movement mentioned above amusingly the mason brothers publisher brought this book out in a shape note edition much against their wishes the third sacred harp was the one by b f white and e j king the origin of today s sacred harp singing tradition lastly according to w j reynolds writing in hymns of our faith there was yet a fourth sacred harp the sacred harp published by j m d cates in nashville tennessee in 1867 see

negativland is an experimental music and sound collage band which originated in the san francisco bay area in the late 1970s they took their name from a neu song while their record label is named after another neu song the current core of the band consists of mark hosler richard lyons don joyce david wills and peter conheim negativland has released a number of albums ranging from pure sound collage to more musical expositions these have mostly been released on their own label seeland records in the late 1980s and early 1990s they produced several recordings for sst records most notably escape from noise helter stupid and u 2 negativland became involved in a lawsuit with u2 s lawyers which brought them widespread publicity and notoriety but nearly destroyed them as a band negativland started in concord california in 1979 around the core founding members of lyons and hosler and released an eponymous debut in 1980 a number of releases followed in the early 1980s but it wasn t until after the release of their breakthrough sample and cut up sonic barrage escape from noise in 1987 that negativland gained wider attention vinyl copies of the album came with car bomb bumper stickers in reference to the album s song car bomb following the somewhat unexpected success of this album negativland faced the prospect of going on a money losing tour to prevent this they put together a press release it insisted that the acts of an axe murderer named david brom had not been incited by their song christianity is stupid there had never been any claim that the song had incited the act however the song contained samples deriding christianity taken from the pro christianity film if footmen tire you what will horses do the story ran on tv news shows newspapers and magazines with little to no fact checking soon the world was informed of the killer song that caused a kid to murder his parents with an ax the scandal became the foundation for their next release helter stupid which featured a cover photo of tv news anchorman dave mcelhatton intoning the ax murder story with the news station s caption killer song above his head and a photo of the ax murderer negativland s next project was the u2 ep with samples from american top 40 host casey kasem in 1991 negativland released a single with the title u2 displayed in very large type on the front of the packaging and negativland in a smaller typeface an image of the lockheed u 2 spy plane was also on the single cover the songs within were parodies of the group u2 s well known 1987 song i still haven t found what i m looking for including kazoos and extensive sampling of the original song the song the letter u and the numeral 2 features a musical backing to an extended profane rant from well known disc jockey casey kasem lapsing out of his more polished and professional tone during a frustrating rehearsal which had gone out to many stations as raw feed and was taped by several engineers who had been passing it around for a number of years one of kasem s milder comments was these guys are from england and who gives a shit u2 s label island records quickly sued negativland claiming that placing the word u2 on the cover violated trademark law as did the song itself island records also contended that the single was an attempt to deliberately confuse u2 fans awaiting the impending release of achtung baby into purchasing what they believed was a new u2 album called negativland in june 1992 r u sirius publisher of the magazine mondo 2000 came up with an interesting idea publicists from u2 had contacted him regarding the possibility of interviewing dave the edge evans hoping to promote u2 s impending multi million dollar zoo tv tour which featured found sounds and live sampling from mass media outlets sirius unbeknownst to edge decided to have his friends joyce and hosler of negativland conduct the interview joyce and hosler fresh from island s lawsuit peppered the edge with questions regarding his ideas about the use of sampling in their new tour and the legality of using copyrighted material without permission midway through the interview joyce and hosler revealed their identities as members of negativland an embarrassed edge reported that u2 were bothered by the sledgehammer legal approach island records took in their lawsuit and furthermore that much of the legal wrangling took place without u2 s knowledge by the time we realized what was going on it was kinda too late and we actually did approach the record company on your behalf and said look c mon this is just this is very heavy island records reported to negativland that u2 never authorized samples of their material evans response was that s complete bollocks there s like there s at least six records out there that are direct samples from our stuff the u2 single was re released in 2001 on a bootleg album entitled these guys are from england and who gives a shit released on seelard records it is thought likely that negativland themselves were responsible for the re release and that u2 gave their blessing although the negativland website refers to this release as a bootleg it is available from major retailers like best buy amazon and tower records as well as negativland s own mail order business negativland are interested in intellectual property rights and argue that their use of u2 s and others material falls under the fair use clause in 1995 they released a book with accompanying cd called fair use the story of the letter u and the numeral 2 about the whole u2 incident the book ends with a large appendix of essays about fair use and copyright by negativland and others telling the story with newspaper clippings court papers faxes press releases and other documents arranged in chronological order an unfortunate side effect of the negativland island lawsuit was another one brought on between negativland and sst which served to sever all remaining ties the two had to get back at negativland sst founder greg ginn later released the negativland live on tour album on sst negativland were the main subjects of craig baldwin s documentary sonic outlaws detailing the use of

guided by voices was an american indie rock band originating from dayton ohio since the band s formation in 1983 it experienced frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter robert pollard guided by voices disbanded in 2004 though many of its former members remain musically involved in solo careers or other side projects noted at first for its lo fi aesthetic and typically portastudio four tracks to cassette production methods guided by voices music revealed influences from post british invasion garage rock psychedelic rock progressive rock punk rock and post punk the band also garnered much attention for its prolific output with a seemingly endless stream of releases most songs are in the two minute range but many are even shorter often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade sound effects formed in dayton ohio in the early 1980s guided by voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene as lineups and day jobs shifted however pollard moved the band towards a studio only orientation guided by voices recording career began with a stream of self financed independent releases including devil between my toes sandbox self inflicted aerial nostalgia and same place the fly got smashed with only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed these tended to circulate only among the band members family and friends with the release of the ultra limited album propeller in 1992 guided by voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown this was due in part to gaining fans in the college rock circuit and bands such as sonic youth r e m and the breeders new york city and philadelphia were host to guided by voices return to the live stage in 1993 at this time the always fluid guided by voices lineup coalesced around the core of pollard guitarists tobin sprout and mitch mitchell bassist dan toohey and drummer kevin fennell sprout who had briefly featured in an early 80s version of the band had re joined circa propeller and soon became pollard s primary musical foil in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band s catalog 1993 also saw the release of vampire on titus as well as the fast japanese spin cycle and static airplane jive eps over the next year the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as spin magazine in 1994 after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from gbv s history pollard delivered the indie landmark bee thousand via scat records with a distribution deal through indie label matador records soon the band officially signed with matador concurrent with pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full time the band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling lo fi and collage like quality of the records with their energetic live show featuring pollard s homegrown rock theatrics mitch mitchell s windmilling and chain smoking sometime bassist greg demos striped pants a never ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds and prodigious alcohol consumption all around their true matador debut came in 1995 with alien lanes which despite a five figure recording allowance was constructed out of home recorded snippets on the cheap the band s underground following continued to grow with notices coming from mainstream sources such as mtv and rolling stone after sessions for a concept album entitled the power of suck were aborted the band assembled under the bushes under the stars out of their first 24 track studio sessions recorded with kim deal and steve albini among others in 1996 however the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the classic lineup with sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child his painting and as a solo musical career sprout and pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996 sprout s carnival boy and pollard s not in my airforce with each making a guest appearance on the other s album pollard maintained an active parallel solo and side project career alongside gbv releases for the remainder of that band s existence these records were primarily self released because gbv alumni were regularly featured and songs from these albums were frequently included in gbv setlists they are informally considered to be part of the gbv canon pollard created a new incarnation of guided by voices with cleveland glam rockers cobra verde in 1997 the following album mag earwhig combined a new hard rocking swagger with classic lo fi fragments and one track jane of the waking universe that featured the classic lineup for one last time however after another year of rigorous touring the guided by verde lineup split in late 1997 following pollard s announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next guided by voices project cobra verde s doug gillard was tapped for yet another new guided by voices lineup in 1998 which also included classic era bassist greg demos former breeders drummer jim macpherson and eventually former amps breeders guitarist nate farley departing from matador this lineup worked with producer ric ocasek to create what was intended to be guided by voices major label debut initially produced for capitol records do the collapse was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid 1999 on pseudo indie label tvt featuring a slick heavily processed sound previously foreign to gbv albums do the collapse failed to catch on at radio and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews through touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000 guided by voices live act became legendary with shows often stretching past the three hour mark and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs pollard solo tracks impromptu covers of the who david bowie and the rolling stones all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption in addition to multiple swings through the united states and europe 2000 saw the band s first and only visits to australia and japan 2000 was capped with the release of the massive suitcase a four disc 100 song trawl through three decades worth of pollard s enormous reserve of unreleased material 2001 s isolation drills was recorded with rob schnapf who aimed to capture the band s live sound more closely than did ocasek though the album debuted in billboard s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor it did not achieve the sought after radio breakthrough after departing from tvt in 2002 guided by voices returned to matador and released universal truths and cycles a departure from the previous two radio aspiring albums and a return to the band s mid 90 s mid fi aesthetic universal truths producer todd tobias would also record the band s final two albums for matador 2003 saw the release of the prog styled earthquake glue followed by the anthology box set hardcore ufos revelations epiphanies and fast food in the western hemisphere and the greatest hits compilation best of guided by voices human amusements at hourly rates in 2004 pollard announced he was disbanding guided by voices following the release of the half smiles of the decomposed lp and a final farewell tour according to pollard on

merge records the album titled from a compound eye was a double lp produced by todd tobias other pollard albums released on merge and pollard s own label guided by voices inc would follow since gbv s demise pollard has frequently been asked about band reunions in 2007 he told magnet to me it s just cashing in if you re gonna get the band back together it should be to support a new record not just to play the hits that s like doing the county fair circuit i don t see guided by voices reforming for one thing there were 50 or 60 people in guided by voices over time pollard has also commented on the fact that gbv and his solo output are basicially one in the same when he told harp magazine in 2005 you know a lot of people try to distinguish things between what is robert pollard and what is guided by voices i tell them basically that there is no difference i am robert pollard and i am guided by voices in 2008 pollard admitted to almost bringing gbv back for his album robert pollard is off to business but decided against it instead forming a new label titled guided by voices inc the 1998 1999 lineup of the band reunited for a few songs at pollard s 50th birthday in 2007 in october 2008 it was announced that guided by voices music would be used for a 3 d film musical based on the life of cleopatra to be directed by steven soderbergh with script by former gbv member jim greer

the band pollard wrote the soundtrack to soderbergh s film bubble and that music was released as music for bubble in 2004 during the band s final tour many cities around the united states proclaimed a certain day to be guided by voices day in that city some of them include 
busking is the practice of performing in public places for tips and gratuities people engaging in this practice are called buskers busking performances can be just about anything that people find entertaining buskers may do acrobatics animal tricks balloon modelling card tricks clowning comedy contortions escapes dance fire eating fortune telling juggling magic mime and a mime variation where the artist performs as a living statue musical performance puppeteering snake charming storytelling or recite poetry or prose as a bard street art street theatre sword swallowing or present a flea circus busking is a british term used in many areas of the english speaking world buskers are also called street performers or street musicians the place where a busker performs is called their pitch people busk for a variety of reasons for money for fun for the attention they get to meet people and socialize for the love of their art to practise their skills or try out new material in front of an audience some buskers only work part time while others make a living performing full time on the streets some buskers do professional entertainment gigs in addition to working the streets some people manage only pocket change from busking while others can earn substantial incomes a busker s income depends on many conditions including the type and quality of the performance the composition of the audience the weather the location and the time of day competition from other buskers can also play a key role busking can be the bottom rung of the entertainment industry some of the most famous groups and superstars started their careers as buskers examples include joan baez edith piaf roni benise the blue man group pierce brosnan jimmy buffett george burns cirque du soleil eric clapton judy collins bob dylan joe strummer stephane grappelli bob hope jewel steve martin joni mitchell jimmy page dolly parton penn teller gerry rafferty carlos santana simon and garfunkel rod stewart stomp and robin williams many other buskers have also found fame and fortune there are three basic forms of busking circle shows are shows that tend to gather a crowd around them they usually have a distinct beginning and end usually these are done in conjunction with street theater puppeteering magicians comedians acrobats jugglers and sometimes musicians circle shows can be the most lucrative some time the crowds attracted can be huge a good busker will control the crowd so the patrons don t obstruct foot traffic walk by acts are typically with the busker providing a musical or entertaining ambiance there is no distinct beginning or end and the crowds do not particularly stop to watch sometimes an intended walk by act will spontaneously turn into a circle show cafe busking is done mostly in restaurants pubs bars and cafes musicians can frequently be found using this venue less commonly some other types of performers may do shows in this fashion such as balloon artists or caricature artists making a living on the piano bar principle is done in a range of genres including jazz rock and even light classical style perhaps one of the most famous of these is billy joel who rose to fame from working in piano bars his hit song piano man was written about a six month stint he did in 1972 at the executive room piano bar in los angeles a bottler is a british term that describes the person with the job of collecting the money a bottler may also be called the hat man or pitch man the term bottler came from a device old world performers used for collecting money it was made from the top half of a glass bottle it had a leather flap inserted in the bottle neck and a leather pouch attached it was designed to allow coins in but not allow them to be removed easily without being noticed by the jingling of the coins against the glass the first use of such contrivances was recorded by the famous punch and judy troupe of puppeteers in early victorian times bottling itself can be an art form and the difference between a good and a bad bottler can be crucial to the amount of money earned on a pitch a good bottler is able to encourage audience members to give money while at the same time smoothing over the potential sense of vulgarity of this request with jokes repartees and comedic routines a bottler usually gets a cut of the money made on the pitch prior to the 20th century it was common for buskers to use a trained monkey as a bottler that practice has diminished due to animal control laws but as tribute to the monkey s service there is a device known as monkey stick which buskers use to get attention a monkey stick is a long stick with bottle caps or small cymbals attached such that they make an attention getting noise when shaken it is frequently topped by a small monkey doll or figurine location can be the key an act that might make money at one place and time may not work at all in another setting popular busking spots tend to be public places with large volumes of pedestrian traffic high visibility low background noise and as few elements of interference as possible good locations may include tourist spots popular parks entertainment districts including lots of restaurants cafes bars and pubs and theaters subways and bus stops outside the entrances to large concerts and sporting events almost any plaza or town square as well as zócalos in latin america and piazzas and in other regions other places include shopping malls strip malls and outside of supermarkets and flea markets although permission is usually required from management for these in her documentary movie and book underground harmonies music and politics in the subways of new york susie j tanenbaum examines how the old adage music hath charms to soothe the savage breast plays out in regards to busking her sociological studies showed that in areas where buskers regularly perform crime rates tended to go down she also discovered that those with higher education tended to appreciate and support buskers more than those of lesser learning some cities are encouraging buskers because they can be a tonic to the stresses of shopping and commuting and can be an influence which is entertaining and beneficial for all some cities give preference to approved buskers in certain areas and even publish schedules of performances in the usa they have to be careful that such things are not exclusionary judgemental or discretionary in the united states there has been a rebirth of this art form as the new millennium has started buskers are found at many locations in new orleans all over the place in new york around central park washington square and the subway systems in san francisco at fisherman s wharf area market street union square and the cable car turnarounds and bart stations in washington dc around the transit centers in los angeles around venice beach the santa monica third street promenade and the hollywood area in chicago on maxwell street and many other locations throughout the us busking is still quite common in scotland ireland and england with musicians and other street performers of varying talent levels these performers have not always been called buskers the term busking was first noted in the english language around the middle 1860s in great britain the word busk comes from the spanish root word buscar meaning to seek buskers are literally seeking fame and fortune the spanish word buscar in turn evolved from the latin buskin a buskins were ornamental roman sandals which were worn on celebration days in obsolete french it evolved to busquer for seek prowl and was generally used to describe prostitutes in italian it evolved to buscare which meant procure gain and in italy buskers are called buscarsi or more simply buskers around the middle 1800s japanese chindonya started to be seen using their skills for advertising and these street performers are still occasionally seen in japan from the renaissance to the early 1900s busking was called minstrelsy in america europe and other english speaking lands in medieval france buskers were known by the terms troubadour and jongleurs in northern france they were known as trouveres in old german buskers were known as minnesingers and spielleute the term busk is also used in music when a musician has to play something quickly from scratch by ear or at sight as

in public places for gratuities in every major culture in the world dating back to antiquity this art form was the most common means of employment for entertainers before the advent of recording and personal electronics prior to that a living human being had to produce any music or entertainment save for a few mechanical devices such as the barrel organ the music box and the piano roll organ grinders were commonly found busking in the old days busking is common among the gypsies also known as the romani people mentions of gypsy music dancers and fortune tellers are found in all forms of song poetry prose and lore the roma brought the word busking to england by way of their travels along the mediterranean coast to spain and the atlantic ocean and then up north to england and the rest of europe in the us medicine shows proliferated in the 1800s they were traveling vendors selling elixirs and potions to improve the health they would often employ entertainment acts as a way of making the clients feel better the people would often associate this feeling of well being with the products sold after these performances they would pass the hat one man bands are buskers who perform a variety of instruments simultaneously one man bands proliferated in urban areas in the 1800s and early 1900s now days most modern day one man bands use karaoke or midi for backup folk music has always been a dominant presence in the busking scene cafe restaurant bar and pub busking is a mainstay of this art form two of the more famous folk singers are woody guthrie and joan baez the delta bluesmen were mostly itinerant musicians emanating from the mississippi delta region of the usa around the early 1920s and on the counterculture of the hippies of the 1960s occasionally staged be ins which resembled some present day busker festivals bands and performers would gather at public places and perform for free passing the hat to make money the san francisco bay area was at the epicenter of this movement be ins were staged at golden gate park and san jose s bee stadium and other venues some of the bands that performed in this manner were janis joplin with big brother and the holding company the grateful dead jefferson airplane quicksilver messenger service country joe and the fish moby grape and jimi hendrix the hedonistic pursuits of the hippies including the controversial free love and illegal drug use tainted the image of busking especially among the religious right christmas caroling can also be a form of busking as wassailing included singing for alms wassail or some other form of refreshment such as figgy pudding in ireland the traditional wren boys and in england morris dancing can be considered part of the busking tradition in the 2000s some performers have begun cyber busking artists post work or performances on the internet for people to download or stream and if people like it they make a donation using paypal some people stereotype buskers as being unemployed homeless or beggars most buskers are not and these terms are normally derogatory when referring to a busker some people will heckle buskers and stigmatize them as such regardless of their social status conflicts and fights over pitch can and do happen career buskers may try to maintain a right of pitch over others generally it is considered first come first served some buskers will send a person ahead of them to fend others off a pitch until they arrive this practice is known as squatting and is greatly looked down upon by other buskers at times a compromise may be reached between competing buskers and a pitch will be shared on a rotational basis beggars have been known to congregate around buskers trying to intercept those patrons who want to pay the busker for their services and convert the donation to themselves the buskers refer to these types as spongers beggars may also try to extort money from buskers by being obnoxious and harassing people until the busker pays them to go away buskers may find themselves targeted by thieves due to the very open and public nature of their craft buskers may have their earnings instruments or props stolen one particular technique that thieves use against buskers is to pretend to make a donation while actually taking money out instead a practice known as dipping or skimming george burns described his days as a youthful busker this way the first recorded instance of laws affecting buskers were in ancient rome in 462 bc the law of the twelve tables made it a crime to sing about or make parodies of the government or its officials in public places the penalty was death louis the pious excluded histriones and scurrae which included all entertainers without noble protection from the privilege of justice in 1530 henry viii ordered the licensing of minstrels players fortune tellers pardoners and fencers as well as beggars who could not work if they did not obey they could be whipped on two consecutive days in the united states under constitutional law and most european common law the protection of artistic free speech extends to busking in the usa and most places the designated places for free speech behavior are the public parks streets sidewalks thoroughfares and town squares or plazas under certain circumstances even private property may be open to buskers particularly if it is open to the general public and busking does not interfere with its function and management allows it or other forms of free speech behaviors or has a history of doing so in great britain free speech and busking can be regulated some towns in the british isles limit the licenses issued to bagpipers because of the volume and difficulty of the instrument places requiring licenses for buskers also often require auditions of anyone applying for a busking license many places require a special permit to use electronically amplified sound and have limits on the volume of amplified sound some venues that do not regulate busking may still ask performers to abide by voluntary rules while there is no universal code of conduct for buskers there are common law practices to which buskers must conform to most jurisdictions have corresponding statutory law it is common law that buskers or others should not impede pedestrian traffic flow block or otherwise obstruct entrances or exits or do things that endanger the public it is common law that any disturbing or noisy behaviors may not be conducted after certain hours in the night these curfew limitations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction it is common law that performing blue is generally prohibited unless performing for an adults only environment such as in a bar or pub in most english speaking countries it is common law that unless invited to do so busking for a captive audience where people cannot move away is generally not acceptable in some locations like the london and new york subway platforms preference is given to approved buskers but performing on the trains is not allowed throughout the rest of world busking on public transport may be commonplace in the us free speech is considered an essential and absolute civil right of every individual the only exceptions to this are sedition as defined by the smith act public displays of pornography obscenity and criminal behavior such as fraud or defamation if two or more persons conspire to violate a persons civil rights they are violating federal law it is also a violation of federal law if an officer of the law violates a persons civil rights under the color of the law it is the duty of all police officers to protect and preserve the constitution and these civil rights in the united states there have been numerous legal cases about regulations and laws that have decided the rights of buskers to perform in public most of these laws and regulations have been found to be unconstitutional when challenged in the usa about the only reasons that can be used to regulate or ban busking behavior are public safety issues and noise issues in certain areas that require silence like hospital zones around churches funeral homes cemeteries and transport terminals where announcements need to be heard such laws must be narrowly tailored to eliminate only the perceived evils by limiting the time place and manner that busking may be practiced they must also leave open reasonable alternative venues in the us laws regulating or banning busking must be applied evenly to all forms of free speech busking cannot be prohibited in an area where other forms of free speech are not prohibited for example if busking is regulated or banned but people are allowed to conduct free speech behavior for pickets protests religious political educational sports commercial or other purposes then the law is illegal in the usa any form of regulation on artistic free speech must not be judgmental and permits must not be so restrictive complex difficult or expensive to obtain that they inhibit free speech in the late 1920s and early 1930s busking had grown to be quite a controversial enterprise in new york the country was in the midst of a horrible economic depression and many people had turned to busking as a source of income buskers were everywhere and fights over pitches were alarmingly common between the buskers themselves and the buskers merchants and vendors out of frustration over the complaining fighting and violence mayor fiorello la guardia banned busking in new york on the grounds of safety issues regarding the escalating conflicts busking went on but on a much smaller scale if anybody complained about a busker at their discretion the police could order the busker to move on or could even arrest him or her in 1970 poet allen ginsburg challenged the constitutionality of this ban the ban was lifted in 1970 after being found to be unconstitutional by ny mayor lindsay in 1979 in goldstein v town of nantucket the town of

with igniting the manchester punk music scene inspiring many of the attendants to form their own groups sumner later said that he felt that the pistols destroyed the myth of being a pop star of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship inspired by the performance sumner and hook formed a band with their friend terry mason who had also attended the show sumner bought a guitar

car they sped off in august 1977 the band placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer stephen morris who had attended the same school as curtis was the sole respondent deborah curtis ian s wife stated that morris fitted perfectly with the other men and that with his addition warsaw became a complete family in order to avoid confusion with the london punk band warsaw

recorded another demo at pennine studios in december and played their first gig as joy division on 25 january 1978 at pip s in manchester joy division were approached by rca records to record a cover of nolan n f porter s keep on keepin on and was afforded recording time at a professional manchester studio in return joy division spent late march and april 1978 writing and rehearsing material during the stiff chiswick challenge concert on 14 april the group caught the attention of tony wilson and rob gretton who became supporters of the band curtis berated wilson for not putting the group on his defunct granada television show so it goes wilson responded that joy division would be the next band he would showcase on tv joy division spent the first week of may 1978 recording at manchester s arrow studios gretton became the band s manager soon after recording was completed the band were unhappy with the grapevine records head john anderson s insistence on adding sythesizer into the mix to soften the sound and asked to be dropped from the contract that they had recently signed with rca joy division made their recorded debut in june 1978 when the band self released their debut ep an ideal for living and a track of theirs at a later date was featured on the compilation album short circuit live at the electric circus in the melody maker review of the ep chris brazier said that it has the familiar rough hewn nature of home produced records but they re no mere drone vendors there are a lot of good ideas here and they could be a very interesting band by now seven months on the packaging which featured a drawing of a hitler youth member on the cover coupled with the nature of the band s name fueled speculation about their political affiliations while hook and sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time morris insisted that the group s obsession with nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during world war ii alive he argued that accusations of neo nazi sympathies merely provoked the band to keep on doing it because that s the kind of people we are in september 1978 joy division made their television performance debut on the local news show granada reports hosted by tony wilson later in the month joy division contributed two tracks recorded with producer martin hannett to the compilation double 7 ep a factory sample the first release by tony wilson s record label factory records joy division soon joined factory s roster after buying themselves out of the deal with rca rob gretton was made a partner in the label to represent the interests of the band on 27 december ian curtis suffered his first recognisable epileptic episode during the ride home after a show at the hope anchor in london curtis had a seizure and was taken to a hospital in spite of his illness joy division s career continued to progress curtis appeared on the front cover of the 13 january 1979 issue of the nme due to the persistence of music journalist paul morley that same month the band recorded their first radio session for bbc radio 1 dj john peel according to deborah curtis sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realization that ian s illness was something we would have to learn to accommodate in april 1979 the band began recording their debut album unknown pleasures at strawberry studios in stockport producer martin hannett contributed significantly to the final sound the band initially disliked the spacious atmospheric sound of the album which did not reflect their more aggressive live sound hook said in 2006 it definitely didn t turn out sounding the way i wanted it  but now i can see that martin did a good job on it  there s no two ways about it martin hannett created the joy division sound the album cover was designed by peter saville who would go on to provide artwork for future joy division releases unknown pleasures was released in june and sold through its initial pressing of 10 000 copies tony wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a revolutionary force that operated outside of the major record label system reviewing the album for melody maker writer jon savage called unknown pleasures an opaque manifesto and declared the twentieth century is difficult most people prefer to go back and nostalgize oh boy joy division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future perhaps you can t ask for much more indeed unknown pleasures may very well be one of the best white english debut lps of the year joy division performed on granada tv again in july 1979 and made their only nationwide tv appearance in september on bbc2 s something else they supported the buzzcocks in a 24 venue uk tour that began that october which allowed the band to quit their regular jobs the non album single transmission was released in november joy division s burgeoning success drew a devoted following nicknamed the cult with no name who were stereotyped as intense young men dressed in gray overcoats in january 1980 joy division set out on a european tour while the tour was difficult curtis only experienced two grand mal seizures in the two months preceding the tour s final date with martin hannett again producing the band recorded their second album closer in march at london s britannia row studios march also saw the release of the licht und blindheit single on the small french label sordide sentimental lack of sleep and long hours destabilised curtis s epilepsy and his seizures became almost uncontrollable curtis would often have seizures during shows which left him feeling ashamed and depressed while the band was concerned about their singer audience members on occasion thought his behaviour was part of the show on 7 april curtis attempted suicide by overdosing on phenobarbitone the next evening joy division was set to play a gig at the derby hall in bury with curtis recovering it was decided that the band would play a combined set with alan hempstall of crispy ambulance and simon topping of a certain ratio filling in on vocals for the first few songs curtis came onstage to perform for part of the set when topping came back out to finish the set for curtis some in the audience started throwing bottles at the stage gretton leapt into the crowd and a riot ensued several april gigs were cancelled due to the continuing ill health of curtis but the band filmed a promotional video for the forthcoming love will tear us apart single that month the band played what would be their final show at the university of birmingham s great hall on 2 may joy division were due to begin their first american tour in may 1980 while curtis had expressed a desire to take time off to a few acquaintances he feigned excitement about the tour around the band because he did not want to disappoint his band mates or factory records at the time curtis s relationship with his wife deborah curtis was collapsing contributing factors were his ill health her being mostly excluded from his life with the band and his relationship with a young belgian woman named annik honoré whom he had met on european tour the evening before joy division were to embark on the american tour curtis returned to his home in macclesfield in order to talk to his estranged wife he asked her to drop the divorce suit she had filed later he told her to leave him alone in the house until he caught his train to manchester the next morning early on the morning of 18 may 1980 curtis hanged himself in his kitchen deborah curtis discovered his body when she returned around midday tony wilson said in 2005 i think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen  we all completely underestimated the danger we didn t take it seriously that s how stupid we were curtis s suicide made for instant myth in music critic simon reynolds s words jon savage wrote in his obituary for curtis in melody maker now no one will remember what his work with joy division was like when he was alive it will be perceived as tragic rather than courageous in june 1980 the posthumous single love will tear us apart was released which hit number thirteen on the british singles chart in july 1980 closer finally came out peaking at number six on the british album chart nme reviewer charles shaar murray wrote closer is as magnificent a memorial as any post presley popular musician could have the members of joy division had made a pact long before curtis s death that should any member leave the remaining members would change the name of the group eventually renaming themselves new order the band was reborn as a three piece with sumner assuming vocal duties the group later recruited morris s girlfriend gillian gilbert to round out the lineup as keyboardist and second guitarist new order s first single the 1981 release ceremony featured the last two songs written with ian curtis while the group struggled in its early years to escape the shadow of joy division new order eventually went on to much greater commercial success than their predecessor band further joy division material has been released since the band s demise still a compilation of live tracks and rare recordings was issued in 1981 factory put out the substance compilation in 1988 which included several out of print singles another compilation permanent was released in 1995 by london records which had acquired the joy division catalogue after factory records went bankrupt in 1992 a comprehensive box set heart and soul came out in 1997 joy division took time to develop their sound as warsaw the band played fairly undistinguished punk inflected hard rock critic simon reynolds asserted that joy division s originality really became apparent as the songs got slower the group s music took on a sparse quality in reynolds s description peter hook s bass carried the melody bernard sumner s guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group s sound with dense riffage and steve morris s drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater sumner described the band s characteristic sound in 1994 it came out naturally i m more rhythm and chords and hooky was melody he used to play high lead bass because i liked my guitar to sound distorted and the amplifier i had would only work when it was at full volume when hooky played low he couldn t hear himself steve has his own style which is different to other drummers to me a drummer in the band is the clock but steve wouldn t be the clock because he s passive he would follow the rhythm of the band which gave us our own edge over time ian curtis began to sing in a low baritone voice which often drew comparisons to jim morrison of the doors sumner acted as the unofficial musical director of the band a role that he carried over into new order while sumner was the group s primary guitarist curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows curtis hated playing guitar but the band insisted he do so sumner said he played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting because no one else would play like ian during the recording sessions for closer sumner began using self built synthesizers and hook used a six string bass for more melody producer martin hannett dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying joy division s eerie spatiality hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to utilise studio technology to create sonic space the producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group s records hannett said were a gift to a producer because they didn t have a clue they didn t argue hannett demanded clean and clear sound separation not only for individual instruments but even for individual pieces of morris s drumkit morris recalled typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles he d get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed through of sound ian curtis was the group s sole lyricist curtis would write frantically when the mood took him he would then listen to the band s music and used the lyrics that were most appropriate words and images such as coldness pressure darkness crisis failure collapse loss of control reoccur in his songs in 1979 nme journalist paul rambali wrote the themes of joy division s music are sorrowful painful and sometimes deeply sad the band refused to explain their lyrics to the press or print the words on lyrics sheets curtis told the fanzine printed noise we haven t got a message really the lyrics are open to interpretation they re multidimensional you can read into them what you like the other band members later admitted they paid little attention to what curtis was writing deborah curtis recalled that only with the release of closer did many who were close to the singer realise is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics the surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in curtis s lyrics this sounds awful but it was only after ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics morris said in 2007 you d find yourself thinking oh my god i missed this one because i d look at ian s lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else i never believed he was writing about himself looking back how could i have been so bleedin stupid of course he was writing about himself but i didn t go in and grab him and ask what s up i have to live with that in contrast to the sound of their studio recordings joy division typically played loud and aggressively during live performances the band were unhappy with hannett s mixing of unknown pleasures which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound according to sumner the music was loud and heavy and we felt that martin had toned it down especially with the guitars in concert the group interacted little with the crowd paul morley wrote uring a joy division set outside of the songs you ll be lucky to hear more than two or three words hello and goodbye no introductions no promotion while singing curtis would often perform what was referred to as his dead fly dance where the singer s arms would start flying in semicircular hypnotic curve simon reynolds noted that curtis s dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy live performances became problematic for joy division due to curtis s condition sumner later said we didn t have flashing lights but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him he d go off in a trance for a bit then he d lose it and have a fit we d have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing room where he d cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him despite their short career and cult status joy division have exerted a wide reaching influence john bush of allmusic argues that joy division became the first band in the post punk movement by emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the 80s the band s dark and gloomy sound which martin hannett described in 1979 as dancing music with gothic overtones presaged the gothic rock genre while the term gothic originally described a doomy atmosphere in music of the late 1970s the term was soon applied to specific bands like bauhaus that followed in joy division s wake standard musical fixtures of early gothic rock bands included high pitched post joy division basslines usurp the melodic role and vocals that were either near operatic and teutonic or deep droning alloys of jim morrison and ian curtis joy division has influenced bands ranging from contemporaries u2 and the cure to post punk revival artists such as interpol bloc party and editors u2 frontman bono stated that his group worshipped joy division the singer said in the band s 2006 autobiography u2 by u2 it would be harder to find a darker place in music than joy division their name their lyrics and their singer were as big a black cloud as you could find in the sky and yet i sensed the pursuit of god or light or reason a reason to be with joy division you felt from this singer beauty was truth and truth was beauty and theirs was a search for both artists including electronica performer moby and red hot chili peppers guitarist john frusciante have described their appreciation for joy division s music and the influence it has had on their own material in 2005 joy division were inducted along with new order into the uk music hall of fame two biopics have been released that dramatise joy division on film 24 hour party people presented a somewhat fictionalised account of the rise and fall of factory records in which the members of joy division served as supporting characters tony wilson said of the film it s all true it s all not true it s not a fucking documentary insisting that whenever possible during the production of the film he favoured the myth over the truth the 2007 film control directed by anton corbijn is a biography of ian curtis that uses deborah curtis s biography of her late husband touching from a distance as its basis others consulted for the picture included tony wilson and new order who scored the film control had its international premiere on the opening night of director s fortnight at the 2007 cannes film festival where it was critically well received the same year grant gee directed a documentary about the band simply entitled joy division 
harry partch was an american composer and instrument creator he was one of the first twentieth century composers to work extensively and systematically with microtonal scales writing much of his music for custom made instruments that he built himself tuned in 11 limit just intonation partch was born on june 24 1901 in oakland california soon after his parents both presbyterian missionaries fled the boxer rebellion in china he spent his childhood in small remote towns in arizona and new mexico where he heard and sang songs in mandarin spanish and american indian languages partch was sterile probably due to childhood mumps and most of his loving relationships were with men as a child he learned to play the clarinet harmonium viola piano and guitar he began to compose at an early age using the equal tempered chromatic scale the tuning system most common in western music however partch grew frustrated with what he felt were imperfections of the standard system of musical tuning believing that this system was unsuitable for reflecting the subtle melodic contours of dramatic speech and as a result he burned all of his early works interested in the potential musicality of speech partch invented and constructed instruments that could underscore the intoning voice and he developed musical notations that accurately and practically instructed players as to how to play the instruments his first such instrument was the monophone later known as the adapted viola partch secured a grant that allowed him to go to london to study the history of tuning systems and text setting while there he met the poet william butler yeats with the intention of gaining yeats permission to write an opera based on the poet s translation of sophocles oedipus the king in his opera partch transcribed the inflections of actors from the abbey theatre reciting lines from sophocles play and partch performed this music on his monophone while intoning by the rivers of babylon yeats responded enthusiastically saying a play done entirely in this way with this wonderful instrument and with this type of music might really be sensational and he gave partch s idea his blessing partch then set out to build more instruments with which to realize his burgeoning opera however after his grant money ran out he was forced to return to the u s which was at the height of the depression there he lived as a hobo traveling around on trains and taking casual work where he could find it he continued in this way for ten years chronicling his experiences in a journal named bitter music the entries frequently included overheard bits of everyday vernacular speech wherein partch transcribed the speaker s pitches on musical staves this technique which had been used earlier by the florentine camerata berlioz mussorgsky debussy schoenberg leoš janáček and others and would be later used by steve reich was to become a standard approach to vocal scoring in partch s work in 1941 partch wrote barstow a work whose text comes from eight pieces of graffiti partch had spotted on a highway railing in barstow california the piece originally for voice and guitar was transcribed several times throughout the composer s life as his collection of instruments grew in 1943 after receiving a grant from the guggenheim foundation partch was able to dedicate more time to music he returned to his oedipus project although the executors of yeats estate refused to grant him permission to use yeats translation and he had to make his own while living briefly in ithaca new york he began work on us highball a musical evocation of riding the rails as a depression era hobo in 1949 a book partch had been working on since 1923 was eventually published as genesis of a music it is an account of his own music with discussions of music theory and music instrument design today it is considered a standard text of microtonal music theory and takes his concept of corporeality the fusion of all art forms with the body as its central focus he went on to write the dance satire the bewitched and revelation in the courthouse park a work based in large part on euripides the bacchae delusion of the fury is considered by some as his greatest work partch is famous for his 43 tone scale even though he used many different scales in his work and the number of divisions is theoretically infinite partch created and maintained his own record label gate 5 to release recordings of his works and generate income towards the end of his life columbia records made recordings of some of his works including delusion of the fury which helped increase public attention to his work he remains a somewhat obscure figure but is well known to experimental musicians and instrument builders and he is considered by many to be one of the most significant composers of the 20th century in 1974 he was inducted into the hall of fame of the percussive arts society a music service organization promoting percussion education research performance and appreciation throughout the world partch died on september 3 1974 in san diego california of a heart attack in 2004 u s highball was selected by the library of congress national recording preservation board as culturally historically or aesthetically significant harry partch s desire to use a different system of tuning inspired him to modify existing instruments and create new ones he was in his own words a philosophic music man seduced into carpentry his adapted instruments include the adapted viola and three adapted guitars a guitar with the equal tempered frets replaced by a complex system of justly tuned frets a guitar tuned in octaves or 2 1 s played by moving a pyrex rod along the strings much like a slide guitar and a 10 string fretless guitar played in a similar manner to his other fretless guitar but with a wildly different tuning he re tuned the reeds of several reed organs and labeled the keys with a color code the first one was called the ptolemy in tribute to the ancient music theorist claudius ptolemaeus whose musical scales included ratios of the 11 limit as partch s did the others were called chromelodeons a portmanteau of chrome and melodeon partch also designed and built many instruments from raw materials in 1990 dean drummond s newband became custodians of the original harry partch instrument collection and the group frequently performs with and commissions new pieces for partch s instruments the instruments have been housed in the harry partch instrumentarium at montclair state university in montclair new jersey since 1999 in 2004 the instruments crossed campus into the newly constructed alexander kasser theater which provides a large studio space in the basement concerts by newband and msu s harry partch ensemble may be viewed several times a year in this concert hall many people have duplicated partial sets of partch instruments including john schneider director of microfest his west coast ensemble includes replicas of the kithara cloud chamber bowls adapted guitars adapted viola diamond marimba bass marimba chromelodeon and two harmonic canons he was an uncle of the late cartoonist virgil franklin partch 
the modern japanese music scene includes a wide array of performers in distinct styles both traditional and modern ranging from rock electro punk folk metal reggae salsa and tango to country music and hip hop local music often appears at karaoke venues which is on lease from the record labels the old japanese music has no specific beat and is calm the music is improvised most of the time the word for music in japanese is 音楽 combining the kanji 音 with the kanji 楽 two of the oldest forms of traditional japanese music are shōmyō or buddhist chanting and gagaku or orchestral court music both of which date to the nara and heian periods gagaku is a type of classical music that has been performed at the imperial court since the heian period kagurauta azumaasobi and yamatouta are relatively indigenous repertories tōgaku and komagaku originated from the chinese tang dynasty via the korean peninsula in addition gagaku is divided into kangen and bugaku originating as early as the 19th century are honkyoku these are solo shakuhachi pieces played by mendicant fuke sect priests of zen buddhism these priests called komusō played honkyoku for alms and enlightenment the fuke sect ceased to exist in the 19th century but a verbal and written lineage of many honkyoku continues today though this music is now often practiced in a concert or performance setting the samurai often listened to and performed in these musical activities in their practices of enriching their lives and understanding musical theater also developed in japan from an early age noh or nō arose out of various more popular traditions and by the 14th century had developed into a highly refined art it was brought to its peak by kan ami and zeami in particular zeami provided the core of the noh repertory and authored many treatises on the secrets of the noh tradition another form of japanese theater is the puppet theater often known as bunraku this traditional puppet theater also has roots in popular traditions and flourished especially during chonin in the edo period it is usually accompanied by recitation accompanied by shamisen music during the edo period actors performed the lively and popular kabuki theater kabuki which could feature anything from historical plays to dance plays was often accompanied by nagauta style of singing and shamisen performance the biwa a form of short necked lute was played by a group of itinerant performers who used it to accompany stories the most famous of these stories is the tale of the heike a 19th century history of the triumph of the minamoto clan over the taira biwa hōshi began to organize themselves into a guild like association for visually impaired men as early as the thirteenth century this guild eventually controlled a large portion of the musical culture of japan in addition numerous smaller groups of itinerant blind musicians were formed especially in the kyushu area these musicians known as mōsō toured their local areas and performed a variety of religious and semi religious texts to purify households and bring about good health and good luck they also maintained a repertory of secular genres the biwa that they played was considerably smaller than the heike biwa played by the biwa hōshi lafcadio hearn related in his book kwaidan stories and studies of strange things mimi nashi hoichi a japanese ghost story about a blind biwa hōshi who performs the tale of the heike blind women known as goze also toured the land since the medieval era singing songs and playing accompanying music on a lap drum from the seventeenth century they often played the koto or the shamisen goze organizations sprung up throughout the land and existed until recently in what is today niigata prefecture the taiko is a japanese drum that comes in various sizes and is used to play a variety of musical genres it has become particularly popular in recent years as the central instrument of percussion ensembles whose repertory is based on a variety of folk and festival music of the past such taiko music is played by large drum ensembles called kumi daiko its origins are uncertain but can be sketched out as far back as the 6th and 7th centuries when a clay figure of a drummer indicates its existence china influences followed but the instrument and its music remained uniquely japanese taiko drums during this period were used during battle to intimidate the enemy and to communicate commands taiko continue to be used in the religious music of buddhism and shintō in the past players were holy men who played only at special occasions and in small groups but in time secular men also played the taiko in semi religious festivals such as the bon dance modern ensemble taiko is said to have been invented by daihachi oguchi in 1951 a jazz drummer oguchi incorporated his musical background into large ensembles which he had also designed his energetic style made his group popular throughout japan and made the hokuriku region a center for taiko music musicians to arise from this wave of popularity included sukeroku daiko and his bandmate seido kobayashi 1969 saw a group called za ondekoza founded by tagayasu den za ondekoza gathered together young performers who innovated a new roots revival version of taiko which was used as a way of life in communal lifestyles during the 1970s the japanese government allocated funds to preserve japanese culture and many community taiko groups were formed later in the century taiko groups spread across the world especially to the united states the video game taiko drum master is based around taiko one example of a modern taiko band is gocoo japanese folk songs can be grouped and classified in many ways but it is often convenient to think of four main categories work songs religious songs songs used for gatherings such as weddings funerals and festivals and children s songs in min yō singers are typically accompanied by the three stringed lute known as the shamisen taiko drums and a bamboo flute called shakuhachi other instruments that could accompany are a transverse flute known as the shinobue a bell known as kane a hand drum called the tsuzumi and or a 13 stringed zither known as the koto in okinawa the main instrument is the sanshin these are traditional japanese instruments but modern instrumentation such as electric guitars and synthesizers is also used in this day and age when enka singers cover traditional min yō songs terms often heard when speaking about min yō are ondo bushi bon uta and komori uta an ondo generally describes any folk song with a distinctive swing that may be heard as 2 4 time rhythm the typical folk song heard at obon festival dances will most likely be an ondo a fushi is a song with a distinctive melody its very name which is pronounced bushi in compounds means melody or rhythm the word is rarely used on its own but is usually prefixed by a term referring to occupation location personal name or the like bon uta as the name describes are songs for obon the lantern festival of the dead komori uta are children s lullabies the names of min yo songs often include descriptive term usually at the end for example tokyo ondo kushimoto bushi hokkai bon uta and itsuki no komoriuta many of these songs include extra stress on certain syllables as well as pitched shouts kakegoe are generally shouts of cheer but in min yō they are often included as parts of choruses there are many kakegoe though they vary from region to region in okinawa min yō for example one will hear the common ha iya sasa in mainland japan however one will be more likely to hear a yoisho  sate or a sore others are a donto koi and dokoisho recently a guild based system known as the iemoto system has been applied to some forms of min yō it is called this system was originally developed for transmitting classical genres such as nagauta shakuhachi or koto music but since it proved profitable to teachers and was supported by students who wished to obtain certificates of proficiency and artist s names continues to spread to genres such as min yō tsugaru jamisen and other forms of music that were traditionally transmitted more informally today some min yō are passed on in such pseudo family organizations and long apprenticeships are common see also ainu music of north japan umui religious songs shima uta dance songs and especially katcharsee lively celebratory music were all popular okinawan folk music varies from mainland japanese folk music in several ways first okinawan folk music is often accompanied by the sanshin whereas in mainland japan the shamisen accompanies instead other okinawan instruments include the sanba and a sharp bird whistle second tonality a pentatonic scale which coincides with the major pentatonic scale of western musical disciplines is often heard in min yō from the main islands of japan in this pentatonic scale the subdominant and leading tone are omitted resulting in a musical scale with no half steps between each note okinawan min yō however is characterized by scales that include the half steps omitted in the aforementioned pentatonic scale when analyzed in the western discipline of music in fact the most common scale used in okinawan min yō includes scale degrees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 after the meiji restoration introduced western musical instruction a bureaucrat named izawa shuji compiled songs like auld lang syne and commissioned songs using a pentatonic melody western music especially military marches soon became popular in japan two major forms of music that developed during this period were shoka which was composed to bring western music to schools and gunka which are military marches with some japanese elements as japan moved towards representative democracy in the late 19th century leaders hired singers to sell copies of songs that aired their messages since the leaders themselves were usually prohibited from speaking in public after ryūkōka made waves across the country this developed into a form of ballad called enka which became quite popular in the postwar period though its popularity has waned since the 1970s and enjoys little favour with contemporary youth famous enka singers include hibari misora and ikuzo yoshi also at the end of the 19th century an osakan form of streetcorner singing became popular this was called rōkyoku this included the first two japanese stars yoshida naramaru and tochuken kumoemon westernized pop music is called kayōkyoku which is said to have and first appeared in a dramatization of resurrection by tolstoy sung by sumako matsui the song became a hit among enka singers and was one of the first major best selling records in japan kayōkyoku became a major industry especially after the arrival of superstar misora hibari later in the 1950s tango and other kinds of latin music especially cuban music became very popular in japan a distinctively japanese form of tango called dodompa also developed kayōkyoku became associated entirely with traditional japanese structures while more western style music was called japanese pops in the 1960s japanese bands imitated the beatles bob dylan and the rolling stones along with other appalachian folk music psychedelic rock mod and similar genres this was called group sounds john lennon became one of most favourite western musicians in japan since then j pop have become some of the best selling forms of music and are often used in films japanese animation television advertisement and dramatic programming the rise of disposable pop has been linked with the popularity of karaoke leading to much criticism that it is consumerist and shallow for example kazufumi miyazawa of the boom claims i hate that buy listen and throw away and sing at a karaoke bar mentality electronic pop music in japan became a successful commodity with the technopop craze of the late 70s and 80s beginning with yellow magic orchestra and solo albums of ryuichi sakamoto and haruomi hosono in 1978 before hitting popularity in 79 80 influenced by disco impressionistic and 20th century classical composition jazz fusion pop new wave and technopop artists such as kraftwerk and telex these artists were commercial yet uncompromising ryuichi sakamoto claims that to me making pop music is not a compromise because i enjoy doing it the artists that fall under the banner of technopop in japan are as loose as those that do so in the west thus new wave bands such as p model and the plastics fall under the category alongside the symphonic techno arrangements of yellow magic orchestra the popularity of this music meant that many popular artists of the 70s that previously were known for acoustic music turned to techno production such as taeko onuki and akiko yano and idol producers began employing electronic arrangements for new singers in the 80s today newer artists such as polysics pay explicit homage to this era of japanese popular music the late 90 s brought the arrival of many new artists and groups including hikaru utada kumi koda every little thing ayumi hamasaki and morning musume hikaru utada s debut album first love went on to be the highest selling album in japan with over 7 million copies sold whereas ayumi hamasaki became japan s top selling female and solo artist and morning musume remains one of the most well known girl groups in the japanese pop music industry western classical music has a strong presence in japan and the country is one of the most important markets for this music tradition with toru takemitsu being the best known also famous is the conductor seiji ozawa since 1999 the pianist fujiko hemming who plays liszt and chopin has been famous and her cds have sold millions of copies japan is also home to the world s leading wind band the tokyo kosei wind orchestra and the largest music competition of any kind the all japan band association national contest from the 1930s on jazz has had a strong presence in japan the country is an important market for the music and it is common that recordings no longer available in the united states are available in japan a number of japanese jazz musicians have achieved popularity abroad as well as at home musicians such as june and dan and sadao watanabe have a large fan base outside their native country lately club jazz or nu jazz has become popular with a growing number of young japanese native djs such as ryota nozaki the two brothers okino shuya and okino yoshihiro of kyoto jazz massive toshio matsuura and dj shundai matsuo creator of the popular monthly dj event creole in beppu japan as well as nu jazz artists sleepwalker grooveline and soil pimp sessions have brought great change to the traditional notions of jazz in japan today some of the newer and very interesting bands include ego wrappin and sakerock group sounds is a genre of japanese rock music that was popular in the mid to late 1960s the tigers was the most popular g s bands in the era later some of the members of the tigers the tempters and the spiders formed the first japanese supergroup pyg homegrown japanese country rock had developed by the late 1960s artists like happy end are considered to have virtually developed the genre during the 1970s it grew more popular the okinawan band champloose along with carol rc succession and shinji harada were especially famous and helped define the genre s sound in the 1980s the boøwy inspired alternative rock bands like shonen knife boredoms the pillows and tama little creatures as well as more mainstream bands as glay most influentially the 1980s spawned yellow magic orchestra which was inspired by developing electronic music led by haruomi hosono in 1980 huruoma and ry cooder an american musician collaborated on a rock album with shoukichi kina driving force behind the aforementioned okinawan band champloose they were followed by sandii the sunsetz who further mixed japanese and okinawan influences also during the 80 s japanese rock bands gave birth to the movement known as visual kei represented during its history by bands like buck tick x japan luna sea malice mizer and many others some of which experienced success in the recent years in the 90 s rock bands such as glay luna sea and l arc en ciel which are often considered visual kei or related to this genre as well as bands like b z and mr children achieved great commercial success some of them establishing marks in japanese music history while b z is the 1 best selling act in japanese music since oricon started to count followed by mr children glay was arguably the most massively popular band in the 90s in 1999 the band played for a crowd of 200 000 the most attended single concert ever held in japan though the rock scene in the 2000s is not as strong newer bands as bump of chicken remioromen uverworld and orange range which are considered rock bands although the latter also does hip hop have achieved success established bands as glay l arc en ciel b z and mr children also continue to top charts though b z and mr children are the only bands to maintain a high standards of their sales along the years japanese rock has a vibrant underground rock scene best known internationally for noise rock bands such as boredoms and melt banana as well as stoner rock bands such as boris and alternative acts such as shonen knife pizzicato five and the pillows more conventional indie rock artists such as eastern youth the band apart and number girl have found some mainstream success in japan but relatively little recognition outside of their home country early examples of punk rock no wave in japan include the ss the star club the stalin inu gaseneta lizard and friction and the blue hearts the early punk scene was immortalised on film by sogo ishii who directed the 1982 film burst city featuring a cast of punk bands musicians and also filmed videos for the stalin in the 80s hardcore bands such as g i s m gauze confuse lip cream and systematic death began appearing some incorporating crossover elements the independent scene also included a diverse number of alternative post punk new wave artists such as aburadako p model uchoten auto mod buck tick la ppisch guernica and yapoos g schmitt totsuzen danball and jagatara along with noise industrial bands such as hijokaidan and hanatarashi during the late nineties and early 2000s bands like hi standard hawaiian6 snail ramp garlic boys dir en grey husking bee nicotine and going steady brought japanese punk to new heights later examples of japanese alternative bands are ellegarden thee michelle gun elephant asian kung fu generation maximum the hormone gazette miyavi and sug another subgenre is characterized by highly technical yet dissonant instrumentals the vocal style runs the gamut from j pop style to incoherent screeching to traditional japanese style singing lyrics may be generally nonsensical and random their visual style also reflects this and may run to the extremes in visual kei bands this style seems to be a conscious rejection of the old japanese proverb the nail that sticks out will be hammered down when their culture prides itself on conformity and harmony these artists strive to create dissonance and attract the wrong kind of attention this is relatively new genre starting in the late 1990s and just now getting its voice heard notable bands in this subgenre include mucc and dir en grey japan is known for being a successful area for metal bands touring around the world and as a result many live albums are recorded in japan notable examples are judas priest s unleashed in the east and deep purple s made in japan the most popular genres of metal in japan are neo classical metal and power metal bands such as angra sonata arctica and skylark have had major success in japan japanese neo classical bands also had success among international neo classical fans with concerto moon and ark storm being the leading bands speed metal melodic death metal and doom metal also have followings many older japanese metal bands are speed metal due to the success of x japan extreme metal is usually treated as an underground form of music in japan notable acts are sabbat and sigh loudness is the most successful japanese heavy metal band outside of japan their 6th album lightning strikes peaked at 64 on the billboard 200 hip hop is a newer form of music on the japanese music scene many felt it was a trend that would immediately pass however the genre has lasted for many years and is still thriving in fact rappers in japan did not achieve the success of hip hop artists in other countries until the late 1980s this was mainly due to the music world s belief that japanese sentences were not capable of forming the rhyming effect that was contained in american rappers songs there is a certain well defined structure to the music industry called the pyramid structure of a music scene as ian condry notes viewing a music scene in terms of a pyramid provides a more nuanced understanding of how to interpret the significance of different levels and kinds of success the levels are as follows fans and potential artists performing artists recording artists major label artists and mega hit stars these different levels can be clearly seen at a genba or nightclub different families of rappers perform on stage a family is essentially a collection of rap groups that are usually headed by one of the more famous tokyo acts which also include a number of proteges they are important because they are the key to understanding stylistic differences between groups hip hop fans in the audience are the ones in control of the night club they are the judges who determine the winners in rap battles on stage an example of this can be seen with the battle between rap artists dabo and kan kan challenged dabo to a battle on stage while dabo was mid performance another important part of night clubs was displayed at this time it showed the openness of the scene and the fluidity of boundaries in clubs both artists did a cappella freestyle but in the end the audience showed their approval for dabo in the late 1980s roots bands like shang shang typhoon and the boom became popular okinawan roots bands like nenes and kina were also commercially and critically successful this led to the second wave of okinawan music led by the sudden success of rinkenband a new wave of bands followed including the comebacks of champluse and kina as led by kikusuimaru kawachiya very similar to kawachi ondo is tadamaru sakuragawa s goshu ondo see j ska other forms of music from indonesia jamaica and elsewhere were assimilated african soukous and latin music was popular as was jamaican reggae and ska exemplified by mute beat home grown and ska flames determinations and tokyo ska paradise orchestra when the first electronic games were sold they only had rudimentary sound chips with which to produce music as the technology advanced the quality of sound and music these game machines could produce increased dramatically the first game to take credit for its music was xevious also noteworthy for its deeply constructed stories though many games have had beautiful music to accompany their gameplay one of the most important games in the history of the video game music is dragon quest koichi sugiyama a composer who was known for his music for various anime and tv shows including cyborg 009 and a feature film of godzilla vs biollante got involved in the project out of the pure curiosity and proved that games can have serious soundtracks until his involvement music and sounds were often neglected in the development of video games and programmers with little musical knowledge were forced to write the soundtracks as well undaunted by technological limits sugiyama worked with only 8 part polyphony to create a soundtrack that would not tire the player despite hours and hours of gameplay another well known author of video game music is nobuo uematsu of mistwalker even uematsu s earlier compositions for the game series final fantasy on famicom are being arranged for full orchestral score in 2003 he even took his rock based tunes from their original midi format and created the black mages yasunori mitsuda is a highly known composer of such games as xenogears xenosaga episode i chrono cross and chrono trigger koji kondo the main composer for nintendo is also prominent on the japanese game music scene he is best known for the zelda and mario themes the techno trance music production group i ve sound has made a name for themselves first by making themes for eroge computer games and then by breaking into the anime scene by composing themes for them unlike others this group was able to find fans in other parts of the world through their eroge and anime themes today game soundtracks are sold on cd famous singers like hikaru utada sometimes sing songs for games as well and this is also seen as a way for singers to make a names for themselves 
the knife are a musical duo from sweden formed in 1999 the band consists of siblings karin dreijer andersson and olof dreijer who also run their own record company rabid records the group gained recognition when josé gonzález covered their song heartbeats on his 2003 album veneer the cover was used by sony in a commercial for bravia television sets and released as a single in early 2006 the group commented on this in a dagens nyheter article claiming that sony paid a large sum of money to use the song despite the group s anti commercial views they justified the transaction by citing their need for money to establish a record company the knife s song we share our mother s health from their album silent shout was featured by the itunes store as a free song of the week in late 2006 this song was also featured in the abc series ugly betty as well as an episode of csi ny in august 2007 heartbeats was featured on an episode of the hbo series entourage having never before performed live the knife went on tour in 2006 and after selling out shows worldwide a dvd of the tour was announced the dvd was released in sweden on november 8 2006 and is titled silent shout an audio visual experience silent shout was named the best album of 2006 by pitchfork media at the grammis awards in january 2007 the knife won in all six categories they were nominated in composer of the year music dvd of the year producer of the year pop group of the year album of the year and artist of the year again they did not attend the award ceremony in an interview during the silent shout tour olof announced that the band would be going on a three year hiatus during which he would resume work on previously started songs for coolof his solo dj project one of the group s distinguishing characteristics is their unwillingness to cooperate with the media or the mainstream music scene the group rarely makes public appearances most of their promotional photos feature the members wearing masks usually venetian masks and until recently they outright refused to perform live concerts the group has shown themselves in public wearing masks formed as birds beaks similar to those used by medieval doctors the knife won a grammis award as best pop group of the year 2003 but they boycotted the ceremony by sending two representatives of another artist group dressed as gorillas with the number 50 written on their costumes as a protest against male dominance in the music industry their album deep cuts was also nominated for a grammis as the best record of the year 2003 although that award went to the cardigans the knife have listed david lynch aki kaurismäki korean cinema trailer park boys donnie darko and doom as inspirations for their work in 2008 dreijer andersson announced that she would release a solo album under the name fever ray in march 2009 the album was digitally released in advance of this dreijer andersson appears as guest vocalist on olof dreijer appears on the nine inch nails remix album y34rz3r0r3m1x3d with a 14 minute remix of me i m not 2003 nöjesguiden s stockholm award music category

in electronics a vacuum tube electron tube thermionic valve or valve is a device used to amplify switch otherwise modify or create an electrical signal by controlling the movement of electrons in a low pressure space some special function vacuum tubes are filled with low pressure gas these are so called soft valves as distinct from the hard vacuum type which have the internal gas pressure reduced as far as possible almost all depend on the thermal emission of electrons hence thermionic vacuum tubes were critical to the development of electronic technology which drove the expansion and commercialization of radio broadcasting television radar sound reproduction large telephone networks analog and digital computers and industrial process control some of these applications pre dated electronics but it was the vacuum tube that made them widespread and practical for most purposes the vacuum tube has been replaced by solid state devices such as transistors and solid state diodes solid state devices last much longer are smaller more efficient more reliable and cheaper than equivalent vacuum tube devices however tubes are still used in specialized applications for engineering reasons as in high power radio frequency transmitters or for their aesthetic appeal as in audio amplification cathode ray tubes are still used as display devices in television sets video monitors and oscilloscopes although they are being replaced by lcds and other flat panel displays a specialized form of the electron tube the magnetron is the source of microwave energy in microwave ovens and some radar systems the klystron a powerful but narrow band radio frequency amplifier is commonly deployed by broadcasters as a high power uhf television transmitter a vacuum tube consists of electrodes in a vacuum in a insulating heat resistant envelope many tubes have glass envelopes though some types such as power tubes may have ceramic or metal envelopes the electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal on most tubes the leads are designed to plug into a tube socket for easy replacement the simplest vacuum tubes resemble incandescent light bulbs in that they have a filament sealed in a glass envelope which has been evacuated of all air when hot the filament releases electrons into the vacuum a process called thermionic emission the resulting negatively charged cloud of electrons is called a space charge these electrons will be drawn to a metal plate inside the envelope if the plate is positively charged relative to the filament the result is a flow of electrons from filament to plate this cannot work in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons this very simple example described can thus be seen to operate as a diode a device that conducts current only in one direction the vacuum tube diode conducts conventional current from plate to the filament this is the opposite direction to the flow of electrons vacuum tubes require a large temperature difference between the hot cathode and the cold anode because of this vacuum tubes are inherently power inefficient enclosing the tube within a heat retaining envelope of insulation would allow the entire tube to reach the same temperature resulting in electron emission from the anode that would counter the normal one way current because the tube requires a vacuum to operate convection cooling of the anode is typically not possible instead anode cooling occurs primarily through black body radiation and conduction of heat to the outer glass envelope via the anode mounting frame cold cathode tubes do exist but are used primarily in lighting systems where unidirectional power regulation is not the functional purpose of the tube the vacuum tube is a voltage controlled device with the relationship between the input and output circuits determined by a transconductance function the solid state device most closely analogous to the vacuum tube is the jfet although the vacuum tube typically operates at far higher voltage levels than the jfet the 19th century saw increasing research with evacuated tubes such as the geissler and crookes tubes scientists who experimented with such tubes included eugen goldstein nikola tesla johann wilhelm hittorf thomas edison and many others these tubes were mostly for specialized scientific applications or were novelties with the exception of the light bulb the groundwork laid by these scientists and inventors however was critical to the development of vacuum tube technology though the thermionic emission effect was originally reported in 1873 by frederick guthrie it is thomas edison s 1884 investigation of the edison effect that is more often mentioned edison patented what he found but he did not understand the underlying physics or the potential value of the discovery the english physicist john ambrose fleming worked as an engineering consultant for firms including edison telephone and the marconi company in 1904 as a result of experiments conducted on edison effect bulbs imported from the usa he developed a device he called an oscillation valve later known as the fleming valve it could be used as a rectifier of alternating current and as a radio wave detector in 1906 robert von lieben filed for a three electrode amplifying vacuum tube his invention included also a beam focusing electromagnet in 1907 lee de forest placed a bent wire serving as a screen later known as the grid electrode between the filament and plate electrode as the voltage applied to the grid was varied from negative to positive the number of electrons flowing from the filament to the plate would vary accordingly thus the grid was said to electrostatically control the plate current the resulting three electrode device was therefore an excellent and very sensitive amplifier of voltages deforest called his invention the audion in 1907 deforest filed for a three electrode version of the audion for use in radio communications the device is now known as the triode de forest s device was not strictly a vacuum tube but clearly depended for its action on ionisation of the relatively high levels of gas remaining after evacuation the de forest company in its audion leaflets warned against operation which might cause the vacuum to become too hard the finnish inventor eric tigerstedt significantly improved on the original triode design in 1914 while working on his sound on film process in berlin germany the first true vacuum triodes were the pliotrons developed by irving langmuir at the general electric research laboratory in 1915 langmuir was one of the first scientists to realize that a harder vacuum would improve the amplifying behaviour of the triode pliotrons were closely followed by the french r type which was in widespread use by the allied military by 1916 these two types were the first true vacuum tubes historically vacuum levels in production vacuum tubes typically ranged between 10 µpa to 10 npa the non linear operating characteristic of the triode caused early tube audio amplifiers to exhibit harmonic distortions at low volumes this is not to be confused with the overdrive that tube amplifiers exhibit at high volume levels to remedy the low volume distortion problem engineers plotted curves of the applied grid voltage and resulting plate currents and discovered that there was a range of relatively linear operation in order to use this range a negative voltage had to be applied to the grid to place the tube in the middle of the linear area with no signal applied this was called the idle condition and the plate current at this point the idle current today this current would be called the quiescent or standing current the controlling voltage was superimposed onto this fixed voltage resulting in linear swings of plate current for both positive and negative swings of the input voltage this concept was called grid bias when triodes were first used in radio transmitters and receivers it was found that they had a tendency to oscillate due to parasitic anode to grid capacitance many circuits were developed to reduce this problem but proved unsatisfactory over wide ranges of frequencies it was discovered that the addition of a second grid located between the control grid and the plate and called a screen grid could solve these problems a positive voltage slightly lower than the plate voltage was applied to it and the screen grid was bypassed to ground with a capacitor this arrangement decoupled the anode and the first grid completely eliminating the oscillation problem an additional side effect of this second grid is that the miller capacitance is also reduced which improves gain at high frequency this two grid tube is called a tetrode meaning four active electrodes however the tetrode has some new problems in any tube electrons strike the anode hard enough to knock out secondary electrons in a triode these electrons cannot reach the grid or cathode and are re captured by the anode but in a tetrode they can be captured by the second grid reducing the plate current and the amplification of the circuit since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons in the worst case particularly when the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage the plate current can actually go down with increasing plate voltage this is the tetrode kink another consequence of this effect is that under severe overload the current collected by the screen grid can cause it to overheat and melt destroying the tube again the solution was to add another grid called a suppressor grid this third grid was biased at either ground or cathode voltage and its negative voltage electrostatically suppressed the secondary electrons by repelling them back toward the anode this three grid tube is called a pentode meaning five electrodes frequency conversion can be accomplished by various methods in superheterodyne receivers tubes with 5 grids called pentagrid converters were generally used although alternatives such as using a combination of a triode with a hexode were also used even octodes have been used for frequency conversion the additional grids are either control grids with different signals applied to each one or screen grids in many designs a special grid acted as a second leaky plate to provide a built in oscillator which then coupled this signal with the incoming radio signal these signals create a single combined effect on the plate current of the tube circuit the heptode or pentagrid converter was the most common of these 6be6 is an example of a heptode to reduce the cost and complexity of radio equipment by 1940 it was common practice to combine more than one function or more than one set of elements in the bulb of a single tube the only constraint was where patents and other licencing considerations required the use of multiple tubes see british valve association for example the rca type 55 was a double diode triode used as a detector automatic gain control rectifier and audio preamp in early ac powered radios the same set of tubes often included the 53 dual triode audio output another early type of multi section tube the 6sn7 is a dual triode which for most purposes can perform the functions of two triode tubes while taking up half as much space and costing less the 12ax7 is a dual high gain triode widely used in guitar amplifiers audio preamps and instruments the invention of the 9 pin miniature tube base besides allowing the 12ax7 family also allowed many other multi section tubes such as the 6gh8 triode pentode along with a host of similar tubes the 6gh8 was quite popular in television receivers some color tv sets used exotic types like the 6jh8 which had two plates and beam deflection electrodes vacuum tubes used like this were designed for demodulation of synchronous signals an example of which is color demodulation for television receivers the desire to include many functions in one envelope resulted in the general electric compactron a typical unit the 6ag11 compactron tube contained two triodes and two diodes but many in the series had triple triodes an early example of multiple devices in one envelope was the loewe 3nf this 1920s device had 3 triodes in a single glass envelope together with all the fixed capacitors and resistors required to make a complete radio receiver as the loewe set had only one tubeholder it was able to substantially undercut the competition since in germany state tax was levied by the number of tubeholders however reliability was compromised and production costs for the tube were much greater loewe were to also offer the 2nf and the wg38 the beam power tube is usually a tetrode with the addition of beam forming electrodes which take the place of the suppressor grid these angled plates focus the electron stream onto certain spots on the anode which can withstand the heat generated by the impact of massive numbers of electrons while also providing pentode behavior the positioning of the elements in a beam power tube uses a design called critical distance geometry which minimizes the tetrode kink plate grid capacitance screen grid current and secondary emission effects from the anode thus increasing power conversion efficiency the control grid and screen grid are also wound with the same pitch or number of wires per inch aligning the grid wires also helps to reduce screen current which represents wasted energy this design helps to overcome some of the practical barriers to designing high power high efficiency power tubes 6l6 was the first popular beam power tube introduced by rca in 1936 corresponding tubes in europe were the kt66 kt77 and kt88 by gec variations of the 6l6 design are still widely used in guitar amplifiers making it one of the longest lived electronic device families in history similar design strategies are used in the construction of large ceramic power tetrodes used in radio transmitters some special purpose tubes are constructed with particular gases in the envelope for instance voltage regulator tubes contain various inert gases such as argon helium or neon and take advantage of the fact that these gases will ionize at predictable voltages the thyratron is a special purpose tube filled with low pressure gas or mercury some of which vaporizes like other tubes it contains a hot cathode and an anode but also a control electrode which behaves somewhat like the grid of a triode when the control electrode starts conduction the gas ionizes and the control electrode no longer can stop the current the tube latches into conduction removing plate voltage lets the gas de ionize restoring its non conductive state some thyratrons can carry relatively large currents for their physical size one example is the miniature type 2d21 often seen in 1950s jukeboxes as control switches for relays a cold cathode version of the thyratron which uses a pool of mercury for its cathode is called an ignitron it can switch thousands of amperes in its largest versions thyratrons containing hydrogen have a very consistent time delay between their turn on pulse and full conduction and have long been used in radar transmitters thyratrons behave much like silicon controlled rectifiers tubes usually have glass envelopes but metal fused quartz and ceramic are possible choices the first version of the 6l6 used a metal envelope sealed with glass beads while a glass disk fused to the metal was used in later versions metal and ceramic are used almost exclusively for power tubes above 2 kw dissipation the nuvistor is a tiny tube made only of metal and ceramic in some power tubes the metal envelope is also the anode 4cx800a is an external anode tube of this sort air is blown through an array of fins attached to the anode thus cooling it power tubes using this cooling scheme are available up to 150 kw dissipation above that level water or water vapor cooling are used the highest power tube currently available is the eimac 8974 a forced water cooled power tetrode capable of dissipating 1 5 megawatts a pair of 8974s is capable of producing 2 megawatts of audio power the 8974 is used only in military and commercial radio frequency installations the miniature vacuum tube is a development of the earlier devices which eliminated the bakelite base it was invented in 1938 miniature valves are smaller instead of the separate base the pins are fused in the glass base of the envelope this forces the sealing tip to the top of the envelope making valves smaller reduced the voltage that they could work at and also the power of the filament so the older style continued to be used for high power rectifiers valve amplifier output stages and certain transmitting tubes development continued and led to the sub miniature valve the acorn valve and valves in d i l packages batteries provided the voltages required by tubes in early radio sets as many as three different voltages were required using three different batteries the a batteries or lt battery provided the filament voltage these were often rechargeable lead acid type ranging from 2 to 12 volts with single double and triple cell batteries being most common because these batteries produced 2 v 4 v or 6 v tube heaters were designed to operate at those voltages in portable radios flashlight dry batteries were sometimes used the plate voltage was provided by b batteries or the ht supply or battery these were generally of dry cell construction containing many small 1 5 volt cells in series they typically came in ratings of 22 5 45 67 5 90 or 135 volts some sets used a grid bias battery or c batteries although many circuits used grid leak resistors voltage dividers or cathode bias to provide proper tube bias these batteries had very low drain replacement of batteries was a major cost of operation for early radio receiver users the development of the battery eliminator and later batteryless receivers operated by household power reduced operating costs and contributed to the growing popularity of radio a power supply using a transformer with several windings one or more rectifiers and large filter capacitors provided the required direct current voltages from the alternating current source as a cost reduction measure especially in high volume consumer receivers all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the ac supply and the plate voltage was derived from a half wave rectifier directly connected to the ac input eliminating the need for a heavy transformer while this limited the plate voltage that could be obtained the resulting supply was adequate for many purposes a filament tap on the rectifier tube provided the 6 volt low current supply needed for a dial light these radios could be operated on ac or dc the so called series string approach did have one safety defect the chassis of the receiver was connected to one side of the power supply presenting a shock hazard engineers reduced this hazard by enclosing the chassis in a plastic case making the back out of particle board and riveting the power cord chassis plug to the back so that consumers would not be able to power the radio while the chassis was accessible most consumer am radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit with the tube complement of 12ba6 12be6 12av6 35w4 and 50c5 giving these radios the nickname all american five or simply five tube radio tens of millions of such receivers were produced and they are quickly becoming collector s items it became common to use the filament to heat a separate electrode called the cathode and to use this cathode as the source of electron flow in the tube rather than the filament itself this minimized the introduction of hum when the filament was energized with alternating current in such tubes the filament is called a heater to distinguish it as an inactive element development of vacuum tubes that could use alternating current for the heater supply allowed elimination of one rectifier element the chief reliability problem of a tube is that the filament or cathode is slowly poisoned by atoms from other elements in the tube which damage its ability to emit electrons trapped gases or slow gas leaks can also damage the cathode or cause plate current runaway due to ionization of free gas molecules vacuum hardness and proper selection of construction materials are the major influences on tube lifetime depending on the material temperature and construction the surface material of the cathode may also diffuse onto other elements the resistive heaters that heat the cathodes may break in a manner similar to incandescent lamp filaments but rarely do since they operate at much lower temperatures than lamps the heater s failure mode due to its positive temperature coefficient is generally associated with the power up period as a result of the switch on current surge a negative temperature coefficient device such as a thermistor was sometimes incorporated in the equipment heater supply to compensate another important reliability problem is caused by air leakage into the tube usually oxygen in the air reacts chemically with the hot filament or cathode quickly ruining it designers developed tube designs that sealed reliably this was why most tubes were constructed of glass metal alloys and glasses had been developed for light bulbs that expanded and contracted in similar amounts as temperature changed these made it easy to construct an insulating envelope of glass while passing connection wires through the glass to the electrodes when a vacuum tube is overloaded or operated past its design dissipation its anode may glow red in consumer equipment a glowing plate is universally a sign of an overloaded tube however some large transmitting tubes are designed to operate with their anodes at red orange or in rare cases white heat the vacuum inside the envelope must be as perfect or hard as possible any gas atoms remaining might be ionized at operating voltages and will conduct electricity between the elements in an uncontrolled manner this can lead to erratic operation or even catastrophic destruction of the tube and associated circuitry unabsorbed free air sometimes ionizes and becomes visible as a pink purple glow discharge between the tube elements to prevent any remaining gases from remaining in a free state in the tube modern tubes are constructed with getters which are usually small circular troughs filled with metals that oxidize quickly with barium being the most common while the tube envelope is being evacuated the internal parts except the getter are heated by rf induction heating to extract any remaining gases from the metal the tube is then sealed and the getter is heated to a high temperature again by radio frequency induction heating this causes the material to evaporate absorbing reacting with any residual gases and usually leaving a silver colored metallic deposit on the inside of the envelope of the tube the getter continues to absorb any gas molecules that leak into the tube during its working life if a tube develops a crack in the envelope this deposit turns a white color when it reacts with atmospheric oxygen large transmitting and specialized tubes often use more exotic getter materials such as zirconium early gettered tubes used phosphorus based getters and these tubes are easily identifiable as the phosphorus leaves a characteristic orange or rainbow deposit on the glass the use of phosphorus was short lived and was quickly replaced by the superior barium getters unlike the barium getters the phosphorus did not absorb any further gases once it had fired large transmitting tubes have tungsten filaments containing a small trace of thorium a thin layer of thorium atoms forms on the outside of the wire when heated serving as an efficient source of electrons the thorium slowly evaporates from the wire surface while new thorium atoms diffuse to the surface to replace them such thoriated tungsten cathodes deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours the claimed record is held by an eimac power tetrode used in a los angeles radio station s transmitter which was removed from service after 80 000 hours of operation transmitting tubes are also claimed to survive lightning strikes more often than transistor transmitters do for rf power levels above 20 kilowatts vacuum tubes are commonly more efficient and reliable than similar solid state circuits cathodes in small receiving tubes are coated with a mixture of barium oxide and strontium oxide sometimes with addition of calcium oxide or aluminium oxide an electric heater is inserted into the cathode sleeve and insulated from it electrically by a coating of aluminium oxide this complex construction causes barium and strontium atoms to diffuse to the surface of the cathode when heated to about 780 degrees celsius thus emitting electrons the colossus computer s designer dr tommy flowers had a theory that most of the unreliability was caused during power down and power up once colossus was built and installed it was switched on and left switched on running from dual redundant diesel generators the only time it was switched off was for conversion to the colossus mk2 and the addition of another 500 or so tubes another 9 colossus mk2s were built and all 10 machines ran with a surprising degree of reliability the 10 colossi consumed 15 kilowatts of power each 24 hours a day 365 days a year nearly all of it for the tube heaters to meet the reliability requirements of the early digital computer whirlwind it was necessary to build special computer vacuum tubes with extended cathode life the problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of silicon used in the tungsten alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw elimination of the silicon from the heater wire alloy allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the whirlwind project the tubes developed for whirlwind later found their way into the giant sage air defense computer system high purity nickel tubing and cathode coatings free of materials that can poison emission also contribute to long cathode life the first such computer tube was sylvania s 7ak7 of 1948 by the late 1950s it was routine for special quality small signal tubes to last for hundreds of thousands of hours if operated conservatively this reliability made mid cable amplifiers in submarine cables possible near the end of world war ii to make radios more rugged some aircraft and army radios began to integrate the tube envelopes into the radio s cast aluminium or zinc chassis the radio became just a printed circuit with non tube components soldered to the chassis that contained all the tubes during wwii in 1942 rugged metal vacuum tubes were mounted in anti aircraft shells these proximity fuzes made anti aircraft shells 6 times more effective in the fall of 1944 artillery shells with proximity fuzes were used tiny tubes were later known as subminiature types they were widely used in 1950s military and aviation electronics tubes were heavily used in the early generations of electronic devices such as radios televisions and early computers such as the colossus which used 2000 tubes the eniac which used nearly 18 000 tubes and the ibm 700 series vacuum tubes are less susceptible than corresponding solid state components to the electromagnetic pulse effect of nuclear explosions this property kept them in use for certain military applications long after transistors had replaced them elsewhere vacuum tubes are still used for very high powered applications such as microwave ovens industrial radio frequency heating generating large amounts of rf energy for particle accelerators and power amplification for broadcasting many audiophiles professional audio engineers and musicians prefer the tube sound of audio equipment based on vacuum tubes over electronics based on transistors there are companies which still make specialized audio hardware featuring tube technology the sound produced by a tube based amplifier with the tubes overloaded is widely used in electric guitar amplification and has defined the texture of some genres of music such as classic rock and blues guitarists often prefer tube amplifiers for the warmth of their tone and the natural compression effect they can apply to an input signal in 2002 computer motherboard maker aopen brought back the vacuum tube for modern computer use by releasing the ax4ge tube g motherboard this motherboard uses a sovtek 6922 vacuum tube as part of aopen s tubesound technology aopen claims that the vacuum tube brings superior sound like any electronic device vacuum tubes produce heat while operating this waste heat is one of the principal factors that affect tube life the majority of this waste heat originates in the anode though some grids may also require cooling to remove excess heat for example the cooling of the screen grid in an el34 is facilitated by the addition of two small radiators or wings located near the top of the tube the heater also contributes to the total waste heat a tube s data sheet will normally identify the maximum amount of heat each element may dissipate the method of anode cooling is dependent on the construction of the tube itself for tubes with internal anodes such as the 12ax7 or el34 the cooling occurs by radiating the heat by black body radiation from the anode to the glass envelope natural air circulation convection then removes the heat from the envelop tube shields that aided heat dispersal could be retrofitted on certain select types of tubes these shields act by improving heat conduction from the surface of the tube to the shield itself by means of tens of copper tongues in contact with the glass tube and have an opaque black outside finish for improved heat radiation the ability to remove heat may be further increased by implementing forced air cooling adding fins to the anode and operating the anode at elevated red hot temperatures all of these measures are implemented in the 4 1000a transmitting tube the amount of heat that may be removed from a tube with an internal anode is limited tubes with external anodes may be cooled using forced air water vapor and multiphase the 3cx10 000a7 is an example of a tube with an external anode cooled by forced air the water vapor and multiphase cooling techniques all depend on the high specific heat and latent heat of water the 8974 is an example of a water cooled tube and in among the largest commercial tube available today in a water cooled tubes the anode voltage appears directly on the cooling water surface thus requiring the water to be an electrical insulator otherwise the high voltage can be conducted through the cooling water to the radiator system hence the need for deionized water such systems usually have a built in water conductance monitor which will shut down the high tension supply if the conductance becomes too high many devices were built during the 1920 1960 period using vacuum tube techniques most such tubes were rendered obsolete by semiconductors some techniques for integrating multiple devices in a single module sharing the same glass envelope have been discussed above such as the loewe 3nf vacuum tube electronic devices still in common use include the magnetron klystron photomultiplier x ray tube traveling wave tube and cathode ray tube the magnetron is the type of tube used in all microwave ovens in spite of the advancing state of the art in power semiconductor technology the vacuum tube still has reliability and cost advantages for high frequency rf power generation photomultipliers are still the most sensitive detectors of light many televisions oscilloscopes and computer monitors still use cathode ray tubes though flat panel displays are becoming more popular as prices drop many of the better tube radios had so called tuning eye indicator tubes behind their front panels with just the top of the tube showing secondary emission is the term for what happens when electrons in a vacuum strike certain materials and the impacts cause electrons to be emitted for some materials more electrons are emitted than originally hit the surface such devices called electron multipliers amplify the current represented by the incoming electrons several stages can be cascaded for high gain and are essential parts of very sensitive phototubes usually called photomultipliers or multiplier photoubes the image orthicon tv studio camera tubes also used multistage photomultipliers for decades electron tube designers tried to use secondary emission to obtain more amplification in vacuum tubes with hot cathodes but they suffered from short life because the material used for the secondary emission electrode poisoned the tube s hot cathode however eventually philips of the netherlands developed the efp60 tube that had a satisfactory lifetime and was used in at least one product a laboratory pulse generator however transistors were rapidly improving and eclipsed tubes in general a variant called a channel electron multiplier is a curved tube such as a helix coated on the inside with material with good secondary emission one type had a little funnel to capture incoming electrons the tube was resistive and its ends were connected to enough voltage to create repeated cascades of electrons tektronix made a high performance wideband oscilloscope crt with a channel electron multiplier plate behind the phosphor layer this plate was a bundled array of a huge number of short individual c e m tubes that accepted a low current beam and intensified it to provide a display of practical brightness the fluorescent displays commonly used on videocassette recorders and automotive dashboards are vacuum tubes using phosphor coated anodes to form the display characters and a heated filamentary cathode as an electron source called vfds or vacuum fluorescent displays because the filaments are in view they must be operated at temperatures where the filament does not glow visibly these devices are often found in automotive applications where their high brightness allows reading the display in daylight some tubes like magnetrons traveling wave tubes carcinotrons and klystrons combine magnetic and electrostatic effects these are efficient rf producers and still find use in radar microwave ovens and industrial heating traveling wave tubes are very good amplifiers they are used in some communications satellites high powered klystron amplifier tubes can provide hundreds of kilowatts in the uhf range gyrotrons or vacuum masers used to generate high power millimetre band waves are magnetic vacuum tubes in which a small relativistic effect due to the high voltage is used for bunching the electrons gyrotrons can generate very high powers free electron lasers used to generate high power coherent light and perhaps even x rays are highly relativistic vacuum tubes driven by high energy particle accelerators particle accelerators can be considered vacuum tubes that work backward the electric fields driving the electrons or other charged particles in this respect a cathode ray tube is a particle accelerator a tube in which electrons move through a vacuum within a gas tight envelope is generically called an electron tube some condenser microphone designs use built in vacuum tube preamplifiers as of 2008 scores of small companies are manufacturing audiophile amplifiers and preamps that use vacuum tubes in the early years of the 21st century there has been renewed interest in vacuum tubes this time with the electron emitter formed on a flat silicon substrate as in integrated circuit technology this subject is now called vacuum nanoelectronics the most common design uses a cold cathode in the form of a large area field electron source with these devices electrons are field emitted from a large number of closely spaced individual emission sites their claimed advantages include greatly enhanced robustness combined with the ability to provide high power outputs at low power consumptions operating on the same principles as traditional tubes prototype device cathodes have been fabricated in several different ways although a common approach is to use a field emitter array one interesting idea is to etch electrodes to form hinged flaps similar to the technology used to create the microscopic mirrors used in digital light processing that are stood upright by an electrostatic charge such integrated microtubes may find application in microwave devices including mobile phones for bluetooth and wi fi transmission in radar and for satellite communication presently they are being studied for possible applications in field emission display technology but significant production problems seem to exist vacuum tubes are still being manufactured in the following countries products marketed by full music and sophia electric brands some models marketed by taylor tubes brand known formerly as tube factory of jsc reflektor manufacturer of winged c 300b and el509 tubes formerly philips transmitting tube factory 
serge gainsbourg was a french singer songwriter actor and director gainsbourg s varied musical style and individuality made him difficult to categorize his legacy has been firmly established and he is often regarded as one of the world s most influential musicians he was born lucien ginsburg in paris france the son of russian jewish parents joseph ginsburg and olga bessman who fled to france after the 1917 bolshevik uprising his childhood was profoundly affected by the occupation of france by nazi germany during which he and his family as jews were forced to wear the yellow star and eventually flee paris before he was 30 years old gainsbourg was a disillusioned painter but earned his living as a piano player in bars he first married on 3 november 1951 with elisabeth lize levitsky whom he divorced in 1957 he married a second time on 7 january 1964 with françoise antoinette béatrice pancrazzi whom he divorced in february 1966 and with whom he had two children a daughter named natacha and a son paul by mid 1968 he fell in love with english singer and actress jane birkin whom he met during the shooting of slogan they gave birth to actress charlotte on 5 january 1986 his youngest son lucien was born to his last partner bambou birkin recollects the beginning of her affair with gainsbourg where he first took her to a nightclub then to a transvestite club and afterwards to the hilton where he passed out in a drunken stupor gainsbourg married birkin when she was 21 and he was 40 birkin left gainsbourg when pregnant with her third daughter lou by the film director jacques doillon whom she later married his early songs were influenced by boris vian and were largely in the vein of old fashioned chanson very early however gainsbourg began to move beyond this and experiment with a succession of different musical styles jazz early on pop in the 1960s reggae in the 1970s and electronica in the 1980s many of his songs contained themes with a morbid or sexual twist in them an early success le poinçonneur des lilas describes the day in the life of a paris métro ticket man whose job it is to stamp holes in passengers tickets gainsbourg describes this chore as so monotonous that the man eventually thinks of putting a hole into his own head and being buried in another more success began to arrive when in 1965 his song poupée de cire poupée de son was the luxembourg entry in the eurovision song contest performed by french teen singer france gall it won first prize his next song for gall les sucettes caused a scandal in france gainsbourg had written the song with double meanings and strong sexual innuendo of which the singer was apparently unaware when she recorded it whereas gall thought that the song was about a girl enjoying lollipops it was really about oral sex the controversy arising from the song although a big hit for gall threw her career off track in france for several years gainsbourg arranged other gall songs and lps that were characteristic of the late 1960s psychedelic styles among them gall s 1968 album another of serge s songs boum bada boum was entered in by monaco in the 1967 contest sung by minouche barelli it came fifth he also wrote hit songs for other artists such as comment te dire adieu for françoise hardy in 1969 he released je t aime moi non plus which featured simulated sounds of female orgasm the song appeared that year on an lp jane birkin serge gainsbourg originally recorded with brigitte bardot it was released with future girlfriend birkin when bardot backed out while gainsbourg declared it the ultimate love song it was considered too hot the song was censored in various countries and in france even the toned down version was suppressed the vatican made a public statement citing the song as offensive it reached no 1 in the uk singles chart histoire de melody nelson was released in 1971 this concept album produced and arranged by jean claude vannier tells the story of a lolita esque affair with gainsbourg as the narrator and jane birkin as the eponymous english heroine it features prominent string arrangements and even a massed choir at its tragic climax the album has proven influential with artists such as air david holmes jarvis cocker beck and dan the automator in 1975 he released the album rock around the bunker a rock album written entirely on the subject of the nazis gainsbourg used black humour as he and his family suffered during world war ii while a child in paris gainsbourg had worn the yellow badge as the mark of a jew rock around the bunker belonged in the mid 1970s retro trend the next year saw the release of another major work l homme à tête de chou featuring the new character marilou and sumptuous orchestral themes cabbage head man is one of his nicknames as it refers to his ears musically l homme à tête de chou turned out to be gainsbourg s last lp in the english rock style he had favoured since the late 1960s he would go on to produce two reggae albums recorded in jamaica and two electronic funk albums recorded in new york in jamaica in 1978 he recorded aux armes et cetera a reggae version of the french national anthem la marseillaise with robbie shakespeare sly dunbar and rita marley this song earned him death threats from right wing veterans of the algerian war of independence who were opposed to certain lyrics bob marley was furious when he discovered gainsbourg made his wife rita marley sing erotic lyrics shortly afterward gainsbourg bought the original manuscript of la marseillaise he was able to reply to his critics that his version was in fact closer to the original as the manuscript clearly shows the words aux armes et cætera  for the chorus the next year saw him coin the nickname gainsbarre for himself in the song ecce homo after a 13 year long turbulent relationship jane birkin left gainsbourg in the 1980s approaching the end of his life gainsbourg became a regular figure on french tv his appearances seemed devoted to his controversial sense of humour and provocation in march 1984 while this was illegal and highly offending he burned a 500 french franc note on television to protest against heavy taxation he would show up drunk and unshaven on stage in april 1986 in michel drucker s live saturday evening show with the american singer whitney houston he exclaimed to the host i want to fuck her the same year in another talk show interview he appeared alongside catherine ringer a well known singer who in the past had appeared in pornographic films gainsbourg shouted you re nothing but a filthy whore a filthy fucking whore ringer scolded back look at you you re just a bitter old alcoholic i used to admire you but these days you ve become a disgusting old parasite by december 1988 while a judge at a film festival in val d isère he appeared drunk and in a rage at a local theatre where he was to do a presentation while on stage he began to tell an obscene story about brigitte bardot and a champagne bottle only to stagger offstage and collapse in a nearby seat subsequent years saw his health deteriorate he had to undergo liver surgery although he denied any connection to cancer or cirrhosis his appearances and releases become sparser as he had to rest and recover in vezelay during these final years he released love on the beat a controversial electronic album with mostly sexual themes in the lyrics and his last studio album you re under arrest which was a collaboration with larry fast presented more synth driven songs his songs became increasingly eccentric during this period ranging from the anti drug aux enfants de la chance to the duet with his daughter charlotte named lemon incest this translates as inceste de citron a wordplay on un zeste de citron the title demonstrates gainsbourg s love for puns during his career he wrote the soundtracks for more than 40 films in 1996 he received a césar award for best music written for a film for élisa along with zbigniew preisner and michel colombier he directed four movies je t aime moi non plus équateur charlotte for ever and stan the flasher he made an brief appearance with jane birkin in 1980 in egon schiele exzess und bestrafung a film by herbert vesely gainsbourg died on 2 march 1991 of a heart attack he was buried in montparnasse cemetery in paris his funeral brought paris to a standstill and french president françois mitterrand said of him he was our baudelaire our apollinaire he elevated the song to the level of art his home at the well known address 5bis rue de verneuil is still covered in graffiti and poems since his death gainsbourg s music has reached legendary stature in france his lyrical brilliance in french has left an extraordinary legacy his music always progressive covered many styles jazz ballads mambo lounge reggae pop disco calypso africana bossa nova and rock and roll he has gained a following in the english speaking world with many non mainstream artists finding his arrangements highly influential he is also considered to be one of the first music pop artists of the late 1960s while artists such as andy warhol and roy lichtenstein explored modern iconographic consumer culture through painting gainsbourg explored similar territory in music with songs such as comic strip ford mustang qui est in qui est out and teenie weenie boppie one of the most frequent interpreters of gainsbourg s songs was british singer petula clark whose success in france was propelled by her recordings of his tunes in 2003 she wrote and recorded la chanson de gainsbourg as a tribute to the composer of some of her biggest hits his lyrics are collected in the volume dernières nouvelles des étoiles in 2005 the album monsieur gainsbourg revisited was released by virgin records the album consisted of specially recorded english language cover versions of gainsbourg s songs recorded by artists as diverse as franz ferdinand portishead placebo and michael stipe géo voumard  guus jansen  andré claveau  dick

woodrow wilson woody guthrie is best known as an american singer songwriter and folk musician whose musical legacy includes hundreds of political traditional and children s songs ballads and improvised works he frequently performed with the slogan this machine kills fascists displayed on his guitar his best known song is probably this land is your land which is regularly sung in american schools many of his recorded songs are archived in the library of congress guthrie traveled with migrant workers from oklahoma to california and learned traditional folk and blues songs many of his songs are about his experiences in the dust bowl era during the great depression earning him the nickname the dust bowl troubadour throughout his life guthrie was associated with united states communist groups though he was never an actual member of any guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children including american folk musician arlo guthrie he is the grandfather of musician sarah lee guthrie guthrie died from complications of huntington s disease a progressive genetic neurological disorder during his later years in spite of his illness guthrie served as a figurehead in the folk movement providing inspiration to a generation of new folk musicians including mentor relationships with ramblin jack elliott and less directly bob dylan in 1997 woody guthrie was inducted into the oklahoma music hall of fame guthrie was born in okemah a small town in okfuskee county oklahoma to nora belle sherman and charles edward guthrie his parents named him after woodrow wilson then governor of new jersey the democratic candidate soon to be elected president of the united states charley guthrie was an industrious businessman owning at one time up to 30 plots of land in okfuskee county he was also actively involved in oklahoma politics and was a democratic candidate for office in the county the young guthrie would often accompany his father when charley made stump speeches in the area guthrie s early family life was affected by several tragic fires including one which caused the loss of his family s home in okemah his sister clara later died in a coal oil fire when guthrie was seven and guthrie s father was thereafter severely burned also in a coal oil fire the circumstances of these fires especially the one in which charley was injured remain unclear it is not known whether they were simple accidents or the result of actions by guthrie s mother who unknown to the guthries at the time was suffering from the progressive neurodegenerative disorder huntington s disease nora guthrie was eventually committed to the oklahoma hospital for the insane where she died in 1930 from huntington s disease it is also suspected that her father george sherman judging from the circumstances surrounding his death by drowning suffered from the same hereditary disease with nora guthrie institutionalized and charley guthrie living in pampa texas working to repay his debts from unsuccessful real estate deals woody guthrie and his siblings were on their own in oklahoma and relied on their eldest brother roy guthrie for support the 14 year old guthrie worked odd jobs around okemah bumming meals and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends according to one story guthrie made friends with an african american blues harmonica player named george whom he would watch play at the man s shoe shine booth before long guthrie bought his own harmonica and began playing along but in another interview 14 years later guthrie claimed that he learned how to play harmonica from a boyhood friend john woods and that his earlier story was false he seemed to have a natural affinity for music and easily learned to play by ear he began to use his musical skills around town playing a song for a sandwich or coins guthrie easily learned old irish ballads and traditional songs from the parents of friends although he did not excel as a student his teachers described him as bright he was also an avid reader and read books on a wide range of topics friends remember him reading constantly eventually guthrie s father sent for his son to come to texas where little would change for the now aspiring musician guthrie now 18 was reluctant to attend high school classes in pampa and spent a lot of time learning songs by busking on the streets and reading at the library he was growing as a musician gaining practice by regularly playing at dances for his father s half brother jeff guthrie a fiddle player in addition he spent much time at the library in pampa s city hall and wrote a manuscript summarizing everything he had read on the basics of psychology a librarian in pampa shelved this manuscript under guthrie s name but it was later lost in a library reorganization at age 19 guthrie met and married his first wife mary jennings with whom he had three children with the advent of the dust bowl era guthrie left texas leaving mary behind and joined the thousands of okies who were migrating to california looking for work many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by these working class people in the late 1930s guthrie achieved fame in los angeles california with radio partner maxine lefty lou crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial hillbilly music and traditional folk music guthrie was making enough money to send for his family still living in texas while appearing on radio station kfvd a commercial radio station owned by a populist minded new deal democrat frank burke guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that would eventually appear on dust bowl ballads it was at kfvd that guthrie met newscaster ed robbin robbin was impressed with a song guthrie wrote about thomas mooney a wrongly convicted man who was at the time a leftist cause célèbre robbin who became guthrie s political mentor introduced guthrie to socialists and communists in southern california including will geer who would remain guthrie s lifelong friend and helped guthrie book benefit performances in the communist circles in southern california notwithstanding guthrie s later claim that the best thing that i did in 1936 was to sign up with the communist party he was never actually a member of the party he was however noted as a fellow traveler or an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party without being subject to party discipline despite not being a party member guthrie requested to write a column for the communist newspaper the daily worker the column titled woody sez appeared a total of 174 times from may 1939 to january 1940 woody sez was not explicitly political but rather was about current events that guthrie observed and experienced the column was written in an exaggerated hillbilly dialect and usually included a small comic the columns were later published as a collection after guthrie s death steve earle said of woody i don t think of woody guthrie as a political writer he was a writer who lived in very political times with the outbreak of world war ii and the nonaggression pact the soviet union had signed with germany in 1939 kfvd radio owners did not want its staff spinning apologia for the soviet union both robbin and guthrie left the station without the daily radio show prospects for employment diminished and guthrie and his family returned to pampa texas although mary guthrie was happy to return to texas the wanderlusting guthrie soon after accepted will geer s invitation to come to new york city and headed east arriving in new york guthrie known as the oklahoma cowboy was embraced by its leftist folk music community and slept on a couch in will geer s apartment guthrie also made what were his first real recordings several hours of conversation and songs that were recorded by folklorist alan lomax for the library of congress as well as an album dust bowl ballads for victor records in camden new jersey guthrie was tired of the radio overplaying irving berlin s god bless america he thought the song was unrealistic and complacent partly inspired by his experiences during a cross country trip and his distaste for god bless america he penned his most famous song this land is your land in february 1940 it was titled god blessed america the melody is based on the gospel song oh my loving brother best known as little darling pal of mine sung by the country group the carter family guthrie signed the manuscript with the comment all you can write is what you see woody g n y n y n y he protested class inequality in the final verses these verses were often omitted in subsequent recordings sometimes by guthrie though the song was written in 1940 it would be four years before he recorded it for moses asch in april 1944 and even longer until sheet music was produced and given to schools by howie richmond in march 1940 guthrie was invited to play at a benefit hosted by the steinbeck committee to aid farm workers to raise money for migrant workers john steinbeck s book the grapes of wrath was quite popular it was at this concert guthrie met pete seeger and the two men became good friends later seeger accompanied guthrie back to texas to meet other members of the guthrie family and has recalled an awkward conversation with mary guthrie s mother in which she asked seeger s help in persuading guthrie to treat her daughter better guthrie had some success in new york at this time as a guest on cbs s radio program back where i come from and used his influence to get a spot on the show for his friend huddie lead belly ledbetter ledbetter s tenth street apartment was a gathering spot for the left wing musician circle in new york at the time and guthrie and ledbetter were good friends after having busked together at bars in harlem in september 1940 guthrie was invited by the model tobacco company to host their radio program pipe smoking time guthrie was paid 180 a week an impressive salary in 1940 he was finally making enough money to send regular payments back to mary and eventually brought mary and the children to new york where the family lived in an apartment on central park west the reunion represented woody s desire to be a better father and husband he said i have to set real hard to think of being a dad unfortunately for the newly relocated family guthrie quit after the seventh broadcast claiming he had begun to feel the show was too restricting when he was told what to sing disgruntled with new york guthrie packed up mary and his children in a new car and headed west to california in may 1941 after a brief stay in los angeles guthrie moved the family to washington in the pacific northwest on the promise of a job a documentary directed by gunther von fritsch was being created in support of the bonneville power administration s building of the grand coulee dam on the columbia river and needed a narrator supported by a recommendation from alan lomax the original idea was to have guthrie narrate the film and sing songs onscreen the original project was projected to take one year to complete but when filmmakers became worried about the implications of casting such a political figure guthrie s role was minimized he was hired instead for one month only by the department of the interior to write songs about the columbia river and the building of the federal dams for the documentary s soundtrack while there guthrie toured the columbia river and the pacific northwest guthrie said he couldn t believe it it s a paradise and was creatively inspired in one month guthrie wrote 26 songs including three of his most famous roll on columbia pastures of plenty and grand coulee dam the surviving songs were eventually released as columbia river songs the film was not completed and was only released in a limited form at the conclusion of the month in oregon and washington guthrie wanted to return to new york tired of the continual uprooting mary guthrie told him to go without her and the children although guthrie would see mary again once on a tour through los angeles with the almanac singers it was essentially the end of their marriage divorce was difficult with mary being a member of the catholic church but she reluctantly agreed in december 1943 following the conclusion of his work in washington state guthrie corresponded with pete seeger about seeger s newly formed folk protest group the almanac singers guthrie returned to new york with plans to tour the country as a member of the group the singers originally worked out of a loft in new york city hosting regular concerts called hootenannys a word pete and woody had picked up in their cross country travels the singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative almanac house in greenwich village initially guthrie helped write and sing what the almanacs singers termed peace songs while the nazi soviet pact was in effect until hitler invaded the soviet union in june 1941 the communist line was that world war ii was a capitalist fraud after hitler s invasion of the soviet union the topics of their songs became anti fascist the members of the almanac singers and residents of the almanac house were a loosely defined group of musicians though the core members included guthrie pete seeger millard lampell and lee hays in keeping with common socialist ideals meals chores and rent at the almanac house were shared the sunday hootenannys were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent songs written in the almanac house had shared songwriting credits among all the members although in the case of union maid members would later state that guthrie wrote the song ensuring that his children would receive residuals in the almanac house guthrie added an air of authenticity to their work since guthrie was a real working class oklahoman there was the heart of america personified in woody and for a new york left that was primarily jewish first or second generation american and was desperately trying to get americanized i think a figure like woody was of great great importance a friend of the group irwin silber would say woody would routinely emphasize his working class image reject songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with and would rarely contribute to household chores house member agnes sis cunningham another okie would later recall that woody loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for pete seeger s post almanac singers project people s songs a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers founded in 1945 guthrie was a prolific writer penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose many written while living in new york city after a recording session with alan lomax lomax suggested guthrie write an autobiography in lomax s opinion guthrie s descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts of american childhood that he had read it was during this time that guthrie met a dancer in new york who would become his second wife marjorie mazia mazia was an instructor at the prestigious martha graham dance school where she was assisting sophie maslow with her piece folksay based on the folklore and poetry collected by carl sandburg it included the adaptation of some of guthrie s dust bowl ballads for the dance studio he continued writing songs and as lomax had suggested began work on his autobiography the end product bound for glory was completed in no small part due to the patient editing assistance of mazia and was first published by e p dutton in 1943 it is a vivid tale told in the artist s own down home dialect with the flair and imagery of a true storyteller library journal complained about the too careful reproduction of illiterate speech but clifton fadiman reviewing the book in the new york times paid the author a fine tribute some day people are going to wake up to the fact that woody guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession like yellowstone and yosemite and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world a film adaptation of bound for glory was released in 1976 in 1944 guthrie met moses moe asch of folkways records for whom he first recorded this land is your land and over the next few years recorded worried man blues along with hundreds of other songs these recordings would later be released by folkways and stinson records who had joint distribution rights to the recordings the folkways recordings are still available today with the most complete series of these sessions culled from dates with asch simply titled the asch recordings guthrie believed performing his anti fascist songs and poems at home were the best use of his talents guthrie lobbied the united states army to accept him as a uso performer instead of conscripting him as a soldier in the draft when guthrie s attempts failed his friends cisco houston and jim longhi pressured guthrie to join the u s merchant marine guthrie followed their advice he served as a mess man and dish washer and frequently sang for the crew and troops to buoy the spirits on transatlantic voyages guthrie made attempts to write about his experience in the merchant marine but was never satisfied with the results longhi later wrote about these experiences in his book woody cisco and me the book offers a rare first hand account of guthrie during his merchant marine service in 1945 guthrie s association with communism made him ineligible for further service in the merchant marine and he was drafted into the u s army while he was on furlough from the army guthrie and marjorie were married after his discharge they moved into a house on mermaid avenue in coney island and over time had four children one of their children cathy died as a result of

guthrie wrote and recorded songs to grow on for mother and child a collection of children s music which includes the song goodnight little arlo written when arlo was about nine years old a 1948 crash of a plane carrying 28 mexican farm workers from oakland california on their way to be deported back to mexico inspired woody to write deportee the years living on mermaid avenue were among guthrie s most productive periods as a writer his extensive writings from this time were archived and maintained by marjorie and later his estate mostly handled by guthrie s daughter nora several of the manuscripts contain scribblings by a young arlo and the other guthrie offspring during this time ramblin jack elliott studied extensively under guthrie visiting his home and observing how he wrote and performed elliott like bob dylan later idolized guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire due to guthrie s illness dylan and guthrie s son arlo would later claim that they learned much of guthrie s performance style from elliott when asked about arlo s claim elliott said i was flattered dylan learned from me the same way i learned from woody woody didn t teach me he just said if you want to learn something just steal it that s the way i learned from lead belly by the late 1940s guthrie s health was declining and his behavior becoming extremely erratic he received various diagnoses but in 1952 was finally diagnosed with huntington s disease the genetic disorder inherited from his mother believing him to be a danger to their children marjorie suggested he return to california without her and they eventually divorced upon his return to california guthrie lived in a compound owned by will geer with blacklisted singers and actors waiting out the political climate as his health worsened he met and married his third wife anneke van kirk and they had a child lorina lynn the couple moved to florida briefly living in a bus on land owned by a friend guthrie s arm was hurt in a campfire accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded although in time he regained movement in the arm he was never able to play the guitar again in

divorce guthrie s second wife marjorie reentered his life marjorie cared for him and assisted him until his death guthrie increasingly unable to control his muscle movements was hospitalized at greystone park psychiatric hospital from 1956 to 1961 at brooklyn state hospital until 1966 and finally at creedmoor psychiatric center until his death marjorie and the children visited guthrie at greystone every sunday they answered fan mail and played on the hospital grounds eventually a longtime fan of guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for these sunday visits lasting until guthrie was moved to the brooklyn state hospital which was closer to where marjorie lived guthrie s illness was essentially untreated due to a lack of information about the disease at the time however his death helped raise awareness of the disease and led marjorie to help found the committee to combat huntington s disease which became the huntington s disease society of america none of guthrie s three remaining children with marjorie have developed symptoms of huntington s but two of mary guthrie s children were diagnosed with the disease both died at 41 years of age in the late 1950s and early 1960s a new generation of young people were inspired by folk singers including guthrie these folk revivalists became more politically aware in their music the american folk revival was beginning to take place focused on the issues of the day such as the civil rights movement and free speech movement pockets of folk singers were forming around the country in places like cambridge massachusetts and the greenwich village neighborhood of new york city one of guthrie s visitors at greystone park was 19 year old bob dylan who idolized guthrie dylan wrote of guthrie s repertoire the songs themselves were really beyond category they had the infinite sweep of humanity in them after learning of guthrie s whereabouts young folk singers regularly visited him during the final years of his life playing his own songs for him as well as their originals guthrie died of complications of huntington s disease in 1967 by the time of his death his work had been discovered by a new audience introduced to them in part through bob dylan pete seeger ramblin jack elliott his ex wife marjorie and other new members of the folk revival and his son arlo because you are too old or too young or too fat or too slim too ugly or too this or too that songs that run you down or poke fun at you on account of your bad luck or hard traveling i am out to fight those songs to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood i am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world and that if it has hit you pretty hard and knocked you for a dozen loops no matter what color what size you are how you are built the woody guthrie foundation is a non profit organization that serves as administrator and caretaker of the woody guthrie archives the archive houses the largest

inaugural year of the festival marjorie mazia was born marjorie greenblatt and her mother aliza greenblatt was a well known yiddish poet with her guthrie wrote numerous jewish lyrics guthrie s jewish lyrics can be traced to the unusual collaborative relationship he had with his mother in law who lived across from guthrie and his family in brooklyn in the 1940s guthrie the oklahoma troubadour and greenblatt the jewish wordsmith often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other s works finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice despite very different backgrounds their collaboration flourished in 1940s brooklyn where jewish culture was interwoven with music modern dance poetry and anti fascist pro labor classical socialist activism guthrie was inspired to write songs that came directly out of this unlikely relationship both personal and political he identified the problems of jews with those of his fellow okies and other oppressed peoples

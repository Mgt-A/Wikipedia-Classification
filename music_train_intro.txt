binaural beats or binaural tones are auditory processing artifacts or apparent sounds the perception of which arises in the brain independent of physical stimuli this effect was discovered in 1839 by heinrich wilhelm dove the brain produces a phenomenon resulting in low frequency pulsations in the loudness of a perceived sound when two tones at slightly different frequencies are presented separately one to each of a subject s ears using stereo headphones a beating tone will be perceived as if the two tones mixed naturally out of the brain the frequency of the tones must be below about 1 000 to 1 500 hertz for the beating to be heard the difference between the two frequencies must be small for the effect to occur otherwise the two tones will be heard separately and no beat will be perceived binaural beats are of interest to neurophysiologists investigating the sense of hearing second binaural beats reportedly influence the brain in more subtle ways through the entrainment of brainwaves and can be used to produce relaxation and other health benefits such as pain relief

schenkerian analysis is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of heinrich schenker the goal of a schenkerian analysis is to reveal the underlying structure of a tonal work in fact its basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining tonality in music the primary means of describing the structure of a musical passage for the schenkerian analyst is to show hierarchical relationships among the pitches of the passage this can be done through making reductions of the music and through a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that schenker devised to demonstrate various prolongational techniques the musical reductions of schenkerian analysis are usually arrhythmic this reflects schenker s belief that the deep long range structure of a piece of music has no particular rhythm this long range structure is called the fundamental structure in schenkerian analysis while the more surface aspects of the music are called the foreground or surface layer so one could rephrase the previous statement as the background of a musical composition is arhythmic or better yet rhythm is a characteristic of the musical foreground open and closed noteheads beams and flags which show rhythm in ordinary musical notation are used in schenkerian analysis to show hierarchical relationships between the pitch events being analyzed schenkerian analysis is a subjective not an objective method this means that there is no mechanical procedure for arriving at an analysis for a given piece of music rather the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst therefore this form of analysis is more art criticism than science the analysis represents a way of hearing a piece of music schenker himself was certain that a tonal masterpiece contains an inner truth content although few are sufficiently gifted to appreciate it although it is a subject of debate among music theorists whether there is a single correct hearing and analysis of a piece of tonal music even those who hold that there is a unique correct analysis agree that the analysis can only be arrived at and evaluated subjectively by an expert listener therefore learning how to do schenkerian analysis is above all else learning a way of hearing and understanding tonal music and it requires study and practice just as learning to play an instrument does

algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music algorithms have been used to compose music for centuries the procedures used to plot voice leading in western counterpoint for example can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy the term is usually reserved however for the use of formal procedures to make music without human intervention either through the introduction of chance procedures or the use of computers there is a radical distinction between composers who use indeterminate procedures to compose music and those who use routines which produce deterministic results given a fixed input into the algorithm many algorithms that have no immediate musical relevance are used by composers as creative inspiration for their music algorithms such as fractals l systems statistical models and even arbitrary data are fair game for musical interpretation the success or failure of these procedures as sources of good music largely depends on the mapping system employed by the composer to translate the non musical information into a musical data stream

the muses perhaps from the proto indo european root men think in greek mythology poetry and literature are the goddesses or spirits who inspire the creation of literature and the arts they were considered the source of the knowledge related orally for centuries in the ancient culture that was contained in poetic lyrics and myths originally said to be three in number by the classical times of the 400s bc their number had grown and become set at nine goddesses who embody the arts and inspire the creation process with their graces through remembered and improvised song and stage writing traditional music and dance in one myth king pieride once king of mazedonia had nine daughters he named after the nine muses believing that their skills were a great match to the muses he thus challenged the muses to a match resulting in his daughters being turned into magpies and jackdaws in greek mythology these nine daughters of the king usually are referred to as the pierides sometimes they are referred to as water nymphs associated with the springs of helicon and with pieris the olympian myths set apollo as their leader apollon mousagetēs not only are the muses explicitly used in modern english to refer to an inspiration as when one cites one s own artistic muse but they also are implicit in words and phrases such as amuse museum music and musing upon according to hesiod s theogony they were daughters of zeus the second generation king of the gods and the offspring of mnemosyne goddess of memory for alcman and mimnermus they were even more primordial springing from the early deities uranus and gaia gaia is mother earth an early mother goddess who was worshipped at delphi from prehistoric times long before the site was rededicated to apollo possibly indicating a transfer to association with him after that time pausanias records a tradition of two generations of muses the first being daughters of uranus and gaia the second of zeus and mnemosyne another rarer genealogy is that they are daughters of harmonia which contradicts the myth in which they were dancing at the wedding of harmonia and cadmus this later inconsistency is an example of how clues to the true dating or chronology of myths may be determined by the appearance of figures and concepts in greek myths compare the roman inspiring nymphs of springs the camenae the völva of norse mythology and also the apsaras in the mythology of classical india

in music a power chord play is a note plus the note a fifth above usually played on electric guitar theorists are divided on whether the term chord is appropriate with some requiring the third of the chord for it to be considered an actual chord therefore some would consider it to be a dyad or simply interval however this usage is accepted among guitar players in other words it s a chord with no 3rd a power chord is neither major or minor because the intervals between the notes are perfect fifths and when inverted perfect fourths in order for a chord to be considered major or minor the notes in the chord itself must be related by a major or minor interval however power chords can sound major or minor to our ears because our brain fills in those missing thirds where it expects them when the power chord s root is based on a note diatonic in the scale of the song our ear expects a chord with same root in addition such chords are usually played with octave doubling which makes a different sound than just a 5th power chords are used where a distorted overdriven tone is used because including the third tends to result in unpleasant harmonics and an indistinct root note when combined with the additional overtones added by an amplifier or distortion pedal they have the added advantage of being relatively easy to play although the use of the term power chord has to some extent spilled over into the vocabulary of other instrumentalists namely keyboard and synthesizer players it remains essentially a part of rock guitar culture and is most strongly associated with the overdriven electric guitar styles of hard rock heavy metal punk rock and similar genres when the same interval is found in traditional and classical music the harmonic interpretation will be much more varied not necessarily implying a triad with the third degree omitted power chords are sometimes notated 5 as in c5 in which case it specifically refers to playing the root and fifth of the chord in this case c and g possibly inverted and possibly with octave doublings it can also sound different if you keep adding octaves of the fifth and octaves of the bass note as it will sound higher pitched with less power but still a power chord this an example of multiple octave doublings 
granular synthesis is a basic sound synthesis method that operates on the microsound time scale it is often based on the same principles as sampling but often includes analog technology the samples are not used directly however they are split in small pieces of around 1 to 50 ms in length or the synthesized sounds are very short these small pieces are called grains multiple grains may be layered on top of each other all playing at different speed phase and volume the result is no single tone but a soundscape often a cloud that is subject to manipulation in a way unlike any natural sound and also unlike the sounds produced by most other synthesis techniques by varying the waveform envelope duration spatial position and density of the grains many different sounds can be produced the result is usable as music sound effects or as raw material for further processing by other synthesis or dsp effects the range of effects that can be produced include amplitude modulation time stretching stereo or multichannel scattering random reordering disintegration and morphing dennis gabor researched how human beings communicate and hear the result of his investigations was the theory of granular synthesis although greek composer iannis xenakis claimed that he was actually the first inventor of this synthesis technique curtis roads is often credited as the first person to implement a digital granular synthesis engine canadian composer barry truax was one of first to implement real time versions of this synthesis technique

pink noise or 1 ƒ noise is a signal or process with a frequency spectrum such that the power spectral density is proportional to the reciprocal of the frequency for pink noise each octave carries an equal amount of noise power the name arises from being intermediate between white noise and red noise within the scientific literature the term 1 ƒ noise is used a little more loosely to refer to any noise with a power spectral density of the formwhere ƒ is frequency and 0 α 2 with α usually close to 1 these 1 ƒ like noises occur widely in nature and are a source of considerable interest in many fields the term flicker noise is sometimes used to refer to 1 ƒ noise although this is more properly applied only to its occurrence in electronic devices due to a direct current mandelbrot and van ness proposed the name fractional noise to emphasise that the exponent of the spectrum could take non integer values and be closely related to fractional brownian motion but the term is very rarely used

cantillation is the ritual chanting of readings from the bible in synagogue services the chants are rendered in accordance with the special signs or marks printed in the masoretic text of the hebrew bible to complement the letters and vowel points these marks are known in english as accents and in hebrew as טעמי המקרא ta amei ha mikra or just טעמים te amim the musical motifs associated with the signs are known in hebrew as niggun and in yiddish as טרא פ trop the equivalent word trope is sometimes used in english with the same meaning a primary purpose of the cantillation signs is to guide the chanting of the sacred texts during public worship very roughly speaking each word of text has a cantillation mark at its primary accent and associated with that mark is a musical phrase that tells how to sing that word the reality is more complex with some words having two or no marks and the musical meaning of some marks dependent upon context there are different sets of musical phrases associated with different sections of the bible the music varies with different jewish traditions and individual cantorial styles the cantillation signs also provide information on the syntactical structure of the text and some say they are a commentary on the text itself highlighting important ideas musically the tropes are not random strings but follow a set and describable grammar the very word ta am means taste or sense the point being that the pauses and intonation denoted by the accents bring out the sense of the passage there are two systems of cantillation marks in the tanakh one is used in the twenty one prose books while the other appears in the three poetical books of psalms proverbs and job except where otherwise stated this article describes the prose system the current system of cantillation notes has its historical roots in the tiberian masorah the cantillation signs are included in unicode as characters 0591 through 05af in the hebrew alphabet block the names of the cantillation signs are not quite the same as between the ashkenazi sephardi italian and yemenite traditions for example sephardim use qadma to mean what ashkenazim call pashta and azla to mean what ashkenazim call qadma in this article as in almost all hebrew grammars the ashkenazi terminology is used

an adsr envelope is a component of many synthesizers samplers and other electronic musical instruments its function is to modulate some aspect of the instrument s sound often its loudness over time the envelope may be a discrete circuit or module or implemented as part of the unit s software when a mechanical musical instrument produces sound the loudness of the sound produced changes over time in a way that varies from instrument to instrument when a pipe organ s key is pressed for example it plays a note at constant volume the sound dies quickly when the key is released by contrast the sound of a guitar is loudest immediately after a string is plucked and quickly fades a synthesizer s adsr envelope is a way to tailor the timbre for the synth sometimes to make it sound more like a mechanical instrument a quick attack with little decay helps it sound more like an organ a longer decay and zero sustain makes it sound more like a guitar while envelopes are most often applied to volume they are also commonly used to control other sound elements such as filter frequencies or oscillator pitches while adsr envelopes are a useful first approximation to the volumes of real instruments they are not a complete substitute woodwind and brass instruments give the player the ability to vary the sound arbitrarily throughout a note for instance many synthesizers therefore offer more flexible facilities for controlling volume on older synthesizers such as the korg ms 20 a common variation on the adsr was adshr by adding a hold parameter the system allowed notes to be held at the sustain level for a length of time before decaying the general instruments ay 3 8912 sound chip included the hold time only the sustain level was not programmable another common variation in the same vein is the ahdsr envelope in which the hold parameter controls how long the envelope stays at full volume before entering the decay phase the adsr was first specified by vladimir ussachevsky in 1965 then head of the columbia princeton electronic music center while suggesting improvements for bob moog s pioneering work on synthesizers an early implementation of adsr can be found on the hammond novachord

melisma in music is the singing of a single syllable of text while moving between several different notes in succession music sung in this style is referred to as melismatic as opposed to syllabic where each syllable of text is matched to a single note music of ancient cultures used melismatic techniques to induce a hypnotic trance in the listener useful for early mystical initiation rites and religious worship this complex quality is still found in pakistani as well as in arabic music where the scale is said to consist of quarter tones orthodox christian chanting also bears a slight resemblance melisma was first interpreted by muslim religious chants and later transported to the hindus in the form of shlokas this is why indian music which has no written tradition later appeared in written form only in the system of arabic poetry middle eastern melismatic music was developed further in the torah chanting as well as by the masoretes in the 7th or 8th century it then appeared in some genres of gregorian chant where it was used in certain sections of the mass with the earliest written appearance around ad 900 the gradual and the alleluia in particular were characteristically melismatic for example while the tract is not and repetitive melodic patterns were deliberately avoided in the style the byzantine rite also used melismatic elements in its music which developed roughly concurrently to the gregorian chant in western music the term melisma most commonly refers to gregorian chant is a group of notes or tones sung on one syllable in plainsong however the term melisma may be used to describe music of any genre including baroque singing and later gospel within jewish liturgical tradition melisma is still commonly used in the chanting of torah readings from the prophets and in the body of the service itself for an examination of the evolution of this tradition see idelsohn the french carol tune gloria arranged by edward shippen barnes in 1937 to which the hymn angels we have heard on high is usually sung contains one of the most melismatic sequences in popular christian hymn music on the o of the word gloria moreover the choral work for unto us a child is born from handel s messiah contains numerous examples of melisma as in the following excerpt the soprano and alto lines engage in a 57 note melisma on the word born melisma is today commonly used in arab middle eastern african balkan and african american music and various asian folk and popular musical genres melisma is also commonly featured in western popular music and is utilized by countless pop artists although this form usually involves improvising melismas over a simpler melody the melisma is a common feature of stevie wonder s music while the trend in r b singers was popularized by mariah carey s vision of love in recent years there has been increased criticism of melisma being abused by singers in part due to the popularity of shows such as american idol and the trend of contestants imitating the artists who popularized the technique

classical music is a broad term that usually refers to mainstream music produced in or rooted in the traditions of western liturgical and secular music encompassing a broad period from roughly the 9th century to present times the central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900 which is known as the common practice period european music is largely distinguished from many other non european and popular musical forms by its system of staff notation in use since about the 16th century western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the pitch speed meter individual rhythms and exact execution of a piece of music this leaves less room for practices such as improvisation and ad libitum ornamentation that are frequently heard in non european art music and popular music the public taste for and appreciation of formal music of this type waned in the late 1900s in the united states and united kingdom in particular certainly this period has seen classical music falling well behind the immense commercial success of popular music in the opinion of some although the number of cds sold is not indicative of the popularity of classical music the term classical music did not appear until the early 19th century in an attempt to canonize the period from johann sebastian bach to beethoven as a golden age the earliest reference to classical music recorded by the oxford english dictionary is from about 1836 many writers feel that classical is an inappropriate term for mainstream and avant garde music written since the latter part of the 19th century hence the common usage of scare quotes

the telharmonium was an early electronic musical instrument developed by thaddeus cahill in 1897 the telharmonium was intended to be listened to using telephone receivers like the later hammond organ the telharmonium used tonewheels to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by additive synthesis an authoritative history of the telharmonium is the book magic music from the telharmonium by reynold weidenaar scarecrow press 1995 weidenaar produced a 29 minute documentary video also called magic music from the telharmonium magnetic music publishing co 1998 the mark i version weighed 7 tons the mark ii version weighed almost 200 tons cahill built three versions in total each one being a considerable advancement over the features of its predecessor a small number of performances in front of a live audience were given in addition to the telephone transmissions performances in new york were well received by the public in 1906 and the performer would sit at a console to control the instrument the actual mechanism of the instrument itself was so large it occupied an entire room wires from the controlling console were fed discreetly through holes in the floor of an auditorium into the instrument room itself which was housed in the basement beneath the concert hall the telharmonium foreshadowed modern electronic musical equipment in a number of ways for instance its sound output came in the form of connecting ordinary telephone receivers to large paper cones a primitive form of loudspeaker indeed cahill was noted for saying that electromagnetic diaphragms were the most preferable means of outputting its distinctive sound although no recordings exist of the telharmonium observers reported that its sound was very clear and pure probably referring to the sine tones it was capable of producing however it was not restricted to such simple sounds each tonewheel of the instrument corresponded to a single note and to broaden its possibilities cahill added several extra tonewheels to add harmonics to each note this combined with organ like stops and multiple keyboards as well as a number of foot pedals meant that every sound could be sculpted and reshaped the instrument was noted for its ability to reproduce the sounds of common orchestral woodwind instruments such as the flute bassoon clarinet and also the cello the telharmonium s demise came for a number of reasons its immense size weight and power consumption caused obvious problems in addition problems began to arise when telephone broadcasts of telharmonium music were subject to crosstalk and unsuspecting telephone users would be interrupted by strange electronic music by 1912 interest in this revolutionary instrument had waned and cahill s company was later declared bankrupt in 1914

in mathematics catastrophe theory is a branch of bifurcation theory in the study of dynamical systems it is also a particular special case of more general singularity theory in geometry bifurcation theory studies and classifies phenomena characterized by sudden shifts in behavior arising from small changes in circumstances analysing how the qualitative nature of equation solutions depends on the parameters that appear in the equation this may lead to sudden and dramatic changes for example the unpredictable timing and magnitude of a landslide catastrophe theory which originated with the work of the french mathematician rené thom in the 1960s and became very popular due to the efforts of christopher zeeman in the 1970s considers the special case where the long run stable equilibrium can be identified with the minimum of a smooth well defined potential function small changes in certain parameters of a nonlinear system can cause equilibria to appear or disappear or to change from attracting to repelling and vice versa leading to large and sudden changes of the behaviour of the system however examined in a larger parameter space catastrophe theory reveals that such bifurcation points tend to occur as part of well defined qualitative geometrical structures

two basses for gordon in october 1986 he began working as their sound engineer since then languedoc built exclusively for the two and his designs and traditional wood choices have given phish a unique instrumental identity recently however languedoc has begun crafting guitars on custom order and on a very limited basis to the general public through local music shops as his senior project anastasio penned the man who stepped into yesterday a nine song concept album that would become their second studio experiment recorded between 1987 and 1988 it was submitted in july of that year accompanied by a written thesis elements of the story known as gamehendge grew to include an additional eight songs the band performed the suite in concert on five occasions in 1988 1991 1993 and twice in 1994 without replicating the song list beginning in the spring of 1988 the band began practicing in earnest sometimes locking themselves in a room and jamming for hours on end dubbed okipa ceremonies one such jam took place at anastasio s apartment and a second was at paul languedoc s house in august 1989 the band attributes the sessions to anastasio who discovered the concept in the films a man

language the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band for instance if anastasio teased a motif from the simpsons theme song the audience would yell d oh in imitation of homer simpson in 1992 phish introduced collaboration between audience and band called the big ball jam in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit in so doing the audience was helping to create an original composition in an experiment known as the rotation jam each member would switch instruments with the musician on his left on occasion a performance of you enjoy myself involved gordon and anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers on mini trampolines while playing their instruments phish along with

capoeira is an afro brazilian art form that makes a ritual of movements from martial arts games and dance it was brought to brazil from angola some time after the 16th century in the regions known as bahia pernambuco and rio de janeiro participants form a roda or circle and take turns either playing musical instruments singing or ritually sparring in pairs in the center of the circle the game is marked by fluid acrobatic play feints and extensive use of sweeps kicks and headbutts less frequently used techniques include elbow strikes slaps punches and body throws its origins and purpose are a matter of debate with the spectrum of argument ranging from views of capoeira as a uniquely brazilian folk dance with improvised fighting movements to claims that it is a battle ready fighting form directly descended from ancient african techniques 
capoeira s origins are very clear it is a combination of african and brazilian martial arts but camps are generally divided between those who believe it is a direct descendant of african fighting styles and those who believe it is a uniquely brazilian dance form distilled from various african and brazilian influences the one popular theory is that it is an african fighting style that was developed in brazil this theory is further supported by a mestre named salvano who once said capoeira cannot exist without black men but its birthplace is brazil even the etymology of capoeira is debated the portuguese word capão means capon or a castrated rooster and could mean that the style appears similar to two roosters fighting kongo scholar k kia bunseki fu kiau also suggested capoeira could be derived from the kikongo word kipura which describes a rooster s movements in a fight afro brazilian scholar carlos eugenio has suggested that the sport took its name from a large round basket called a capa commonly worn on the head by urban slaves others claim the term derives from the tupi guarani words kaá and puéra meaning formerly a forest another claim is that given that capoeira in portuguese literally means chicken coop it could simply be a derisive term used by slave owners to refer to the displays as chicken fights

intermedia was a concept employed in the mid sixties by fluxus artist dick higgins to describe the ineffable often confusing inter disciplinary activities that occur between genres that became prevalent in the 1960s thus the areas such as those between drawing and poetry or between painting and theater could be described as intermedia with repeated occurrences these new genres between genres could develop their own names higgins described the tendency of the most interesting and best in the new art to cross the boundaries of recognized media or even to fuse the boundaries of art with media that had not previously been considered art forms including computers part of the reason that duchamp s objects are fascinating while picasso s voice is fading is that the duchamp pieces are truly between media between sculpture and something else while a picasso is readily classifiable as a painted ornament similarly by invading the land between collage and photography the german john heartfield produced the what are probably the greatest graphics of our century with characteristic modesty he often noted that samuel taylor coleridge had first used the term in 1968 hans breder founded the first university program in the united states to offer an m f a in intermedia the intermedia area at the university of iowa graduated artists such as ana mendieta and charles ray in addition the program developed a substantial visiting artist tradition bringing artists such as dick higgins vito acconci allan kaprow karen finley robert wilson and others to work directly with intermedia students over the years especially on the iowa campus intermedia has been used interchangeably with multi media however recently the latter term has become identified with mixed media in the arts and electronic media in pop culture while intermedia values both disciplines the term intermedia has become the preferred term for interdisciplinary practice two other prominent university programs focusing on intermedia practice are the intermedia program at arizona state university and the intermedia m f a at the university of maine founded and directed by fluxus expert and author owen smith

at the turn of the 20th century classical music was characteristically late romantic in style while at the same time the impressionist movement spearheaded by claude debussy was taking form america began forming its own vernacular style of classical music notably in the works of charles ives john alden carpenter and george gershwin while in vienna arnold schoenberg conceived atonality and later developed the twelve tone technique classical music in the 20th century varied greatly from the expressionism of early schoenberg neoclassical music of igor stravinsky the futurism of luigi russolo alexander mossolov early prokofiev and antheil to the microtonal music of julián carrillo alois hába harry partch and ben johnston to the socialist realism of late prokofiev and glière kabalevsky and other russian composers as well as the simple harmonies and rhythms of minimalist composers such as steve reich and philip glass to the musique concrète of pierre schaeffer and the intuitive music of karlheinz stockhausen from the total serialism of pierre boulez and the political commitment of luigi nono to the aleatoric music of john cage perhaps the most salient feature during this time period of classical music was the increased use of dissonance because of this the twentieth century is sometimes called the dissonant period of classical music following the common practice period which emphasized consonance the watershed transitional moment was the international paris exposition celebrating the centennial of the french revolution in 1889 while some writers hold that debussy s prélude à l après midi d un faune and schoenberg s verklärte nacht are dramatic departures from romanticism and have strong modernist traits others hold that the schoenberg work is squarely within the late romantic tradition of wagner and brahms and more generally that the composer who most directly and completely connects late wagner and the twentieth century is arnold schoenberg an important feature of twentieth century concert music is the splitting of the audience into traditional and avant garde with many figures prominent in one world considered minor or unacceptable in the other composers such as anton webern elliott carter edgard varèse milton babbitt luigi nono and luciano berio have devoted followings within the avant garde but are often attacked outside of it as time has passed however it is increasingly accepted though by no means universally so that the boundaries are more porous than the many polemics would lead one to believe many of the techniques pioneered by the above composers show up in popular music by the beatles deep purple yes genesis king crimson pink floyd elp mike oldfield enigma vangelis jean michel jarre in film scores and video game music that draw mass audiences it should be kept in mind that this article presents an overview of twentieth century classical music and many of the composers listed under the following trends and movements may not identify exclusively as such and may be considered as participating in different movements for instance at different times during his career igor stravinsky may be considered a romantic modernist neoclassicist and a serialist

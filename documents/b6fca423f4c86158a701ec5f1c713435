<p><b>David Richard Berkowitz</b> (born June 1, 1953), also known as <b>Son of Sam</b> and the <b>.44 Caliber Killer</b>, is an <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</a> <a href="/wiki/Serial_killer" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arsonist" title="Arsonist" class="mw-redirect">arsonist</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after his arrest in August 1977, Berkowitz confessed to killing six people and wounding seven others in the course of eight shootings in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> between 1976 and 1977. He has been imprisoned for the crimes since 1977. His crimes had terrorized New York for a year. Berkowitz subsequently claimed that he was commanded to kill by a <a href="/wiki/Demon" title="Demon">demon</a> who <a href="/wiki/Demonic_possession" title="Demonic possession">possessed</a> his neighbor's dog.</p>
<p>Berkowitz later amended his confession to claim he was the shooter in only two incidents, personally killing three people and wounding a fourth. The other victims were killed, Berkowitz claimed, by members of a violent <a href="/wiki/Satanic" title="Satanic">Satanic</a> <a href="/wiki/Cult" title="Cult">cult</a> of which he was a member. Though he remains the only person charged with or convicted of the shootings, some <a href="/wiki/Law_enforcement" title="Law enforcement">law enforcement</a> authorities argue that Berkowitz's claims are credible: according to <a href="/wiki/John_Hockenberry" title="John Hockenberry">John Hockenberry</a><sup id="cite_ref-hockenberry_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hockenberry-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> formerly of <a href="/wiki/MSNBC" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a>, many officials involved in the original "Son of Sam" case suspected that more than one person was committing the murders. Hockenberry also reported that the Son of Sam case was reopened in 1996 and, as of 2004<sup class="plainlinks noprint asof-tag update" style="display:none;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Berkowitz&amp;action=edit" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Berkowitz&amp;action=edit" rel="nofollow">[update]</a></sup>, it was still considered open.</p>

<p>Berkowitz was born <b>Richard David Falco</b> in <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn,_New_York" title="Brooklyn, New York" class="mw-redirect">Brooklyn, New York</a>. His mother, Betty Broder, was married to Anthony Falco, with whom she had a daughter before the couple separated without legally <a href="/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorcing</a>. After this, she had an affair with the married Joseph Kleinman,<sup id="cite_ref-crimelibrary_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-crimelibrary-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> who fathered a son. Kleinman suggested she <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abort</a> the child, but she gave birth to a boy and listed Falco as the father.</p>
<p>Before he was a week old, the baby was <a href="/wiki/Adoption" title="Adoption">adopted</a> by hardware store owners Nathan and Pearl Berkowitz, who reversed the order of his first and middle names in addition to giving him their own surname.<sup id="cite_ref-crimelibrary_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-crimelibrary-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>John Vincent Sanders wrote that Berkowitz's childhood was "somewhat troubled. Although of above-average intelligence, he lost interest in learning at an early age and began an infatuation with petty <a href="/wiki/Larceny" title="Larceny">larceny</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pyromania" title="Pyromania">pyromania</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Berkowitz's adoptive mother died of <a href="/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a> when he was thirteen, and his home life became strained in later years, particularly because he disliked his adoptive father's second wife. He later claimed his new step-sister was interested in <a href="/wiki/Witchcraft" title="Witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, sparking an interest in the <a href="/wiki/Occult" title="Occult">occult</a> he would later pursue more actively.</p>
<p>In 1969, the 16-year-old Berkowitz attended the <a href="/wiki/Woodstock_Festival" title="Woodstock Festival">Woodstock Festival</a>. He joined the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> in 1971, served on <a href="/wiki/Active_duty" title="Active duty">active duty</a> until his <a href="/wiki/Honorable_discharge" title="Honorable discharge" class="mw-redirect">honorable discharge</a> in 1974. He avoided service in the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, instead serving in both the United States and <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>.</p>
<p>In 1974 Berkowitz located his birth mother, Betty Falco. After a few visits, she disclosed the details of his illegitimate <a href="/wiki/Conception_(biology)" title="Conception (biology)" class="mw-redirect">conception</a> and birth, which greatly disturbed him. They fell out of contact, but Berkowitz did stay in touch with his half-sister, Roslyn.<sup id="cite_ref-crimelibrary_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-crimelibrary-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After leaving the Army, Berkowitz held several <a href="/wiki/Blue_collar" title="Blue collar" class="mw-redirect">blue collar</a> jobs.

<p>Berkowitz claims that he joined a <a href="/wiki/Cult" title="Cult">cult</a> in the spring of 1975.

Gradually, however, Berkowitz claimed that the group introduced him to <a href="/wiki/Drug_use" title="Drug use">drug use</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sadism" title="Sadism">sadistic pornography</a> and violent crime. They began, he claims, by killing dogs, mostly <a href="/wiki/German_Shepherd" title="German Shepherd" class="mw-redirect">German Shepherds</a>.

Their daughter Donna, 18, and her friend Jody Valenti, 19, were sitting in Valenti's <a href="/wiki/Oldsmobile" title="Oldsmobile">Oldsmobile</a>, parked outside the apartment, discussing their evening at the Peachtree, a <a href="/wiki/New_Rochelle" title="New Rochelle" class="mw-redirect">New Rochelle</a> <a href="/wiki/Discotheque" title="Discotheque" class="mw-redirect">discotheque</a>. As Valenti was about to leave, Mike Lauria agreed to his daughter's suggestion that they walk the family's dog together. Before he went inside to retrieve the poodle, Lauria noticed a man sleeping in a yellow <a href="/wiki/Compact_car" title="Compact car">compact car</a> parked across the street and about sixty feet behind his own car. Neighbors would report to police that an unfamiliar yellow <a href="/wiki/Compact_car" title="Compact car">compact car</a> had been cruising the area for hours before the shooting.<sup id="cite_ref-terry2325_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-terry2325-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After her parents were inside, Donna Lauria opened the car door to depart, noticing a man quickly approaching them. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, Lauria said, "Now what is this…"<sup id="cite_ref-terry2325_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-terry2325-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> From the paper sack he carried, the man produced a handgun and, crouching as he aimed, fired three shots. Lauria was struck in her chest by one bullet that killed her almost instantly, Valenti took a bullet in her <a href="/wiki/Thigh" title="Thigh">thigh</a>, and the third missed both girls. The shooter turned and quickly walked away.</p>
<p>Valenti, who survived her injuries, said she did not recognize the killer. She described him as a white male in his 30s with a fair complexion, standing about 5'9" and weighing about 160&#160;lb (73&#160;kg). His hair was short, dark and curly in a "<a href="/wiki/Mod_(lifestyle)" title="Mod (lifestyle)">mod</a> style."<sup id="cite_ref-terry2325_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-terry2325-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> This description was echoed by Mike Lauria in his description of the man who was sitting in the yellow compact car parked behind Valenti and Lauria.</p>
<p>Detectives from the 8th Homicide precinct of the <a href="/wiki/New_York_Police_Department" title="New York Police Department" class="mw-redirect">New York Police Department</a> had little in the way of evidence. Most importantly, they were able to determine that the handgun used was a <a href="/wiki/.44_Special" title=".44 Special">.44 caliber</a> <a href="/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog" title="Charter Arms Bulldog">Charter Arms Bulldog</a>. A high-power, five-shot <a href="/wiki/Revolver" title="Revolver">revolver</a> intended for use in close quarters, the .44 Bulldog was identified because the unusual manufacturing process of its barrel left distinctive marks on each slug.</p>
<p>Police followed two working <a href="/wiki/Hypothesis" title="Hypothesis">hypotheses</a> in the absence of further <a href="/wiki/Evidence" title="Evidence">evidence</a>: that the shooter was a spurned admirer of the popular Lauria or that the shooting was a mistaken <a href="/wiki/Assassination" title="Assassination">assassination</a> attempt of the wrong person. The neighborhood had seen recent <a href="/wiki/Mafia" title="Mafia">mob</a> activity, and police even hinted that Mike Lauria, a member of the <a href="/wiki/Teamsters" title="Teamsters">Teamsters</a> union, might be involved in <a href="/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">organized crime</a>.</p>
<p>Berkowitz later claimed that he shot Lauria and Valenti, and that several other cult members were involved in the crime, either by <a href="/wiki/Surveillance" title="Surveillance">surveillance</a> of the victims, or by acting as lookouts.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the early morning of October 23, 1976, another shooting occurred, this time in <a href="/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a>.</p>
<p>Carl Denaro, 25, and Rosemary Keenan, 38, were parked in a secluded residential area in <a href="/wiki/Flushing,_Queens" title="Flushing, Queens">Flushing, Queens</a>. Keenan was driving her own <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle" title="Volkswagen Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a>, and Denaro was in the passenger seat. At about 1:30 a.m., the car's windows seemed to explode, and the duo dropped low in their seats as several bullets struck the car. Denaro and Keenan did not realize someone was shooting at them, even as Denaro was bleeding from a bullet wound to his head. They panicked and Keenan drove to Peck's, a bar about half a mile away. Keenan had only superficial injuries from the broken glass, but Denaro eventually needed a metal plate to replace a portion of his <a href="/wiki/Skull" title="Skull">skull</a>. Neither victim had seen whoever had made the attack.</p>
<p>Police determined that the slugs embedded in Keenan's car were .44 caliber bullets, but they were so damaged and deformed that they thought it was unlikely that they could ever be linked to a particular weapon.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Denaro had shoulder-length hair, and police would later speculate that the shooter had mistaken him for a girl. Keenan's father was a 20-year veteran police detective of the <a href="/wiki/NYPD" title="NYPD" class="mw-redirect">NYPD</a>, spurring an in-depth investigation. As with the Lauria-Valenti shooting, however, there seemed to be no motive for the shooting, and police made little progress in the case. Though many details of the Denaro-Keenan shooting were very similar to the Lauria-Valenti case, police did not initially suspect a connection, partly because the shootings occurred in different boroughs of New York City and were investigated by different local police agencies.</p>
<p>Berkowitz later claimed that, while he observed and helped plan the crime, an unnamed female cult member actually shot Denaro.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The victims survived primarily, claimed Berkowitz, because the shooter was unfamiliar with the powerful <a href="/wiki/Recoil" title="Recoil">recoil</a> of a .44 Bulldog.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Late in the evening of November 26, 1976, Donna DeMasi, 16, and Joanne Lomino, 18, had walked home from a movie, and were chatting under a streetlight outside Lomino's home. A man approached to within about ten feet of the girls. They later described him as about 5'9", tall and slender, weighing perhaps 150&#160;lb (68&#160;kg) with straight, dirty blond hair and dark eyes. He wore a slim, knee-length coat reminiscent of military surplus gear.</p>
<p>Startled but not frightened by his sudden appearance, DeMasi and Lomino suspected the man was lost and asking directions. In a high-pitched voice he said, "Can you tell me how to get,"<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> then he produced a revolver. He shot each of the victims once, and as they fell to the ground injured, he fired several more times, striking the apartment building before running away. Having heard the gunshots, a neighbor rushed from their apartment and saw the blonde shooter rush by, gripping a pistol in his left hand.</p>
<p>DeMasi and Lomino were hospitalized with serious injuries: Lomino was ultimately rendered a <a href="/wiki/Paraplegic" title="Paraplegic" class="mw-redirect">paraplegic</a>, but DeMasi's wounds were less serious.</p>
<p>Based on the testimony of DeMasi, Lomino, and their neighbor, police produced several <a href="/wiki/Composite_sketch" title="Composite sketch" class="mw-redirect">composite sketches</a> of the blonde shooter. Police also determined the gun was a .44, but the slugs were so deformed that linking them to a particular gun was all but ruled out.</p>
<p>Berkowitz later claimed that while he helped plan the DeMasi-Lomino shooting, the actual perpetrator was cult member John Carr, and that a Yonkers police officer, also a cult member, was involved in the crime.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The new year brought more shootings in Queens. In the early morning of January 30, 1977, an engaged couple, Christine Freund, 26, and John Diel, 30, were sitting in Diel's <a href="/wiki/Pontiac_Firebird" title="Pontiac Firebird">Pontiac Firebird</a>, preparing to drive to a dance hall after having seen the motion picture <i><a href="/wiki/Rocky" title="Rocky">Rocky</a></i>.</p>
<p>Three gunshots penetrated the car at about 12:40 a.m. In a panic, Diel drove away for help. He suffered minor superficial injuries, but Freund was shot twice. She died several hours later at the hospital. Neither victim had seen their attacker(s).</p>
<p>Police determined the shooter had again used a .44 <a href="/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog" title="Charter Arms Bulldog">Bulldog</a>. Police made the first public acknowledgment that the Freund-Diel shooting was similar to the earlier cases, and that the crimes might be connected: the earlier victims had been struck with .44 shells, if not confirmed Bulldog revolvers, and the shootings targeted young women with long, dark hair and/or young couples parked in cars.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/NYPD" title="NYPD" class="mw-redirect">NYPD</a> <a href="/wiki/Sergeant#United_States" title="Sergeant">sergeant</a> Richard Conlon stated that police were "leaning towards a connection in all these cases."<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated3_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated3-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Composite sketches of the black-haired Lauria-Valenti shooter and the blonde Lomino-DeMasi shooter were released, and Conlon noted that police were looking for multiple "suspects", not just one.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated3_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated3-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Berkowitz later claimed that while "at least five" cult members were at the scene of the Freund-Diel shooting, the actual shooter was a cult associate nicknamed "<a href="/wiki/Charles_Manson" title="Charles Manson">Manson</a> II", who was brought in from outside New York due to a special motive of which Berkowitz claimed to know no details.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated8_7-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated8-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>At about 7:30 p.m. on March 8, 1977, <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> student Virginia Voskerichian, 19, was walking home from school. She lived about a block from where Christine Freund was shot. The Voskerichian shooting differed from the other Son of Sam crimes in many respects. All the other victims were couples, and were shot on weekends in the late night or early morning.</p>
<p>There were no direct witnesses to the Voskerichian murder, which happened on the victim's own street. In a desperate move to defend herself, Voskerichian lifted her textbooks between herself and her killer, only to have the makeshift shield penetrated, the bullet striking her head and killing her.</p>
<p>Moments after the shooting, a neighborhood resident who had heard the gunshots was rounding the corner onto Voskerichian's street. He nearly collided with a person he described as a short, husky boy, 16 to 18 years old and clean-shaven, wearing a sweater and watch cap, who was sprinting away from the crime scene. The neighbor said the youth pulled the cap over his face and said, "Oh, Jesus!" as he passed by, sprinting.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated4_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated4-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Other neighbors claimed to have seen the "teenager," and another matching Berkowitz's description, loitering separately in the area for about an hour before the shooting.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated4_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated4-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> In the following days, the media repeated police claims that this "chubby teenager" was the suspect in the shooting.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated4_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated4-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In a March 10, 1977 <a href="/wiki/Press_conference" title="Press conference" class="mw-redirect">press conference</a>, NYPD officials and <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City" title="Mayor of New York City">New York City Mayor</a> <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Beame" title="Abraham Beame">Abraham Beame</a> declared that the same .44 Bulldog revolver had fired the shots that killed Lauria and Voskerichian.<sup id="cite_ref-terry3840_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-terry3840-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Official documents would later surface, however, saying that while police strongly suspected the same .44 Bulldog had been used in the shootings, the evidence was actually inconclusive.<sup id="cite_ref-terry3840_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-terry3840-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The same day, the Operation Omega <a href="/wiki/Task_force" title="Task force">task force</a> made its public debut. Charged solely with investigating the .44 Caliber shootings, the task force was led by Deputy Inspector Timothy J. Dowd, composed of over 300 police officers. Police speculated that the killer had a vendetta against women, perhaps due to <a href="/wiki/Social_rejection" title="Social rejection">chronic social rejection</a>, and also declared that the "chubby teenager" was regarded as a witness, not a suspect in the Voskerichian shooting. The police regarded the taller, black-haired male shooter in the Lauria-Valenti case as the shooter in all the .44 Caliber murders.</p>

You can forget about me if you like because I don't care for publicity. However you must not forget Donna Lauria and you cannot let the people forget her either. She was a very, very sweet girl but Sam's a thirsty lad and he won't let me stop killing until he gets his fill of blood. Mr. Breslin, sir, don't think that because you haven't heard from me for a while that I went to sleep. No, rather, I am still here. Like a spirit roaming the night. Thirsty, hungry, seldom stopping to rest; anxious to please Sam. I love my work. Now, the void has been filled. Perhaps we shall meet face to face someday or perhaps I will be blown away by cops with smoking .38's. Whatever, if I shall be fortunate enough to meet you I will tell you all about Sam if you like and I will introduce you to him. His name is "Sam the terrible." Not knowing the what the future holds I shall say farewell and I will see you at the next job. Or should I say you will see my handiwork at the next job? Remember Ms. Lauria. Thank you. In their blood and from the gutter "Sam's creation" .44 Here are some names to help you along. Forward them to the inspector for use by N.C.I.C: [sic] "The Duke of Death" "The Wicked King Wicker" "The Twenty Two Disciples of Hell" "John 'Wheaties' -- Rapist and Suffocator of Young Girls. PS: Please inform all the detectives working the slaying to remain. P.S: [sic] JB, Please inform all the detectives working the case that I wish them the best of luck. "Keep 'em digging, drive on, think positive, get off your butts, knock on coffins, etc." Upon my capture I promise to buy all the guys working the case a new pair of shoes if I can get up the money. Son of Sam<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Breslin notified police, who thought the letter was probably from someone with knowledge of the shootings.

<p>It was near the one-year anniversary of the first .44 caliber shootings, and police set up a sizable <a href="/wiki/Dragnet_(policing)" title="Dragnet (policing)">dragnet</a>, focusing on past hunting grounds of <a href="/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Bronx" title="The Bronx">The Bronx</a>. However, the next .44 shooting was in <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>.</p>
<p>Early on July 31, 1977, Stacy Moskowitz and Robert Violente, both 20, were in Violente's car, which was parked under a streetlight near a city park. They were kissing when a man approached to within about three feet of the passenger side of Violente's car, fired several gunshots into the car, striking both victims in the head, before running into the park. Moskowitz died several hours later in the hospital. Violente survived, though one of his eyes was destroyed and he retained only very limited vision in the other eye. With her short, curly blonde hair, Moskowitz was a departure from the other female victims. Based on telephone calls to police within seconds of the shooting, the crime occurred at 2:35 a.m.</p>
<p>The Moskowitz-Violente crime produced more witnesses than any of the other Son of Sam murders, notably the only direct eyewitness who was not an intended victim. During the shooting, Tommy Zaino, 19, was parked with his date in a car three car lengths ahead of Violente's. Moments before the shooting, Zaino saw a peripheral glimpse of the shooter's approach and happened to glance in his rear view mirror just in time to see the crime occur. Due to the bright street light and full moon, Zaino clearly saw the perpetrator for several seconds, later describing him as 25 to 30 years old, of average height (5'7" to 5'9") with shaggy hair that was dark blonde or light brown — "it looked like a <a href="/wiki/Wig_(hair)" title="Wig (hair)" class="mw-redirect">wig</a>", Zaino said.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>About a minute after the shooting, a woman seated next to her boyfriend in his car on the other side of the city park saw a "white male [who was wearing] a light-colored, cheap nylon wig" sprint from the park and enter a "small, light-colored" auto, which drove away quickly.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> "He looks like he just robbed a bank," said the woman, who wrote what she could see of the car's <a href="/wiki/License_plate" title="License plate" class="mw-redirect">license plate</a>: unable to determine the first two characters, she was certain the others were either 4-GUR or 4-GVR.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_24-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Other witnesses included a woman who saw a light car speed away from the park about 20 seconds after the gunshots,<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_24-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> and at least two witnesses who described a yellow <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen" title="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> driving quickly from the neighborhood with its headlights off.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> A neighborhood resident given the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> Mary Lyons heard the gunshots and Violente's calls for help, and glancing from her apartment window, she saw a man she later positively identified as Berkowitz, who was walking casually <i>away</i> from the crime scene as many others were rushing <i>towards</i> the scene to render aid.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly after 2:35 a.m., a man given the <a href="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a> Alan Masters was passing through an intersection a few blocks from the park. Masters was nearly struck by what he described as a yellow <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle" title="Volkswagen Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a> that sped through the intersection, against the red light and without headlights, with the driver holding his door shut with his arm as he drove. Angered and alarmed, Masters followed the Volkswagen at high speed for several minutes before losing sight of the vehicle. Masters described the driver as a white male in his late 20s or early 30s, with a narrow face; dark, long, stringy hair; several days growth of dark whiskers on his face; and wearing a blue jacket.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> Upset, Masters neglected to note the Volkswagen's license plate number, but he thought it might have been a <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> rather than a <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> plate. Violente encountered a very similar man as he and Moskowitz were in the park shortly before the shooting, describing him as a "grubby-looking <a href="/wiki/Hippy" title="Hippy" class="mw-redirect">hippy</a>" with whiskers, wiry hair over his forehead, dark eyes, and wearing a <a href="/wiki/Denim" title="Denim">denim</a> jacket.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Police didn't learn of the Moskowitz-Violente shooting until about 2:50 a.m., and Dowd didn't think it was another Son of Sam shooting until an officer at the scene reported that large-caliber shells had been used.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>About an hour after the shooting, police set up a series of roadblocks, stopping hundreds of cars to question drivers and inspect vehicles. Based on extended interviews of Masters and others who described a Volkswagen speeding from the crime scene, police now suspected that the shooter owned or drove such a vehicle. In subsequent days, police determined there were over 900 Volkswagens in New York or New Jersey, and they made plans to track down each of these cars and their owners.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The evening of the Moskowitz and Violante shooting, Cacilia Davis, who lived near the crime scene, saw Berkowitz loitering in the neighborhood and glaring menacingly at passersby for several hours before removing a <a href="/wiki/Parking_ticket" title="Parking ticket" class="mw-redirect">parking ticket</a> from his yellow Ford Galaxie, which had been parked too close to a <a href="/wiki/Fire_hydrant" title="Fire hydrant">fire hydrant</a>. Two days after the shooting, she contacted police.</p>
<p>Despite their claims to the contrary, police initially thought Berkowitz a possible witness, rather than a suspect. Not until August 9, 1977, seven days after Cacilia Davis informed police about the man with the parking ticket, did <a href="/wiki/NYPD" title="NYPD" class="mw-redirect">NYPD</a> <a href="/wiki/Detective" title="Detective">Detective</a> James Justis telephone Yonkers police to ask them to schedule an interview with Berkowitz.

<p>Justis asked "the [Yonkers] police for some help tracking [Berkowitz] down. Mike Novotny was a sergeant at the Yonkers Police Department. According to Novotny, the Yonkers police had their own suspicions about Berkowitz, in connection with other strange crimes in Yonkers, crimes they saw referenced in one of the Son of Sam letters. To the shock of the NYPD they told the New York City detective that Berkowitz might just be the Son of Sam."<sup id="cite_ref-hockenberry_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hockenberry-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The next day, police investigated Berkowitz's car parked on the street outside his Pine Street apartment in Yonkers. Police saw a Commando Mark III rifle in the backseat. Searching the car, police found a <a href="/wiki/Duffel_bag" title="Duffel bag">duffel bag</a> filled with ammunition, maps of the crime scenes and a letter to Sgt. Dowd of the Omega task force, threatening further murders. Police decided to wait for Berkowitz to emerge from the apartment rather than risk a violent encounter in the narrow apartment hallway.</p>
<p>Berkowitz emerged from the building shortly before 10:00 p.m., carrying a .44 Bulldog in a paper sack. Police arrested Berkowitz as he was starting the car outside his apartment on Pine Street in Yonkers on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1977-08-10"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="08-10"><a href="/wiki/August_10" title="August 10">August 10</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1977" title="1977">1977</a></span>.

What took you so long?"<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Police searched his apartment, and found it in disarray, with Satanic <a href="/wiki/Graffiti" title="Graffiti">graffiti</a> on the walls. They also found a <a href="/wiki/Diary" title="Diary">diary</a> wherein Berkowitz took credit for dozens of <a href="/wiki/Arson" title="Arson">arsons</a> throughout the New York area (some sources allege that this number might be as high as 1,411).<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Police were worried that, if challenged in court, their initial search of Berkowitz's vehicle might be ruled <a href="/wiki/Unconstitutional" title="Unconstitutional" class="mw-redirect">unconstitutional</a>. Police had no <a href="/wiki/Search_warrant" title="Search warrant">search warrant</a>, and their justification for the search of Berkowitz's car might seem flimsy. They had searched initially based on the <a href="/wiki/Rifle" title="Rifle">rifle</a> visible in the back seat, though possession of such a rifle was legal in New York State, and required no special permit.</p>
<p>Berkowitz quickly confessed to the shootings, however, and expressed an interest in <a href="/wiki/Plea_bargain" title="Plea bargain">pleading guilty</a> in exchange for receiving <a href="/wiki/Life_imprisonment" title="Life imprisonment">life imprisonment</a> rather than facing the <a href="/wiki/Death_penalty" title="Death penalty" class="mw-redirect">death penalty</a>. Berkowitz was questioned for about 30 minutes in the early morning of August 11, 1977, and he quickly confessed to the "Son of Sam" killings.</p>
<p>During questioning, Berkowitz said that the "Sam" mentioned in the first letter was Sam Carr, his former neighbor. Berkowitz claimed that Carr's <a href="/wiki/Labrador_retriever" title="Labrador retriever" class="mw-redirect">labrador retriever</a> dog, Harvey, was possessed by an ancient demon, and that it issued irresistible commands that Berkowitz must kill people. Berkowitz said he once tried to kill the dog, but was unsuccessful due to <a href="/wiki/Supernatural" title="Supernatural">supernatural</a> interference.</p>

<p>During his sentencing, Berkowitz repeatedly chanted "Stacy was a <a href="/wiki/Whore" title="Whore" class="mw-redirect">whore</a>" at a low yet audible volume.<sup id="cite_ref-Terry_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terry-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> He was referring, presumably, to Stacy Moskowitz, who died in the final .44 caliber shooting.

<p>On June 12, 1978, he was sentenced to six life sentences in prison for the murders, making his maximum term 365 years. He was first imprisoned at the <a href="/wiki/Attica_Correctional_Facility" title="Attica Correctional Facility">Attica Correctional Facility</a>.</p>

<p>In 1979, there was an attempt on Berkowitz's life. He refused to identify the person(s) who had attacked him with a knife, but suggested that the act was directed by the cult he once belonged to. He bears a permanent scar from the wound that took 52 stitches to close.</p>
<p>In 1987, Berkowitz became a <a href="/wiki/Born_again_Christianity" title="Born again Christianity" class="mw-redirect">born again</a> <a href="/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> in prison. According to his personal testimony, his moment of <a href="/wiki/Religious_conversion" title="Religious conversion">conversion</a> occurred after reading <a href="/wiki/Psalms" title="Psalms">Psalm 34:6</a> from a <a href="/wiki/Gideons_International" title="Gideons International">Gideon's Pocket Testament Bible</a> given to him by a fellow inmate.<sup id="cite_ref-forgiven_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-forgiven-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> In the same testimony, he stated that his obsession with and heavy involvement in the occult played a major role in the Son of Sam murders.</p>

The parole board saw that he had a good record in the prison programs, but decided that the brutality of his crimes called for him to stay imprisoned. In July 2006, the board once again denied parole on similar grounds, with Berkowitz not in attendance at the hearing.

<p>One major side effect of Berkowitz's murder spree were the "<a href="/wiki/Son_of_Sam_law" title="Son of Sam law">Son of Sam laws</a>" enacted in several states in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The first of these laws was enacted in New York state after rampant speculation about publishers offering Berkowitz large sums of money for his story. The new law, named for Berkowitz, authorized the state to seize all money earned from such a deal from a criminal for five years, with intentions to use the seized money to compensate victims.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks of his arrest, Berkowitz was hinting that others were involved in the .44 murders. In a letter to the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i> dated September 19, 1977, Berkowitz repeated the possessed dog story, but closed out his missive with the warning, "There are other Sons out there, God help the world."<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In later years, he has discussed the cult claims in greater detail, but alleges that he cannot divulge all he knows without putting his family at risk. The cult had roughly two dozen core members in New York, the "twenty-two disciples of hell" mentioned in the Breslin letter. The cult had ties across the U.S., claimed Berkowitz, and was deeply involved in <a href="/wiki/Drug_smuggling" title="Drug smuggling" class="mw-redirect">drug smuggling</a> and other illegal activities. Berkowitz reportedly invited the former <a href="/wiki/Priest" title="Priest">priest</a> and <a href="/wiki/Exorcist" title="Exorcist">exorcist</a> <a href="/wiki/Malachi_Martin" title="Malachi Martin">Malachi Martin</a> to visit him to discuss his past Satanic cult involvement.<sup id="cite_ref-martin_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-martin-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Hockenberry asserts that, even aside from the Satanic cult claims, many officials doubted the single-shooter theory, writing, "[w]hat most don't know about the Son of Sam case is that from the beginning, not everyone bought the idea that Berkowitz acted alone. The list of skeptics includes both the police who worked the case and the prosecutor from Queens where five of the shootings took place."<sup id="cite_ref-hockenberry_0-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hockenberry-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Journalist Maury Terry began investigating the Son of Sam shootings before Berkowitz was arrested. Doubtful of the single shooter theory favored by police, Terry dug deeper into the case, noting a number of unresolved questions and inconsistencies that he first publicized in a March 1978 newspaper article.</p>
<p>Eventually interviewing Berkowitz several times, Terry uncovered evidence that he argues strongly support the idea that a violent offshoot of the <a href="/wiki/Process_Church" title="Process Church" class="mw-redirect">Process Church</a> was responsible for the Son of Sam murders and many other crimes. After consulting with police and agreeing to withhold some names and other details, Terry publicized his conclusions first in a series of newspaper articles distributed by the <a href="/wiki/Gannett" title="Gannett" class="mw-redirect">Gannett</a> syndicate in 1979, and later in his book <i>The Ultimate Evil</i>, which has been expanded several times since its 1987 publication.<sup id="cite_ref-Terry_36-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Terry-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> Queens' <a href="/wiki/District_attorney" title="District attorney">district attorney</a> John Santucci, who thought the case against Berkowitz was riddled with inconsistencies and unresolved questions, was so impressed with Terry's research that, "he agreed to reopen the Son of Sam case ...

In the <i><a href="/wiki/San_Jose_Mercury_News" title="San Jose Mercury News">San Jose Mercury News</a></i>, Jessie Seyfer noted that "investigators interviewed him in prison and now believe he has nothing of value to offer" regarding the Perry case.<sup id="cite_ref-cct_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cct-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Berkowitz claimed that brothers John and Michael Carr, the real life sons of Yonkers resident Sam Carr, were members of the same Satanic cult. John was the "John Wheaties, rapist and suffocator of young girls" mentioned in the Breslin letter.</p>
<p>Both Carr brothers died within two years of Berkowitz's arrest. John Carr was discovered dead in February 1978 in his girlfriend's <a href="/wiki/North_Dakota" title="North Dakota">North Dakota</a> home; police initially viewed his death as suspicious, but it was ultimately ruled a probable <a href="/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>.

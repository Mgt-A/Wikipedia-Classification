<p><b>Housing in Japan</b> includes modern and traditional styles. Two patterns of residences are predominant in contemporary <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>: the single-family detached <a href="/wiki/House" title="House">house</a> and the multiple-unit building, either owned by an individual or corporation and rented as apartments to tenants, or owned by occupants. In Japan, multiple-unit blocks are referred to as one of two types: 1) Apaato (アパート）older buildings, which are usually only a few stories in height, without a central secure entrance 2) Manshon (マンション) modern buildings with multiple floors, elevators, and a communal secure gate, with centralised postboxes; they are usually more sturdily built than apaato, normally of reinforced concrete (RC) construction<sup id="cite_ref-accomtype_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-accomtype-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>. Additional kinds of housing, especially for unmarried people, include boarding houses (which are popular among college students), dormitories (common in companies), and barracks (for members of the <a href="/wiki/Japan_Self-Defense_Forces" title="Japan Self-Defense Forces">Self-Defense Forces</a>, police and some other public employees).</p>

<p>Figures from the 2003 Housing and Land Survey conducted by the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_and_Communications_(Japan)" title="Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (Japan)" class="mw-redirect">Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications</a> indicate that Japan had 53,891,000 housing units at the time. Of these, 46,863,000 (87.0%) were occupied and 7,028,000 (13.0%) unoccupied. Of the occupied units, 28,666,000 (61.2%) were owned by the resident household, 45,258,000 units (96.6%) were used exclusively for living and 1,605,000 units (3.4%) were used both for living and commercial purposes. The average number of rooms per unit of housing was 4.77, the average total floor area in was 94.85&#160;square meters (28.69 tsubo; 1,021.0&#160;sq&#160;ft) and the average number of people per room was 0.56.<sup id="cite_ref-housestats_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-housestats-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Of the units used exclusively for living, 10,893,000 (24.1%) were equipped with an automatic smoke detector. As of 2003, 17,180,000 housing units (36.7%) are classified by the Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communication as being located in urban areas while 27,553,000 housing units (58.8%) are located in rural areas <sup id="cite_ref-jsy_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jsy-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Traditional Japanese housing does not have a designated utility for each room aside from the entrance area (<i><a href="/wiki/Genkan" title="Genkan">genkan</a>,</i> <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%8E%84%E9%96%A2" class="extiw" title="wikt:玄関">玄関</a>), kitchen, bathroom, and toilet. Any room can be a living room, dining room, study, or bedroom. This is possible because all the necessary furniture is portable, being stored in <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Oshiire&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Oshiire (page does not exist)">oshiire</a></i>, a small section of the house used for storage. It is important to note that in Japanese, living room is expressed as <i>i-ma</i>, living "space". This is because the size of a room can be changed by altering the partitioning. Large traditional houses often have only one ima (living room/space) under the roof, while kitchen, bathroom, and toilet are attached on the side of the house as extensions.</p>
<p>Somewhat similar to modern offices, partitions within the house are created by <i><a href="/wiki/Fusuma" title="Fusuma">fusuma</a></i>, sliding doors made from wood and paper, which are portable and easily removed. Fusuma seal each partition from top to bottom so it can create a mini room within the house. On the edge of a house are <i>rōka</i>, wooden floored passages, that are similar to hallways. Rōka and ima are partitioned by <a href="/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dji" title="Shōji">shōji</a>, sliding and portable doors that are also made from paper and wood. Unlike fusuma, paper used for shōji are very thin so outside light can pass through into the house. This was before glass was used for sliding doors. Rōka and outside of the house are either partitioned by walls or portable wooden boards that are used to seal the house at night. Extended roofs protect the rōka from getting wet when it rains, except during typhoon season where the house gets sealed completely. Roofs of traditional houses in Japan are made of wood and clay, with tiles or thatched areas on top.</p>
<p>For large gatherings, these partitions are removed to create one large meeting room. During a normal day, partitions can create much smaller and more manageable living spaces. Therefore, kitchen, bathroom, toilet, and genkan with one multipurpose living space create one complete Japanese housing unit. However, the bathroom, toilet, and even kitchen can be communal. (See <i><a href="/wiki/Sent%C5%8D" title="Sentō">Sentō</a></i>.) Therefore, the minimum Japanese housing arrangement, which is still possible to find if one is looking for the cheapest room to rent, consists of just genkan and one living room/space.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Housing_in_Japan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Modern homes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Modern homes</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Real_estate" title="Real estate">Real estate</a> advertisements provide a glimpse into the modern Japanese home. Housing is typically listed as 2LDK or 3LDK. L designating living room, D for dining room, and K for kitchen. In this format, the bathroom and toilet are not mentioned but always included. D and K are not really separate: the dining room is part of or next to the kitchen. Therefore, the size and the price of apartments are primarily determined by the number of L, "living rooms". The expression "living room" is slightly deceptive because the living room, though not necessarily decorated in traditional Japanese style with tatami, are presumed to be multipurpose. Therefore, living rooms are used as study rooms, "living rooms", bed (futon) rooms, as well as dining rooms depending on the need of resident(s). Moreover, each "living room" is separated by a removable sliding door, such as fusuma, so living rooms can be one large single room.</p>
<p>Additionally, advertisements quote the sizes of the rooms – most importantly, the living room – with measurements in <i><a href="/wiki/Tatami" title="Tatami">tatami</a></i> mats (<i>jō</i> in Japanese, traditional mats woven from rice straw that are of a standard size: 180&#160;cm by 90&#160;cm in the Tokyo region, and 191&#160;cm by 95.5&#160;cm in western Japan): "2DK; one six-<i>tatami</i> Japanese-style room, one six-<i>tatami</i> Western-style room" is an example.</p>
<p>The layout of a typical apartment varies, but entry is usually into the DK (dining/kitchen), while the other rooms are behind it. In larger dwellings, one or more rooms may also be accessed by the hallway before reaching the kitchen area. The toilet is located adjacent to the "DK", as is the larger "ofuro/bath" room.</p>
<p>Though commonly accepted standards for description exist, this is not a legal requirement, therefore descriptions may not be entirely accurate.</p>

<p>One characteristic of a Japanese home is the <i><a href="/wiki/Genkan" title="Genkan">genkan</a></i>, or entryway. It includes a small area, at the same level as the outside, where arriving people remove their shoes. As they take off their shoes, people step up onto a raised floor. They point the tips of their shoes to the outside. The rest of the residence is at the raised level of this floor. Adjacent to the lower floor is a shelf or cabinet called a <i><a href="/wiki/Getabako" title="Getabako">getabako</a></i> in which people may place their shoes. Slippers for wear in the home are also stored there.</p>

<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Toilets_in_Japan" title="Toilets in Japan">Toilets in Japan</a></div>
<p>The toilet in Japanese housing is located away from the bathroom and separate from it. It usually is in a small stall-like room with only the toilet in it. When entering the bathroom, one traditionally replaces their house slippers with plastic "toilet" slippers, swapping back when exiting the bathroom.</p>

<p>The modern Japanese kitchen features appliances such as a <a href="/wiki/Stove" title="Stove">stove</a>, a narrow fish grill (<a href="/wiki/Broiling" title="Broiling" class="mw-redirect">broiler</a>), and an electric <a href="/wiki/Refrigerator" title="Refrigerator">refrigerator</a>. The stovetop may be built-in or may be a self-contained unit on a counter-top, and it is usually gas-burning, although recently <a href="/wiki/Induction_cooker" title="Induction cooker">induction heating</a> (IH) stovetops have become popular. Common units of all types of stoves include two or three burners. Broilers designed for cooking fish are usually part of the stove and are located below, and unlike many Western-style grills, are not full width. Built-in ovens large enough to bake or roast are uncommon; in their place, work-top multifunction <a href="/wiki/Microwave_oven" title="Microwave oven">microwave ovens</a> are used. Many kitchens have electric exhaust fans. Furnishings commonly include microwave ovens, hot water boilers, and electric <a href="/wiki/Toaster_oven" title="Toaster oven" class="mw-redirect">toaster ovens</a>. Built-in <a href="/wiki/Dishwasher" title="Dishwasher">dishwashers</a> are rare, although some kitchens may have small dishwashers or dishdryers. The kitchen includes running water, typically with hot and cold faucets.</p>

<p>(see also <a href="/wiki/Sent%C5%8D" title="Sentō">Sentō</a>)</p>
<p>Japanese housing typically has multiple rooms for what in Western housing is the bathroom. Separate rooms for the <a href="/wiki/Japanese_toilet" title="Japanese toilet" class="mw-redirect">toilet</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sink" title="Sink">sink</a>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Ofuro" title="Ofuro" class="mw-redirect">ofuro</a></i> (bathing room) are common. Small apartments, however, frequently contain a tiny single bathroom called a <i>unit bath</i> that contains all three fixtures. The room with the sink, which is called a "clothes changing room", usually includes a space for a clothes-washing machine. The room containing the bathtub is waterproof with a space for washing, and often for showering, adjacent to (rather than in) the tub. As a result, bathwater is neither soapy nor dirty, and can be reused. Many washing machines in Japan come with an extension pipe to draw water from the tub for the wash.</p>
<p>Hot water usually comes from a gas or <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">kerosene</a> heater. The heater is usually located outdoors (at least in warm climates). Its gas supply may be from a municipal utility or from tanks on site. The typical Japanese water heater is <a href="/wiki/Water_heating#Tankless_heaters" title="Water heating">tankless</a> and heats water on demand. One heater may supply both bath and kitchen however many homes have two or more heaters.</p>

<p>Many homes include at least one traditional Japanese styled room, or <i><a href="/wiki/Washitsu" title="Washitsu">washitsu</a></i>. It features <i><a href="/wiki/Tatami" title="Tatami">tatami</a></i> flooring, <i><a href="/wiki/Shoji" title="Shoji" class="mw-redirect">shoji</a></i> rather than draperies covering the window, <i><a href="/wiki/Fusuma" title="Fusuma">fusuma</a></i> (opaque sliding vertical partitions) separating it from the other rooms, an <i>oshiire</i> (closet) with two levels (for storing <a href="/wiki/Futon" title="Futon">futon</a>), and a wooden ceiling. It might be unfurnished, and function as a family room during the day and a bedroom at night. Many <i>washitsu</i> have sliding glass doors opening onto a deck or balcony.</p>
<p>Other bedrooms, as well as living rooms, dining rooms, and kitchens, are in a Western style. They usually have modern synthetic floor coverings. Ceilings are typically also synthetic, and might be white or beige. Windows usually open by sliding laterally, although many kitchen windows open by tilting, with the bottom slanting outwards.</p>

<p>A one room mansion is a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Japanese_apartment&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Japanese apartment (page does not exist)">Japanese apartment</a> style in which there is only one small room (10&#160;m<sup>2</sup>/3.0 tsubo; 110&#160;sq&#160;ft in many cases) and usually a compact bathroom. These styles of units are most often rented by single individuals due to their extremely small size which make it hard for more than one person to reside in them. Most of Japan's city apartments have rooms such as these although family units (around 60 to 90&#160;m<sup>2</sup>/18 to 27 tsubo; 650 to 970&#160;sq&#160;ft in size) are more common, especially in Japan's suburbs.</p>

A modern kerosene space heater.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Space heating, rather than <a href="/wiki/Central_heating" title="Central heating">central heating</a>, is normal in Japanese homes. <a href="/wiki/Kerosene" title="Kerosene">Kerosene</a>, gas, and electric units are common. Dwellings are commonly sold and rented without heating or cooling equipment. Occupants purchase appliances and take them when they move.</p>
<p>The simplest kerosene burner has a tank for fuel, a mantle, and a control dial. Battery-operated electric ignition is a popular step up. The next rank has an electric fan to circulate hot air through the room. Many such units feature computer control of temperature. The computer can also turn them on and off on schedule. Gas heaters are also popular, and many homes have gas outlets in various rooms to accommodate portable units. Windows in many homes have vents to open to protect the occupants from excessive exhaust gas. Kerosene and gas units have safety features to turn off the fire and cut off the fuel supply when the heater receives a shake, whether from an accident or due to earthquake. These units also usually shut off automatically after two or three hours to prevent carbon monoxide fumes from building up while the resident is sleeping.</p>
<p>Another type of kerosene heater functions similar to a <a href="/wiki/Radiator" title="Radiator">radiator</a>, and consists of two parts. Kerosene fuel is stored in a tank and burned outside the home, and the flame is used to heat a fluid which is circulated into the second unit inside the house. In this unit, fans blow across the tubes carrying the heated fluid, and the room is warmed as a result. This type of heater is popular since it reduces the fumes significantly, and also virtually eliminates the chance of a small child or pet accidentally injuring themselves.</p>
<p>Electric heat is typically delivered through units mounted on the walls, such as above the doors to the deck or balcony, rather than through baseboards. These heaters often do double duty as air-conditioners. Thermostatic control and timers are available in most lines. The manufacturers of electric and electronic appliances produce these heaters.</p>
<p>In northern Japan, <i>yukadanbō</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji"><span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">床暖房</span></span> <span class="t_nihongo_help noprint"><sup><a href="/wiki/Help:Japanese" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color: #00e; font: bold 80% sans-serif; text-decoration: none; padding: 0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span> (literally, <i>floor heater</i>) is a type of radiating heater beneath the floor in some rooms of newer houses, where heated fluids are circulated to provide warmth. The cost is expensive, so sometimes this type of heater is only installed in small rooms like the "clothes changing room". Electric carpets have become popular in recent years.</p>
<p>Finally, a traditional type of heater known as a <i><a href="/wiki/Kotatsu" title="Kotatsu">kotatsu</a></i> is also still widely used today. The kotatsu can come in multiple forms, but the more common is as an electric heating element attached to the underside of a short table: the table is typically surrounded by a light duvet-like cloth to keep the heat in. This type of table is common in the <i>washitsu</i>.</p>

<p>Japanese dwellings connected to the nation's power grid have 100 V AC electricity at outlets throughout the home. The line frequency is 50 Hz in eastern Japan, and 60 Hz in the western part of the country. Service of 30 or 50 A is typical. Many domestic appliances operate properly at either frequency. Outlets resemble those formerly used in the United States (see <a href="/wiki/Domestic_AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#Type_A_.28American.2FJapanese_2-pin.29" title="Domestic AC power plugs and sockets" class="mw-redirect">comparison</a>), with two vertical slots. The slots are usually of equal width and many sockets lack earthing capability. Outlets in the kitchen, toilet, and bathroom, as well as those supplied by the ceiling for air-conditioning units do usually have earthing, either in the form of an extra round hole or a covered binding post. Devices designed for use with water, such as clothes washers and heated toilet seats, often have a separate earth wire or earth pin. Adapters are readily available to convert such plugs and so allow their use in all types of sockets.</p>
<p>Lighting equipment, like heaters, is normally the provenance of the occupant. Many homes do not include lights in the living, dining, and bedrooms. Instead, they have receptacles that provide both electrical connection and mechanical support for lighting equipment. There are four common types of ceiling connectors and these will generally also support the weight of the light fitting. Kitchens, bathrooms, corridors and genkan are likely to have built-in ceiling fixtures.</p>

<p>The "interphone", or intercom, is a common sight in Japanese homes. It provides telephone-like connection between the interior and exterior. The doorbell is frequently part of the interphone, and when it rings, the occupant can pick up a handset to talk with the visitor before opening the door. Models with video cameras are available, but a peephole in the door is sufficient for most homes.</p>
<p>In Japan the usual custom is for visitors to wait at the gate of the house before entering, and thus in houses the interphone speaker is placed at the gate of the house rather than directly before the front door. Nowadays there is very often an electrical lock on the gate which can be controlled from inside by the home owner, and camera equipped interphones are also common.</p>

<p>Outside of the downtown areas of large cities, many Japanese people park their cars at or near their homes. Some single-family houses have built-in garages; others have carports or unsheltered spaces on the grounds. Apartment and condominium buildings frequently have parking lots, some occupying (for example) the first floor of the building, others outdoors. Elevator parking allows double use of limited space: one car parks below ground level, with an elevator raising it when needed; the other parks at ground level. More elaborate elevator arrangements are also in use. Residents also lease parking spaces at vacant lots in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The usual maximum allowed height of a wooden building in Japan is two stories. Some wooden houses may have lofts, but these may not be used as bedrooms, only for storage space. Steel and concrete buildings may have more stories, but usually they only have two. Basements are uncommon in private homes but common in high-rise buildings.</p>
<p>The ratio of built-upon area is regulated according to a system called kenpeiritsu <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji"><span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">建ペイ率</span></span> <span class="t_nihongo_help noprint"><sup><a href="/wiki/Help:Japanese" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color: #00e; font: bold 80% sans-serif; text-decoration: none; padding: 0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span> involving the floor area of the house and the area of land the house is built upon. The area is restricted to being, for example, 80% of the area of the land. The <i>kenpeiritsu</i> varies according to the location of the land.</p>
<p>The taxable value of a house is controlled by its building material. Wooden houses are considered to have a lifespan of twenty years, and concrete ones to have a lifespan of thirty years, and the assessed price depreciates each year contrary to housing markets in other nations. Most real estate agents also use this pricing policy as a rough guide.</p>

<p>Many young Japanese adults choose to live with their parents, rather than seeking a separate residence, a phenomenon known as <a href="/wiki/Parasite_singles" title="Parasite singles" class="mw-redirect">parasite singles</a> (パラサイトシングル). A 1998 survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare indicated that about 60% of single Japanese men and 80% of single women between the ages of 20 and 34 lived with their parents.</p>
<p>After marriage, the young couple often live in the same house as their parents. A desire for some separation between the generations has led to the phenomenon of <i>nisedaijūtaku</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji"><span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">二世代住宅</span></span> <span class="t_nihongo_help noprint"><sup><a href="/wiki/Help:Japanese" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color: #00e; font: bold 80% sans-serif; text-decoration: none; padding: 0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>, literally "two generation housing", a single house which contains two complete separate living areas, one for the parents and one for the younger generation.</p>
<p>Conversely, in large metropolitan areas of Japan, it is no longer uncommon for young couples to co-habit in an apartment before they marry.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the elderly also continue to live with their children rather than being put into homes for the elderly. The responsibility for the parent usually falls onto the oldest male child or <i>atotsugi</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji"><span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">跡継ぎ</span></span> <span class="t_nihongo_help noprint"><sup><a href="/wiki/Help:Japanese" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color: #00e; font: bold 80% sans-serif; text-decoration: none; padding: 0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>. The number of elderly people living at home has led to a great demand for care products for home use, and also the so-called "barrier-free" housing, which contains fewer steps and obstacles for the elderly.</p>
<p>Apartment sharing between strangers is rare in Japan, most single people preferring to live in small sized individual apartments. However, in recent years, as Japan is undergoing demographic and socioeconomic change, it is becoming more common for young people to share apartments. Apartment designs are many and varied. An older pattern for single occupancy is a long thin, shoe-box shaped apartment, with a kitchen area and bathroom located often near the genkan and a living space/bedroom at the opposite end where a small balcony may be located.</p>
<p>Japanese companies and organizations often send their male employees to various locations throughout Japan. It is not always possible or desirable for the entire family unit to move near to the employees new job site. In this case, small apartments are rented by married men who then travel to the family home on the weekends.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Housing_in_Japan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: Home ownership">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Home ownership</span></h2>
<p>Because of the high cost of housing in major Japanese cities, many families and individuals <a href="/wiki/Renting" title="Renting">rent</a> <a href="/wiki/Apartment" title="Apartment">apartments</a> rather than owning their own home. In 2003, less than half of the living units in Tokyo were owned by the resident. On the other hand, rural areas tend to have much higher ownership rates. The highest rate in the country is <a href="/wiki/Toyama_Prefecture" title="Toyama Prefecture">Toyama Prefecture</a>, with around 80% of all living units being owned by the resident.</p>
<p>The living space of houses and <a href="/wiki/Condominium" title="Condominium">condominiums</a> (commonly referred to in Japan as <i>mansions</i>) is larger than apartments. The average size of an owned residence in Japan is 121.7&#160;m<sup>2</sup> (36.8 tsubo; 1,310&#160;sq&#160;ft). This varies wildly between major urban areas (Tokyo: 91.0&#160;m<sup>2</sup>/27.5 tsubo; 980&#160;sq&#160;ft) and rural areas (Toyama Prefecture: 178.4&#160;m<sup>2</sup>/54.0 tsubo; 1,920&#160;sq&#160;ft). The area of homes that are advertised for sale or rental is commonly listed in the Japanese unit <i>tsubo</i> (坪), which is approximately the area of two tatami mats (3.3&#160;m²/36&#160;sq&#160;ft). On diagrams of the house, individual room sizes are usually measured in tatami, as described above in the interior design section.</p>
<p>In recent years, condos/mansions have become more and more popular. Compared to 1983, when 64% of owned homes were single family dwellings, and only 27% were condos, more recent statistics show that the latter make up around 40% of the category now.</p>
<p>As houses age, owners replace them. A common pattern is to rebuild on the same site. To accomplish this, the occupants move to a temporary residence. A contractor demolishes the old structure and builds a new one on the grounds. The residents can then return to the location. Not having moved, they enjoy the convenience of keeping the same address, telephone number, and utility accounts, as well as avoid the cost of purchasing new land. Because of the wooden construction and relatively short lifespan of Japanese houses, this is often considered cheaper than maintaining the old structure.</p>

<p>To rent an apartment in Japan, would-be tenants visit real estate agents located in every neighborhood and browse through copies of apartments for rent. These usually have the layout of the apartment for rent and the costs to rent this apartment. If a would be tenant is interested in a particular apartment, the agent contacts the landlord to see if the apartment is still available and whether a visit could be arranged. Typically, a renter cannot rent an apartment on her or his own, but is required to have a guarantor who promises to pay the rent if problems arise.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Japanese <a href="/wiki/Landlord" title="Landlord">landlords</a> collect both a damage deposit and "<a href="/wiki/Key_money" title="Key money">key money</a>" before the renter takes occupancy, and the real estate agent is also paid a month's rent for services provided. Key money is a non-refundable payment to the landlord. In major cities like Tokyo and Osaka, key money is often a major investment in itself: up to six months' rent in many cases. In recent years many landlords have begun demanding smaller amounts of key money, equal to two or three months' rent or none at all. An industry of no-deposit apartments, called <i>monthly mansion</i> and <i>weekly mansion</i>, has also sprouted up in major cities: these generally charge higher rents than traditional leases, and may offer some hotel-style amenities such as linen service.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, a typical rental agreement is for one year. Each year, this agreement is re-negotiated, and the renter pays an additional month's rent as a fee. In many other cities, however, the one-year agreement is regarded simply as a minimum length of stay, and the rent does not change over the years.</p>

<p>Foreigners in Japan renting apartments on their own often face discrimination from real estate agents or landlords who refuse to rent to foreigners. Some agents will explain to foreigners directly that it is <i>difficult</i> to rent to them. Finding a guarantor is also difficult for many foreigners. Living in a Guest Houses is one way to circumvent these problems. Sometimes referred to as "Gaijin Houses" (meaning foreign persons' house), Guest Houses come in a variety of shapes and sizes. They are designed to provide short-term accommodation at reasonable prices with a minimum of hassle. Usually aimed at foreign visitors, they are becoming increasingly popular with young Japanese seeking to break with the tradition of living with parents until, and sometimes after, marriage. While deposits are payable in most cases they tend to be low and the famous Japanese <a href="/wiki/Key_money" title="Key money">key money</a> is not charged for these properties. A guest house will provide one room for sleeping, a shared kitchen and shared bathroom. Facilities like washing machines are usually coin operated but due to intense competition many landlords are seeking to provide as many free utilities as they can; free internet is almost a given in Tokyo these days. Typically, foreigners and Japanese are finding it harder to find guest houses and have been opting for small apartments called Aparto.</p>

<p>Many Japanese companies also maintain their own apartment buildings (called <i>shataku</i>) where young employees live when they first start working. Sometimes, the shataku is located near the company's office building. In other cases, the company may not own its own apartment complex, but hold an exclusive lease over one or more independent apartment buildings. In 2003, there were nearly 1.5 million shataku units in Japan.</p>

A traditional house in <a href="/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture" title="Okinawa Prefecture">Okinawa Prefecture</a> has the red tile roof characteristic of the region.</div>
</div>

<p>In premodern Japan, commoners typically lived either in free-standing houses, now known as <i><a href="/wiki/Minka" title="Minka">minka</a></i>, or, predominantly in cities, in <i><a href="/wiki/Machiya" title="Machiya">machiya</a></i> (町屋) or row-houses called <i>nagaya</i> (長屋). Examples are still visible in <a href="/wiki/Kyoto" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>. Additional dwelling patterns included the samurai residence, the homes of wealthy farmers (such as the village headmen), and the residences of <a href="/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> <a href="/wiki/Temple" title="Temple">temples</a>.</p>
<p>Wood was the material of choice for structures, while roofs could be thatch, cypress bark, tile, or bare wood. Raised floors were of wood, and might be covered with straw mats in places. Kitchens usually had dirt floors.</p>

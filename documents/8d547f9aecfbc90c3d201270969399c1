<p><b><a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">Copyright</a></b> was invented after the advent of the <a href="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing press</a> and subsequent widening of public literacy. As a legal concept, its origins in <a href="/wiki/Uk" title="Uk" class="mw-redirect">Britain</a> were from a reaction to printers' monopolies at the beginning of the eighteenth century. In Britain the <a href="/wiki/Union_of_the_Crowns" title="Union of the Crowns">King of England and Scotland</a> was concerned by the unregulated copying of books and used the <a href="/wiki/Royal_prerogative" title="Royal prerogative" class="mw-redirect">royal prerogative</a> to pass the <a href="/wiki/Licensing_of_the_Press_Act_1662" title="Licensing of the Press Act 1662">Licensing Act</a> of <a href="/wiki/1662" title="1662">1662</a> which established a register of licensed books and required a copy to be deposited with the <a href="/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Stationers_and_Newspaper_Makers" title="Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers">Stationers Company</a>, essentially continuing the licensing of material for the benefit of <a href="/wiki/Printer_(publisher)" title="Printer (publisher)">printers</a> that had long been in effect. The <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Anne" title="Statute of Anne">Statute of Anne</a> in <a href="/wiki/1709" title="1709">1709</a> was the first real copyright act, and gave the author in the new state of <a href="/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707" title="Acts of Union 1707">Britain</a> rights for a fixed period, after which the copyright expired. Internationally, the <a href="/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works" title="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works">Berne Convention</a> in <a href="/wiki/1887" title="1887">1887</a> set out the scope of copyright protection, and is still in force to this day. Copyright has grown from a legal concept regulating copying rights in the <a href="/wiki/Publishing" title="Publishing">publishing</a> of <a href="/wiki/Book" title="Book">books</a> and <a href="/wiki/Map" title="Map">maps</a> to one with a significant effect on nearly every modern <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industry</a>, covering such items as <a href="/wiki/Sound_recording" title="Sound recording" class="mw-redirect">sound recordings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Film" title="Film">films</a>, <a href="/wiki/Photography" title="Photography">photographs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Computer_software" title="Computer software">software</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Architecture" title="Architecture">architectural works</a>.</p>

<p>Authors, <a href="/wiki/Patron" title="Patron" class="mw-redirect">patrons</a>, and owners of works throughout the ages have tried to direct and control how copies of such works could be used once disseminated to others. <a href="/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Mozart</a>'s patron, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Baroness_von_Waldst%C3%A4tten&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Baroness von Waldstätten (page does not exist)">Baroness von Waldstätten</a>, allowed his compositions created for her to be performed, while <a href="/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel" title="George Frideric Handel">Handel</a>'s patron, <a href="/wiki/George_I_of_Great_Britain" title="George I of Great Britain">George I</a>, jealously guarded "<a href="/wiki/Water_Music_(Handel)" title="Water Music (Handel)">Water Music</a>."</p>
<p>Modern copyright has been influenced by an array of older legal rights that have been recognized throughout history, including the moral rights of the author who created a work, the economic rights of a benefactor who paid to have a copy made, the property rights of the individual owner of a copy, and a sovereign's right to censor and to regulate the printing industry. Prior to the invention of <a href="/wiki/Movable_type" title="Movable type">movable type</a> in the West in the mid-<a href="/wiki/Fifteenth_century" title="Fifteenth century" class="mw-redirect">fifteenth century</a>, texts were copied by hand and the small number of texts generated few occasions for these rights to be tested. Even during a period of a prospering book trade, during the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> when no copyright or similar regulations existed,<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> copying by those other than professional booksellers was rare. This is because books were, typically, copied by <a href="/wiki/Literate_slave" title="Literate slave" class="mw-redirect">literate slaves</a>, who were expensive to buy and maintain. Thus, any copier would have had to pay much the same expense as a professional publisher. Roman book sellers would sometimes pay a well regarded author for first access to a text for copying, but they had no exclusive rights to a work and authors were not normally paid anything for their work.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During the centuries following the destruction of the Roman Empire, European literary undertakings were confined almost entirely to the monasteries. The Roman usage, under which authors could dispose of their works to booksellers and the latter could be secure of some commercial control of the property purchased, was entirely forgotten. (In <a href="/wiki/Ken_Follet" title="Ken Follet" class="mw-redirect">Ken Follet</a>'s novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth" title="The Pillars of the Earth">The Pillars of the Earth</a>,</i> a character is astonished to meet a woman who actually owns books, which were normally owned only by churches and monasteries.)</p>
<p>Before legal and economic restrictions on print ownership came into being, one would occasionally find an author's or archivist's <a href="/wiki/Book_curse" title="Book curse">book curse</a> inscribed in a given volume. Beyond this, however, two major developments in the <a href="/wiki/14th_century" title="14th century">fourteenth</a> and <a href="/wiki/15th_century" title="15th century">fifteenth</a> centuries seem to have provoked the development of modern copyright. First, the expansion of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mercantile_trade&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mercantile trade (page does not exist)">mercantile trade</a> in major European cities and the appearance of the secular <a href="/wiki/University" title="University">university</a> helped produce an educated <a href="/wiki/Bourgeois" title="Bourgeois" class="mw-redirect">bourgeois</a> class interested in the information of the day. This helped spur the emergence of a <a href="/wiki/Public_sphere" title="Public sphere">public sphere</a>, which was increasingly served by entrepreneurial stationers who produced copies of books on demand. Second, <a href="/wiki/Johann_Gutenberg" title="Johann Gutenberg" class="mw-redirect">Gutenberg's</a> development of <a href="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">movable type</a> and the development and <a href="/wiki/Spread_of_the_printing_press" title="Spread of the printing press" class="mw-redirect">spread of the printing press</a> made mass reproduction of printed works quick and much cheaper than ever before. Before printing, the process of copying a work could be nearly as <a href="/wiki/Labor_intensive" title="Labor intensive" class="mw-redirect">labor intensive</a> and expensive as creating the original, and was largely relegated to monastic <a href="/wiki/Scribe" title="Scribe">scribes</a>. It appears that <a href="/wiki/Publishers" title="Publishers" class="mw-redirect">publishers</a>, rather than <a href="/wiki/Authors" title="Authors" class="mw-redirect">authors</a>, were the first to seek restrictions on the copying of printed works. Given that publishers of music and films in particular commonly now obtain the copyright from a creator (although rarely a book author) as a condition of mass reproduction of a work, one of the criticisms of the current system is that it benefits publishers more than it does creators. This is one of the chief arguments in favor of <a href="/wiki/Peer-to-peer" title="Peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> file sharing systems, making an analogy with the changes wrought by printing.</p>
<p>An interesting attempt at copyright in the early modern period was the notice attached to the <i>ha- Shirim asher li-Shelomo</i> , a setting of the <a href="/wiki/Psalms" title="Psalms">Psalms</a> by the composer <a href="/wiki/Salomone_Rossi" title="Salomone Rossi" class="mw-redirect">Salomone Rossi</a>, which happened to be the first music to be printed with a Hebrew type-face text (<a href="/wiki/1623" title="1623">1623</a>). It included a <a href="/wiki/Rabbi" title="Rabbi">rabbinical</a> curse on anyone who copied the contents.</p>
<p><a name="Movable_type" id="Movable_type"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=History_of_copyright_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Movable type">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Movable type</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing press</a> brought the possibility of compensation for literary labor. Very speedily, however, the unrestricted rivalry of printers brought into existence competing and unauthorized editions of various works, which diminished prospects of any payment, or even entailed loss, for the authors, editors, and printers of the original issue, and thus discouraged further undertaking. Any person with a press and some skills could use movable type to publish books and other items. <a href="/wiki/Scribe" title="Scribe">Scribes and scriveners</a> were no longer needed.</p>
<p>Prior to the printing press, stories remained in the oral tradition or underwent the continual fixing of the text in monasteries. The advent of standardised printing blocks meant that text was now presented in a fixed manuscript in specific ways that could be attributed to singular writers.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> This introduced the concept of a correct or authorised version of a text, so that any cheap reproductions were then considered to be the act of piracy. Divergences between copies of early printed books were common, as proofs were not fully corrected until the actual time of production. Therefore, printed text in the hands of pirates often resulted in incorrect texts being sold to the public.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Legislation regarding piracy at the time was often local and government officials were powerless to prevent infringement of the law. In the early days of the printing press, there was nothing to prevent other printers producing the same work if it was worthwhile.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> As it was more cost effective to reprint existing texts, cheaper editions of lower quality were produced for the market.

<p>Protection for the authors and their representatives was sought through <a href="/wiki/Privilege" title="Privilege">special privileges</a> obtained for separate works as issued. According to Elizabeth Armstrong (whom the Curators of the <a href="/wiki/Bodleian_Library" title="Bodleian Library">Bodleian Library</a> awarded the Gordon Duff Prize in 1965 for her essay on Printers' and authors' privileges in France and the Low Countries in the sixteenth century), "The <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Venice" title="Republic of Venice">republic of Venice</a> granted its first privilege for a particular book in <a href="/wiki/1486" title="1486">1486</a>.

<p>Most early <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> enactments in regard to literature were framed not so much with reference to the protection of authors as for the purpose of inducing printers (acting as publishers) to undertake certain literary enterprises which were believed to be important to the community. The Republic of Venice, the dukes of <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pope_Leo_X" title="Pope Leo X">Leo X</a> and other Popes conceded at different times to certain printers the exclusive privilege of printing for specific terms (rarely exceeding 14 years) editions of classic authors; not so much to secure profits for the printers, but rather to encourage, for the benefit of the community, literary ventures on the part of the editors and printers.</p>
<p>The first copyright privilege in <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> bears date <a href="/wiki/1518" title="1518">1518</a> and was issued to <a href="/wiki/Richard_Pynson" title="Richard Pynson">Richard Pynson</a>, King's Printer, the successor to <a href="/wiki/William_Caxton" title="William Caxton">William Caxton</a>. The privilege gives a monopoly for the term of two years. The date is 15 years later than that of the first privilege issued in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>. Early copyright privileges were called <a href="/wiki/Government-granted_monopoly" title="Government-granted monopoly">"monopolies</a>," particularly during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth</a>, who frequently gave grants of monopolies in articles of common use, such as salt, leather, coal, soap, cards, beer, and wine. The practice was continued until the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Monopolies_1623" title="Statute of Monopolies 1623">Statute of Monopolies</a> was enacted in <a href="/wiki/1623" title="1623">1623</a>, ending most monopolies, with certain exceptions, such as patents; after 1623, grants of <a href="/wiki/Letters_patent" title="Letters patent">Letters patent</a> to publishers became common.

<p>One of the earliest copyright disputes reputedly took place in 557 A.D. between <a href="/wiki/Finnian_of_Moville" title="Finnian of Moville">Abbot Finnian of Moville</a> and <a href="/wiki/St._Columba" title="St. Columba" class="mw-redirect">St. Columba</a> over St. Columba's copying of a <a href="/wiki/Psalter" title="Psalter">Psalter</a> belonging to an Abbot.

Only Guild members were allowed to practice the art of printing and the master and wardens of the society were empowered to search, seize, and burn all prohibited books, and to imprison any person found to be printing without a license. In return for their role in preventing the publication of books deemed heretical or seditious, the Guild's members enjoyed the economic benefits of a monopoly over the printing industry. From 1557 to 1641, the English Crown exercised authority over printing and the Stationers' Company through the <a href="/wiki/Star_Chamber" title="Star Chamber">Star Chamber</a>. After the abolition of the Star Chamber in 1641, the <a href="/wiki/English_Parliament" title="English Parliament" class="mw-redirect">English Parliament</a> continued to extend the Stationers' Company's censorship/monopoly arrangement through a series of ordinances and Licensing Acts between 1643 and 1692.</p>
<p>During its time, the Stationers' Company developed a private system for handling disputes between its members (sometimes referred to as a Stationer's Copyright). Under this system, specific Guild members held monopoly rights in a particular work that were treated as being perpetual. Although Guild members could purchase a manuscript from an author, authors could not become members of the Guild and were not entitled to any royalties or additional payments after purchase. Members were allowed to buy and sell rights over particular works to each other. As a method to keep track of which members claimed rights in what works, the Guild required that copyrights be recorded in a registration book at the Guild's Hall. The Licensing Act of 1662 also required printers to deposit a copy of each work with the Guild to prevent changes to the work after it was reviewed by censors. Many aspects of the Stationers' system were later incorporated into modern copyright laws.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a>, which was partly fought over the Crown's abuse of monopolies, the Stationers' power was threatened when the last Licensing Act expired in 1694. Without their monopolies, London's booksellers faced an unregulated influx of cheap texts printed outside Britain, and in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, that began flooding the English market. After years of lobbying Parliament by authors and members of the <a href="/wiki/Conger_(syndicate)" title="Conger (syndicate)">Conger</a>, the world's first modern copyright statute was enacted – the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Anne" title="Statute of Anne">Statute of Anne</a>, 8 Anne, ch. 19 (1710).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=History_of_copyright_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: The birth of modern copyright">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The birth of modern copyright</span></h3>
<p>England's <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Anne" title="Statute of Anne">Statute of Anne (1710)</a> is widely regarded as the first copyright law. The statute's full title was "An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned." This statute first accorded exclusive rights to authors (i.e., creators) rather than publishers, and it included protections for consumers of printed work ensuring that publishers could not control their use after sale. It also limited the duration of such exclusive rights to 28 years, after which all works would pass into the <a href="/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a>. Although the Statute of Anne created a system of monopoly rights similar in many ways to the Stationers' Company's private system, it introduced three major changes.</p>
<p>Unlike previous laws that gave broad monopoly power to the Stationers' Company, who would then administer a private system of copyright between Guild members, the Statute of Anne directly outlined a public copyright system that applied to the public in general. Second, the Statute recognized a copyright as originating in the author, rather than a Guild member. Lastly, it placed a time limitation on the monopoly enjoyed by holders of a copyright. Specifically, the Act provided that an owner of the copyright in any book already printed should have the exclusive right of publishing it for twenty-one years. For works not yet published, the act provided an exclusive right to publish for fourteen years from the time of first publication, with the stipulation that the right could be extended by an author for another 14 years. However, printers argued that the texts were property owned by the authors, and therefore could be sold as such to the printers, who would then own the rights.</p>
<p>There were territorial loopholes in the 1710 Act. It did not extend to all British territories, but only covered England, Scotland and Wales. Many reprints of British copyright works were consequently issued both in Ireland and in North American colonies, without any license from the copyright holder required. These works were frequently issued without payment to British copyright holders, so they were cheaper than London editions. They were popular with book-buyers, but were not <a href="/wiki/Copyright_infringements" title="Copyright infringements" class="mw-redirect">copyright infringements</a> in the formal sense of the word, being within the law. The term was used, however.</p>
<p>In Ireland and North America there were reprint publishers who sought out formal arrangements with and made payments to British copyright holders. This illicit reprint trade was also engaged in by some Scottish publishers. These publishers were sometimes prosecuted.</p>
<p>Irish reprints became a matter of great concern to London publishers. Their reprints undermined direct sales to Ireland. They also crossed the border into England, and were especially sold in English provincial markets which were becoming increasingly important to London publishers. Booksellers who sold these reprints in England, Scotland, and Wales were subject to prosecution.</p>
<p>Between 1710-1774 there was legal debate about what length of time was meant in the 1710 act.</p>
<p>In the 1730s, publishers in Scotland began to reprint titles that they no longer considered to be covered by copyright. Scottish publishers printed what they perceived to be public domain English works whose copyright had expired. They sold these titles in Scotland, and in the English provinces. English publishers objected to this, on the basis of what they saw as common-law rights and property (under the concept of common-law rights in the English system), which predated the Copyright Act. Under common-law rights, rights in published works were held to continue into perpetuity.</p>
<p>The case of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Donaldson_vs_Beckett&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Donaldson vs Beckett (page does not exist)">Donaldson vs Beckett</a>, in 1774, brought disagreements on the length of copyright to an end. The outcome of the case resulted in the decision that Parliament could, and had, put a limit on copyright length. This decision reflected a shift in English ideas of copyright. The English lords who made the decision in 1774 decided that it was not in the public's best interest to have London publishers control books in perpetuity, particularly as English publishers commonly kept prices high. There were some notions that this was a cultural or class issue. Works in perpetual copyright were seen to have limited access by some citizens to the cultural history of their own land.</p>
<p>Concepts of the roles of the author and publisher, of copyright law, and of general Enlightenment notions, interacted in this period. Authors had been previously seen to be divinely inspired. Patronage was a legitimate way to support authors, in part because of this. Authors who were paid, rather than entering into patron-relationships, were often regarded as hacks, and looked down upon. However, the notion of individual genius was becoming more common during the 1770s (the generation after Donaldson v Beckett), and being a paid author therefore became more accepted.</p>
<p>In Great Britain's North American colonies, reprinting British copyright works without permission had long happened episodically, but only became a major feature of colonial life after 1760. It became more commonplace to reprint British works in the colonies (mostly in the 13 American colonies). The impetus for this shift came from Irish and Scottish master printers and booksellers who had moved to the North American colonies in the mid 18th century. They were already familiar with the practice of reprinting and selling British copyright works, and continued the practice in North America, and it became a major part of the North American printing and publishing trade. <a href="/wiki/Robert_Bell" title="Robert Bell">Robert Bell</a> was an example. He was originally Scottish, and had spent almost a decade in Dublin before he moved to British North America in 1768. His operations, and those of many other colonial printers and booksellers, ensured that the practice of reprinting was well-established by the time of the American Declaration of Independence in 1776. Weakened American ties to Britain coincided with the increase of reprinting outside British copyright controls.</p>
<p>The Irish also made a flourishing business of shipping reprints to North America in the 18th century. Ireland's ability to reprint freely ended in 1801 when Ireland's Parliament merged with Great Britain, and the Irish became subject to British copyright laws.</p>
<p>The printing of uncopyrighted English works for the English-language market also occurred in other European countries. The British government responded to this problem in two ways: 1) it amended its own copyright statutes in 1842, explicitly forbidding import of any foreign reprint of British copyrighted work into the UK or its colonies, and 2) it began the process of reciprocal agreements with other countries. The first reciprocal agreement was with Prussia in 1846. The US remained outside this arrangement for some decades. Such authors as <a href="/wiki/Charles_Dickens" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mark_Twain" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a> objected to this.</p>

<p>As the first copyrights under the Statute began to expire, a legal battle erupted over what rights, if any, existed after a copyright term expired. The book publishers argued that a perpetual <a href="/wiki/Common_law" title="Common law">common law</a> copyright existed beyond the term outlined in the Statute, akin to the situation prior to passage of the Statute. The publishers argued that copyright was a <a href="/wiki/Natural_right" title="Natural right" class="mw-redirect">natural right</a>. The first major victory for the book publishers came in the case of <a href="/wiki/Millar_v._Taylor" title="Millar v. Taylor" class="mw-redirect">Millar v. Taylor</a>. The case involved the poet <a href="/wiki/James_Thomson_(poet)" title="James Thomson (poet)">James Thomson</a>'s book, "The Seasons." A bookseller, <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Millar" title="Andrew Millar">Andrew Millar</a>, purchased the publishing rights to "The Seasons" in 1729. After the copyright's term expired, Robert Taylor began publishing his own competing publication, which contained Thomson's poem. The judge assigned to the case sided with the publishers, finding that common law rights were not extinguished by the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Anne" title="Statute of Anne">Statute of Anne</a>. Under <a href="/wiki/William_Murray,_1st_Earl_of_Mansfield" title="William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield">Mansfield</a>'s ruling, the publishers had a perpetual common-law right to publish a work for which they had acquired the rights.</p>
<p>The decision in <i>Millar</i>, however, was made by an English court and so did not extend to Scotland, where a reprint industry continued to thrive and a Scottish court rejected the notion of a perpetual common-law copyright in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Hinton_v._Donaldson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hinton v. Donaldson (page does not exist)">Hinton v. Donaldson</a>. The debate culminated in the landmark case of <a href="/wiki/Donaldson_v._Beckett" title="Donaldson v. Beckett" class="mw-redirect">Donaldson v. Beckett</a>. The decision by the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> in February of <a href="/wiki/1774" title="1774">1774</a> rejected common-law copyright. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Pratt,_1st_Earl_Camden" title="Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden">Lord Camden</a>, attacked the publisher's foundation for a common-law right:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The arguments attempted to be maintained on the side of the respondents, were founded on patents, privileges, Star Chamber decrees, and the bye laws of the Stationers' Company; all of them the effects of the grossest tyranny and usurpation; the very last places in which I should have dreamt of finding the least trace of the common law of this kingdom; and yet, by a variety of subtle reasoning and metaphysical refinements, have they endeavored to squeeze out the spirit of the common law from premises in which it could not possibly have existence.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Although the decision in <i>Donaldson</i> firmly established that, in England, works to which a copyright has expired fall to the <a href="/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a>, the debate itself has resurfaced in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and elsewhere in the years since.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works" title="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works">Berne Convention</a> of 1886 first established the recognition of a common copyright amongst several sovereign nations. (International recognition of copyright was also provided by the <a href="/wiki/Universal_Copyright_Convention" title="Universal Copyright Convention">Universal Copyright Convention</a> of 1952, but that convention is today largely of only historical interest.) Contrary to English tradition, copyright is granted automatically to creative works under the Berne Convention; an author does not have to actively register or otherwise apply for copyright to be applied to the work. As soon as the work is "fixed", that is, written or recorded on some physical medium (e.g. words written on page, music recorded onto tape, etc.), its author is automatically granted exclusive rights to the distribution of the work and any derivative works unless and until the author explicitly disclaims them, or until the copyright expires.</p>

<p>Historically, many societies governed by <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a> governments have viewed copyright as a welfare or support mechanism for artists, instead of (or in addition to) a legal right.

<p>The history of <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> has several key themes: responses to innovations in media technologies, expansions in the definition, scope and operation of copyright, and international dissemination of the evolutions occurring in particular states.</p>

<p>The genesis of copyright can be seen as a process through which capitalist societies found a way to wed the printing press and the marketplace (see also <a href="/wiki/Print_culture" title="Print culture">print culture</a>).</p>
<p>This commercial regulatory system, designed for the printing press, was successively expanded to include photography, phonography, film, broadcasting, photocopying (<a href="/wiki/Reprography" title="Reprography">reprography</a>) and computer programs as those technologies became widespread. These expansions were at first controversial but over time became stable components of commerce in the relevant industries.</p>
<p>The placement of present disputes over copyright in this historical trajectory is an interesting problem. Some commentators would add the Internet and digitised works in general to the end of the above list of technological expansions. In that view, the same functions of copyright (especially creating marketplace incentives for the production of works) remain necessary or desirable for digital material and will therefore eventually become stable and consensual. In contrast, commentators such as Barlow (1994) have argued that digital copyright is fundamentally different and will remain persistently difficult to enforce; others such as <a href="/wiki/Richard_Stallman" title="Richard Stallman">Stallman</a> (1996) have argued that the Internet deeply undermines the economic rationale for copyright in the first place. These perspectives may lead to the consideration of <a href="/wiki/Alternative_compensation_system" title="Alternative compensation system">alternative compensation systems</a> in place of exclusive rights.</p>

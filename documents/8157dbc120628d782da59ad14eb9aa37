<p>The term <b>Technicolor</b> historically has been used to describe four separate concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Technicolor process/format</b>: the several image origination systems used in film production, which culminated in the "three-strip" process. (1922–1954)</li>
<li><b>Technicolor dye <a href="/wiki/Imbibition" title="Imbibition">imbibition</a> printing</b> (AKA "dye transfer"): a stable photolithographic system used for the creation of color prints, originally conceived for the Technicolor format but also compatible with standard monopack film. (1928–2002, with differing gaps of availability post-1974 depending on lab)</li>
<li><b>Technicolor labs</b>: a collection of <a href="/wiki/Film_laboratory" title="Film laboratory">film laboratories</a> across the world owned and run by Technicolor for post-production services including developing, printing, and transferring films in all major developing processes, as well as Technicolor's proprietary ones. Films using these labs thus retain a "Color by Technicolor" credit even though no Technicolor <i>format</i> or <i>printing</i> have been offered recently. (1922–present)</li>
<li><b>Technicolor</b>: an umbrella company encompassing all the above as well as other ancillary services. (1914–present)</li>

<p>Technicolor originally existed in a <a href="/wiki/RG_color_space" title="RG color space">two-color (red and green) system</a>. In <b>Process 1 (<a href="/wiki/1916_in_film" title="1916 in film">1916</a>)</b>, a prism beam-splitter behind the camera lens exposed two adjacent frames of a single strip of black and white negative film simultaneously, one behind a red filter, the other behind a green filter. Because two frames were being exposed at the same time, the film had to be photographed and projected at twice the normal speed. Exhibition required a special projector with two <a href="/wiki/Apertures" title="Apertures" class="mw-redirect">apertures</a> (one with a red filter and the other with a green filter), two lenses, and an adjustable prism that aligned the two images on the screen. Technicolor itself produced the only movie made in Process 1, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Gulf_Between_(1917_film)" title="The Gulf Between (1917 film)">The Gulf Between</a></i>, which had a limited tour of Eastern cities in the USA, primarily to interest motion picture producers and exhibitors in color. The near-constant need for a technician to adjust the projection alignment doomed this <a href="/wiki/Additive_color" title="Additive color">additive color</a> process. Only a few frames of <i>The Gulf Between</i>, showing star <a href="/wiki/Grace_Darmond" title="Grace Darmond">Grace Darmond</a>, are known to exist today.</p>

<p>Technicolor became a subtractive color process with <b>Process 2 (<a href="/wiki/1922_in_film" title="1922 in film">1922</a>)</b> (cited by academics originally as "two-strip" Technicolor, although the term is erroneously used for Technicolor's first three formats). As before, the special Technicolor camera used a prism beam-splitter to expose simultaneously two adjacent frames of a single strip of black and white film, one behind a green filter and one behind a red filter. The difference came in the creation of the print. The frames exposed behind the green filter were printed on one strip of black and white film, and the frames exposed behind the red filter were printed on another strip. The "green" positive was then <a href="/wiki/Film_tinting" title="Film tinting">toned</a> red and the "red" positive was toned green, thereby coloring each positive with their complementaries to the negative. The two strips, made of film stocks thinner than regular film, were then cemented together base to base to create a projection print. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Toll_of_the_Sea_(1922_film)" title="The Toll of the Sea (1922 film)" class="mw-redirect">The Toll of the Sea</a></i> debuted on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1922-11-26"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="11-26"><a href="/wiki/November_26" title="November 26">November 26</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1922" title="1922">1922</a></span> as the first general release film to use Technicolor.</p>

<p>The second all-color feature in this process, <i><a href="/wiki/Wanderer_of_the_Wasteland_(film)" title="Wanderer of the Wasteland (film)">Wanderer of the Wasteland</a></i>, was released in 1924. Process 2 was also used for color sequences in such major motion pictures as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Ten_Commandments_(1923_film)" title="The Ten Commandments (1923 film)">The Ten Commandments</a></i> (1923), <i><a href="/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1925_film)" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)">The Phantom of the Opera</a></i> (1925), and <i><a href="/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1925_film)" title="Ben-Hur (1925 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i> (1925). <a href="/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks" title="Douglas Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/The_Black_Pirate" title="The Black Pirate">The Black Pirate</a></i> (1926), became the fourth feature to be filmed entirely in Technicolor. The first sound Technicolor feature (with a synchronized sound track and sound effects) was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Cavalier_(film)" title="The Cavalier (film)">The Cavalier</a></i> (1928), which was also the last feature to be photographed in Process 2.</p>
<p>Although successful commercially, Process 2 had technical problems of its own: the film images on the two cemented matrices did not share the same plane, sometimes creating a soft focus, depending on the <a href="/wiki/Depth_of_field" title="Depth of field">depth of field</a> of the projector's optics. More destructively, the uneven thickness of the film would cause it to cup irregularly, taking it further out of focus and damaging the film. The presence of the image on both sides of the print could lead to twice the amount of scratches being visible onscreen with normal wear. Prints would buckle as the strip of celluloid nearest the light would contract from the heat, and a great amount of light was needed to project an early Technicolor film.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Splicing became difficult as both emulsions had to be scraped before applying cement, and the irregular thickness of the base could cause splices that were either too heavy or too weak, breaking the film as it went through the projector. Technicolor had to print up replacement reels that were constantly being shipped between its <a href="/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts" title="Boston, Massachusetts" class="mw-redirect">Boston, Massachusetts</a> plant and exhibitors, with the buckled prints being ironed out by Technicolor employees before being shipped back on the exhibition circuit.</p>
<p><a name="Process_3" id="Process_3"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Technicolor&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Process 3">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Process 3</span></h4>
<p>Based on the <a href="/wiki/Handschiegl_Color_Process" title="Handschiegl Color Process" class="mw-redirect">Handschiegl Color Process</a> created in 1916 by Max Handschiegl, <b>Technicolor Process 3 (<a href="/wiki/1928_in_film" title="1928 in film">1928</a>)</b> was developed to eliminate the projection print made of double-cemented prints, in favor of a print created by a process similar to <a href="/wiki/Lithography" title="Lithography">lithography</a> called <i>dye-imbibition</i>. The Technicolor camera for Process 3 was identical to that for Process 2, simultaneously photographing two adjacent frames of black and white film behind red and green filters.</p>
<p>In the lab, every other frame of the camera negative was printed onto one strip of specially prepared gelatin film (or "matrix") to create a red record, and the remaining frames were printed onto a second strip of blank film to create a green record. The gelatin on the matrix stock was hardened by a developer in relation to the amount of light that struck it from the negative. The softer gelatin was then washed off the matrix, leaving a relief image created by the hardened gelatin. The matrices were soaked in dye baths of complementary colors — the strip containing the red record was dyed green, and the strip containing the green record was dyed red — in which the gelatin would absorb the dye. The thicker the gelatin, the more dye it absorbed.</p>
<p>During printing, the matrices were then placed in contact with a blank, emulsified strip of film (known as the "blank") and the dye was transferred from the matrices to the new print. A <a href="/wiki/Mordant" title="Mordant">mordant</a> made from deacetylated <a href="/wiki/Chitin" title="Chitin">Chitin</a> was applied to the blank before printing, which kept the dye from migrating.</p>
<p>As this dye-transfer process was introduced around the same time as <a href="/wiki/Sound-on-film" title="Sound-on-film">sound-on-film</a>, the emulsion on the blank was adapted to a black and white stock where the soundtrack and frame line was printed in black and white first, and then the dye-layer applied.</p>

In addition, scores of features were released with Technicolor sequences. Numerous short subjects were also photographed in Technicolor Process 3, including the first color sound cartoons by producers such as <a href="/wiki/Ub_Iwerks" title="Ub Iwerks">Ub Iwerks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Walter_Lantz" title="Walter Lantz">Walter Lantz</a>. <i><a href="/wiki/Song_of_the_Flame" title="Song of the Flame" class="mw-redirect">Song of the Flame</a></i> became the first color movie to use a <a href="/wiki/Widescreen" title="Widescreen">widescreen</a> process (using a system known as <a href="/wiki/Vitascope" title="Vitascope">Vitascope</a>, which used 65mm film).</p>
<p>In 1931, an improvement of Technicolor Process 3 was developed which removed grain from the Technicolor film and resulted in a more vivid and vibrant color.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> This process was first used on a <a href="/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">Radio Picture</a> entitled: <i><a href="/wiki/The_Runaround_(1931_film)" title="The Runaround (1931 film)">The Runaround</a></i> (1931). The new process not only improved the color but also removed specks (that looked like bugs) from the screen, which had previously blurred outlines and lowered visibility. This new improvement along with a reduction in cost (from 8.85 cents to 7 cents per foot) led to a new color revival.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers" class="mw-redirect">Warner Brothers</a> led the way once again by producing three features (out of an announced plan for six features) in the new process: <i><a href="/wiki/Manhattan_Parade_(film)" title="Manhattan Parade (film)">Manhattan Parade</a></i> (1932), <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_X_(film)" title="Doctor X (film)">Doctor X</a></i> (1932) and <i><a href="/wiki/Mystery_of_the_Wax_Museum_(film)" title="Mystery of the Wax Museum (film)" class="mw-redirect">Mystery of the Wax Museum</a></i> (1933).

Two independently produced features were also produced in this improved Technicolor process: <i><a href="/wiki/Legong:_Dance_of_the_Virgins_(film)" title="Legong: Dance of the Virgins (film)" class="mw-redirect">Legong: Dance of the Virgins</a></i> (1934) and <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Kliou_the_Tiger_(film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kliou the Tiger (film) (page does not exist)">Kliou the Tiger</a></i> (1935).</p>
<p>Very few of the original camera negatives of movies made in Technicolor Process 2 or 3 survive. In the late 1940s, most were discarded from storage at Technicolor in a space-clearing move, after the studios declined to reclaim the materials. Those that survived into the 1950s were often used to make black and white prints for television and simply discarded thereafter. This explains why so many early color films exist today solely in black and white.</p>
<p>Warner Bros., which had vaulted from an extremely minor exhibitor to a major studio by its introduction of the <a href="/wiki/Talkie" title="Talkie" class="mw-redirect">talkies</a>, latched onto Technicolor as the next big thing. Other producers followed Warners Bros.' example by making features in color, with either Technicolor or one of its competitors, such as Brewster Color and <a href="/wiki/Multicolor" title="Multicolor">Multicolor</a> (later <a href="/wiki/Cinecolor" title="Cinecolor">Cinecolor</a>). However, the aspect of color did not increase the number of audiences to the point where it was economical. This, and <a href="/wiki/The_Great_Depression" title="The Great Depression" class="mw-redirect">the Great Depression</a> severely strained movie studios' finances, and spelled the end of the first Technicolor boom.</p>

<p>As early as 1924, Technicolor envisioned a full-color process, and by 1929, the company was actively developing such a process. Hollywood made so much use of Technicolor in 1929 and 1930, that many believed that Hollywood would soon be turning out color films exclusively. By 1931, the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> took its toll on the movie industry, and they began to cut back on expenses. The production of color films had decreased dramatically by 1932, when Technicolor unveiled its first three-color process in an attempt to entice the movie studios. Light passed through the lens and was then divided 50-50 by a beam splitting prism block. The green aspect of the scene was recorded through a filter on an orthochromatically sensitized film strip, while the light behind a magenta filter was further broken down by a <a href="/wiki/Bipack" title="Bipack">bipack</a> of a film strip panchromatically sensitized for red and a non-sensitized for blue light. The blue record film bore a red gelatin filter layer. This process accurately reproduced the full color spectrum and optically printed using a <a href="/wiki/Dye-transfer_process" title="Dye-transfer process">dye-transfer process</a> in cyan, magenta and yellow.</p>
<p>Kalmus convinced <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> to shoot one of his <i><a href="/wiki/Silly_Symphony" title="Silly Symphony" class="mw-redirect">Silly Symphony</a></i> cartoons <i><a href="/wiki/Flowers_and_Trees" title="Flowers and Trees">Flowers and Trees</a></i> (1932) in <b>Process 4</b>, the new "three-strip" process. Seeing the potential in full-color Technicolor, <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> negotiated an exclusive contract for the use of the process, going to September 1935 (at that time, other studios could start producing cartoons in the process, but were barred from releasing them until 1936).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Competitors such as the <a href="/wiki/Fleischer_Studios" title="Fleischer Studios">Fleischer Studios</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Ub_Iwerks" title="Ub Iwerks">Ub Iwerks</a> studio were shut out — they had to settle for either the two-color Technicolor systems or use a competing process such as <a href="/wiki/Cinecolor" title="Cinecolor">Cinecolor</a>.</p>
<p><i>Flowers and Trees</i> was a success with audiences and critics alike, and won the first <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Animated_Short_Film" title="Academy Award for Animated Short Film" class="mw-redirect">Academy Award for Animated Short Film</a>. The next <i>Silly Symphonies</i> to be shot with the process, <i><a href="/wiki/Three_Little_Pigs_(film)" title="Three Little Pigs (film)">Three Little Pigs</a></i>, engendered such a positive audience response that it overshadowed the feature films with which it was shown. <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood" class="mw-redirect">Hollywood</a> was buzzing about color film again. According to <i><a href="/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)" title="Fortune (magazine)">Fortune</a></i> magazine, "<a href="/wiki/Merian_C._Cooper" title="Merian C. Cooper">Merian C.

<p>Although Disney's earliest Technicolor cartoons utilized the general three-strip camera, an improved process was adopted in 1934 solely for cartoon work: the camera would contain one strip of black and white negative film, and each animation cel would be photographed three times, on three sequential frames, behind alternating red, green, and blue filters. Three separate dye transfer printing matrices would be created from the red, green, and blue records in their respective additive colors, cyan, magenta and yellow.</p>

<p>Technicolor's advantage over most early, natural color processes was that it was a <a href="/wiki/Subtractive_color" title="Subtractive color">subtractive synthesis</a> rather than an <a href="/wiki/Additive_color" title="Additive color">additive</a> one. Technicolor prints could run on any projector; unlike other additive processes, it could represent colors clearly without any special projection equipment or techniques. More importantly, Technicolor held the best balance between a quality image and speed of printing, compared to other subtractive systems of the time.</p>
<p>The Technicolor Process 4 used colored filters, a <a href="/wiki/Beam_splitter" title="Beam splitter">beam splitter</a> made from a thinly coated mirror inside a split-cube <a href="/wiki/Prism_(optics)" title="Prism (optics)">prism</a>, and three strips of black-and-white film (hence the "three-strip" designation). The beam splitter allowed ⅓ of the light to shine straight through into a green filter and onto a strip of <a href="/wiki/Panchromatic" title="Panchromatic" class="mw-redirect">panchromatic</a> black-and-white film, which registered the green part of the image. The other ⅔ of the light, reflected sideways by the mirror, went through a magenta filter to remove green light, exposed a layer of blue-sensitive <a href="/wiki/Orthochromatic" title="Orthochromatic">orthochromatic</a> film and then onto a red-sensitive strip of <a href="/wiki/Panchromatic" title="Panchromatic" class="mw-redirect">panchromatic</a> stock. The "blue" and "red" films were layered into a "bipack". The "green" film was a separate strip.</p>
<p>To print the film, each colored strip had a print struck from it onto a light sensitive piece of gelatin film. When processed, "dark" portions of the film hardened, and light areas were washed away. The gelatin film strip was then soaked with a dye complementary to the color recorded by the film: cyan for red, magenta for green, and yellow for blue (see also: <a href="/wiki/CMYK_color_model" title="CMYK color model">CMYK color model</a> for a technical discussion of color printing).</p>
<p>A single clear strip of black and white film with the soundtrack pre-printed was first treated with a <a href="/wiki/Mordant" title="Mordant">mordant</a> solution and then brought in contact with each of the three dye-soaked colored strips in turn, building up the complete color image. This process is referred to as "dye imbibition", a technique which was commonly used in conventional <a href="/wiki/Offset_printing" title="Offset printing">offset printing</a> or <a href="/wiki/Lithography" title="Lithography">lithography</a> but which the Technicolor process utilized on film. The final strip of film would have the dyes soaked into its emulsion and not simply printed onto its surface. The end result was a bright and clear representation of natural color.</p>
<p>Early in the process, the clear film would be pre-exposed with a 50 percent density black-and-white positive image derived from the green matrix. This process was used largely to cover up fringing in the early days of three-strip printing, and to print <a href="/wiki/Frame_line" title="Frame line">frame lines</a> that would otherwise be white. Because the layer was of neutral density, the contrast blacks in the picture was increased, but colors were muted to an extent. By the early 1940s, however, Technicolor streamlined the process to make up for these shortcomings and this practice ceased. However, a black-and-white silver image was still used for the frame line and sound track.</p>

<p>The studios were willing to adopt three-color Technicolor for live-action feature production, if it could be proved viable. Shooting three-strip Technicolor required very bright lighting, as the film had an extremely slow <a href="/wiki/Film_speed" title="Film speed">speed</a> of ASA 5. That, and the bulk of the cameras and a lack of experience with three-color <a href="/wiki/Cinematography" title="Cinematography">cinematography</a> made for skepticism in the studio board rooms.</p>
<p><i>Fortune</i> magazine's October 1934 article stressed that Technicolor, as a corporation, was rather remarkable in that it kept its investors quite happy despite the fact that it had only been in profit twice in all of the years of its existence, during the early boom at the turn of the decade. A well-managed company, half of whose stock was controlled by a clique loyal to Kalmus, Technicolor never had to cede any control to its bankers or unfriendly stockholders. In the mid-'30s, all the major studios except MGM were in the financial doldrums, and a color process that truly reproduced the visual spectrum was seen as a possible shot-in-the-arm for the ailing industry.</p>
<p>In November 1933, Technicolor's Herbert Kalmus and <a href="/wiki/RKO" title="RKO" class="mw-redirect">RKO</a> announced plans to produce three-strip Technicolor films in 1934, beginning with <a href="/wiki/Ann_Harding" title="Ann Harding">Ann Harding</a> starring in a projected film <i>The World Outside</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Live-action use of three-strip Technicolor was first seen in a musical number of the <a href="/wiki/MGM" title="MGM" class="mw-redirect">MGM</a> feature <i><a href="/wiki/The_Cat_and_the_Fiddle" title="The Cat and the Fiddle">The Cat and the Fiddle</a></i>, released February 16, 1934. On July 28 of that year, <a href="/wiki/Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers" class="mw-redirect">Warner Brothers</a> released <i>Service With a Smile</i>, followed by <i>Good Morning, Eve!</i> on August 5, both being comedy <a href="/wiki/Short_film" title="Short film" class="mw-redirect">short films</a> starring <a href="/wiki/Leon_Errol" title="Leon Errol">Leon Errol</a> and filmed in three-strip Technicolor. Pioneer Pictures, a movie company formed by Technicolor investors, produced the film usually credited as the first live-action short film shot in the three-strip process, <i><a href="/wiki/La_Cucaracha_(1934_film)" title="La Cucaracha (1934 film)">La Cucaracha</a></i> released August 31, 1934. <i>La Cucaracha</i> is a two-reel musical comedy that cost $65,000, approximately four times what an equivalent black-and-white two-reeler would cost. Released by <a href="/wiki/RKO" title="RKO" class="mw-redirect">RKO</a>, the short was a success in introducing the new Technicolor as a viable medium for live-action films. The three-strip process also was used in some short sequences filmed for several movies made during 1934, including the final sequences of <i><a href="/wiki/The_House_of_Rothschild" title="The House of Rothschild">The House of Rothschild</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Pictures" title="20th Century Pictures" class="mw-redirect">20th Century Pictures</a>/<a href="/wiki/United_Artists" title="United Artists">United Artists</a>) with <a href="/wiki/George_Arliss" title="George Arliss">George Arliss</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Kid_Millions" title="Kid Millions">Kid Millions</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn Studios</a>) with <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Cantor" title="Eddie Cantor">Eddie Cantor</a>.</p>

Initially, three-strip Technicolor was only used indoors.

<p>One major drawback of Technicolor's 3-strip process was that it required a special, bulky, and very heavy Technicolor camera. Film studios could not purchase Technicolor cameras, only rent them for their productions, complete with camera technicians and a "color supervisor" to ensure sets, costumes and makeup didn't push beyond the limitations of the system. Often on many early productions, the supervisor was <a href="/wiki/Natalie_Kalmus" title="Natalie Kalmus">Natalie Kalmus</a>, ex-wife of Herbert Kalmus and part owner of the company.</p>
<p>The process of splitting the image reduced the amount of light reaching the film stock. Since the <a href="/wiki/Film_speed" title="Film speed">film speed</a> of the stocks used were fairly slow, early Technicolor productions required a greater amount of lighting than a black and white production. It is reported that temperatures on the film set of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i> frequently exceeded 100 °F (38 °C), and some of the more heavily costumed characters required a large water intake. Some actors and actresses claimed to have suffered permanent eye damage from the high levels of illumination.</p>
<p>Because of the added lighting and triple amount of film necessary, Technicolor's productions demanded a high budget film for its usage.</p>

<p>Eastman Kodak introduced its first 35 mm color negative film in 1949, and then in 1952 an improved version suitable for Hollywood production.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> This allowed Technicolor prints to be struck from a single camera negative exposed in a standard camera. <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Foxfire_(1955_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Foxfire (1955 film) (page does not exist)">Foxfire</a></i> (1955), filmed in 1954 by <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal</a>, starring <a href="/wiki/Jane_Russell" title="Jane Russell">Jane Russell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Chandler_(actor)" title="Jeff Chandler (actor)">Jeff Chandler</a>, was the last American-made feature photographed with a Technicolor three-strip camera.</p>
<p>In 1952, Eastman Kodak introduced a high-quality color print film, allowing studios to produce prints through standard photographic processes as opposed to having to send them to Technicolor for the expensive dye imbibition process. That same year, the Technicolor lab adapted its dye transfer process to derive matrices and imbibition prints directly from Eastmancolor negatives. In the case of post-1953 Technicolor movies, the dye transfer release prints never faded, whereas the color negatives from which they were derived, the cyan record faded in as little as five years.</p>
<p>Technicolor unveiled their <a href="/wiki/Stereoscopic" title="Stereoscopic" class="mw-redirect">stereoscopic</a> camera for <a href="/wiki/3-D_films" title="3-D films" class="mw-redirect">3-D films</a> in March of 1953. The rig utilized two three-strip cameras, running a total of six strips of film at once (three for the left eye and three for the right)<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>. Only two films were shot with this camera set-up: <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Flight_to_Tangier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Flight to Tangier (page does not exist)">Flight to Tangier</a></i> and <i>Money From Home</i>. A similar, but different system had been used by a different company, utilizing two three-strip cameras side-by-side for a British short called <i>Royal River</i>.</p>
<p>In 1954, Technicolor made reduction dye transfer prints of the large format <a href="/wiki/VistaVision" title="VistaVision">VistaVision</a> negative. Their process was also adapted for use with <a href="/wiki/Todd-AO" title="Todd-AO">Todd-AO</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ultra_Panavision_70" title="Ultra Panavision 70">Ultra Panavision 70</a> and <a href="/wiki/Technirama" title="Technirama">Technirama</a> formats. All of them were an improvement over the three-strip negatives since the negative print-downs generated sharper and finer grain dye transfer copies.</p>
<p>Technicolor eventually fell out of favor in the United States as being too expensive and too slow in turning out prints. While audience numbers were decreasing, the number of movie screens in the US was increasing. And while dye-transfer printing yielded superior color printing, the number of high speed prints that could be struck in labs all over the country outweighed the fewer, slower number of prints that could only be had in Technicolor's labs. The last new American film released before Technicolor closed their dye plant was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Godfather,_Part_II" title="The Godfather, Part II" class="mw-redirect">The Godfather, Part II</a></i> (1974).</p>
<p>In 1975, the US dye transfer plant was closed and Technicolor became an Eastman-only processor. In 1977, the final dye-transfer printer left in Rome was used by <a href="/wiki/Dario_Argento" title="Dario Argento">Dario Argento</a> to make prints for his horror film <i><a href="/wiki/Suspiria" title="Suspiria">Suspiria</a></i>. In 1980, the Italian Technicolor plant ceased printing dye transfer. The British line was shut down in 1978 and sold to Beijing Film and Video Lab in China. A great many films from China and Hong Kong were made in the Technicolor dye transfer process, including <a href="/wiki/Zhang_Yimou" title="Zhang Yimou">Zhang Yimou's</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Ju_Dou" title="Ju Dou">Ju Dou</a></i> and even one American film, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Space_Avenger&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Space Avenger (page does not exist)">Space Avenger</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/1989_in_movies" title="1989 in movies" class="mw-redirect">1989</a>, director: Richard W. Haines). The Beijing line was shut down in 1993 for a number of reasons, including inferior processing.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Technicolor&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Dye transfer Technicolor in archival work">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dye transfer Technicolor in archival work</span></h3>
<p>By the late 1990s the dye transfer process still had its advantages in the film archival community. Because the dye transfer process used stable <a href="/wiki/Acid_dye" title="Acid dye">acid dyes</a>, Technicolor prints are considered of archival quality. A Technicolor print from the dye transfer era will retain its original colors virtually unchanged for decades with proper storage, whereas prints printed on Eastman color stocks produced prior to 1983 may suffer color fading after exposure to ultraviolet light and hot, humid conditions as a result of less stable photochemical dyes. Fading on some prints is so rapid that in many cases, after as little as five to ten years, only the magenta record is perceivable on the film.</p>
<p>Furthermore, three-strip camera negatives are all on silver-based black and white stock, which have stayed unaltered over the course of time with proper handling. This has become of importance in recent years with the large market for films transferred to video formats for home viewing. The best color quality control for video transfer by far is achieved by optically printing from Technicolor negatives, or by recombining the negative through digital means and printing, onto low-contrast stock.</p>
<p>In 1997, Technicolor reintroduced the dye transfer process to general film production. It was also used on the restorations of films such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Rear_Window" title="Rear Window">Rear Window</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Funny_Girl_(film)" title="Funny Girl (film)">Funny Girl</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Apocalypse_Now" title="Apocalypse Now">Apocalypse Now Redux</a></i>. An article on the restoration of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></i> claimed that a rare dye-transfer print of the movie, made for director <a href="/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> at the British Technicolor lab during its initial run, had been used as a color reference for the restoration. The article claimed that conventional color prints of the movie had all degraded over the years to the extent that no two had the same color balance. However, because of the variation in color balance per print, dye-transfer prints are used in the professional restoration world as only a rough guideline.</p>
<p><a name="Reintroduction_of_the_dye_transfer_process" id="Reintroduction_of_the_dye_transfer_process"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Technicolor&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Edit section: Reintroduction of the dye transfer process">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reintroduction of the dye transfer process</span></h3>
<p>After its reintroduction in 1997, the dye transfer process was (somewhat unexpectedly) used in several big-budget, modern <a href="/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="Cinema of the United States">Hollywood</a> productions. These included <i><a href="/wiki/Bulworth" title="Bulworth">Bulworth</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_(film)" title="Pearl Harbor (film)">Pearl Harbor</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Toy_Story" title="Toy Story">Toy Story</a></i>. The distinct "look" this process achieves, often sought after by filmmakers looking to re-create the period of time at which Technicolor was at its most prominent, is difficult to obtain through conventional, high-speed printing methods and is one explanation for the enduring demand and credibility of the process.</p>
<p>The latest motion picture dye IB (imbibition) transfer process developed during the 1990s is greatly superior to the process used during the 1970s and of much higher quality than modern Eastmancolor stocks. The prints exhibited a higher color gamut and color saturation than modern Eastmancolor stock and could be made consistently and accurately for large numbers of prints. There were no longer visible density and contrast variations that occurred most often with earlier three color Technicolor. The new process was also about as sharp as modern Eastmancolor process with slightly higher contrast, but they appeared sharper due to the higher contrast.</p>
<p>The dye-transfer process was discontinued in 2002.</p>
<p>The visual aesthetic of dye transfer Technicolor continues to be used in Hollywood, usually in films set in the mid-20th century. Parts of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Aviator" title="The Aviator">The Aviator</a></i>, the 2004 biopic of Howard Hughes, were digitally manipulated to imitate color processes that were available during the periods each scene takes place. The two-color look of the film is incorrectly cited as looking like Technicolor's two-color systems, and is in fact a facsimile of Hughes' own color system, <a href="/wiki/Multicolor" title="Multicolor">Multicolor</a>. The "three-strip" Technicolor look begins after the newsreel footage of Hughes making the first flight around the world.</p>

<dd>Technicolor was still making the double-coated cemented together relief prints, so that the red and green images were not quite in the same plane, and the pictures didn't project too sharply on the screen This double-coated film is considerably thicker than ordinary black-and-white film, with emulsion on both sides which tends to make it cup more readily and scratch more noticeably than black-and-white film. And the cupping could occur in either direction, more or less at random. Judging from the complaints, at each such change in the direction of the cupping, the picture would jump out of focus.</dd>

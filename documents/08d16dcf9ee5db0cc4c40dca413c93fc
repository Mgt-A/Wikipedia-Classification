<p>His Romanian surname "Drăculea" means "Son of Dracula" and is derived from his father's title, Vlad the Devil (see <a href="/wiki/Vlad_II_Dracul" title="Vlad II Dracul">Vlad II Dracul</a>); the latter was a member of the <b><a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Dragon" title="Order of the Dragon">Order of the Dragon</a></b> created by <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Sigismund" title="Emperor Sigismund" class="mw-redirect">Emperor Sigismund</a>.

His son Vlad III would later use in several documents the surname "Drăculea". Through various translations ("Draculea", "Drakulya") Vlad III eventually came to be known as "Dracula" (note that this ultimate version is a <a href="/wiki/Neologism" title="Neologism">neologism</a>).</p>

<p>Vlad was very likely born in the <a href="/wiki/Citadel" title="Citadel">citadel</a> of <a href="/wiki/Sighi%C5%9Foara" title="Sighişoara">Sighişoara</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transylvania" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a> in 1431.

Although his native country was <a href="/wiki/Wallachia" title="Wallachia">Wallachia</a> to the south, the family lived in <a href="/wiki/Exile" title="Exile">exile</a> in Transylvania as his father had been ousted by pro-Ottoman <a href="/wiki/Boyar" title="Boyar">boyars</a>.

<p>Vlad's father was under considerable political pressure from the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Dynasty" title="Ottoman Dynasty">Ottoman sultan</a>. Threatened with invasion, he gave a promise to be the <a href="/wiki/Vassal" title="Vassal">vassal</a> of the sultan and gave up his two younger sons as hostages so that he would keep his promise. Vlad developed a well-known hatred for Radu and for Mehmed, who would later become the sultan. According to McNally and Florescu, he also distrusted his own father for trading him to the Turks and betraying the Order of the Dragon's oath to fight them.</p>

<p>Vlad's father was assassinated in the marshes near Bălteni in December 1447 by rebellious <a href="/wiki/Boyar" title="Boyar">boyars</a> allegedly under the orders of Hungarian regent <a href="/wiki/John_Hunyadi" title="John Hunyadi">John Hunyadi</a>. Vlad's older brother Mircea was also dead at this point, <a href="/wiki/Blindness" title="Blindness">blinded</a> with hot iron stakes and buried alive by his political enemies at <a href="/wiki/T%C3%A2rgovi%C5%9Fte" title="Târgovişte">Târgovişte</a>. To protect their political power in the region, the Ottomans invaded Wallachia and the Sultan put Vlad III on the throne as a puppet ruler. His rule at this time would be brief; Hunyadi himself invaded Wallachia and ousted him the same year. Vlad fled to Moldavia until October 1451 and was put under the protection of his uncle, <a href="/wiki/Bogdan_II" title="Bogdan II" class="mw-redirect">Bogdan II</a>.</p>

<p>Bogdan was assassinated by <a href="/wiki/Petru_Aron" title="Petru Aron">Petru Aron</a>, and Vlad, taking a gamble, fled to Hungary. Impressed by Vlad's vast knowledge of the mindset and inner workings of the Ottoman Empire as well as his hatred of the new sultan <a href="/wiki/Mehmed_II" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a>, Hunyadi pardoned him and took him in as an advisor. Eventually Hunyadi put him forward as the Kingdom of Hungary's candidate for the throne of Wallachia.</p>
<p>In 1453, the Ottomans, under Mehmed II, took <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> after a prolonged siege, thus putting an end to the final major Christian presence in the eastern <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean" class="mw-redirect">Mediterranean</a>.

<p>In 1456, Hungary invaded <a href="/wiki/Serbia" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> to drive out the Ottomans, and Vlad III simultaneously invaded Wallachia with his own contingent. Both campaigns were successful, although Hunyadi died suddenly of the plague. Nevertheless, Vlad was now prince of his native land.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Vlad_III_the_Impaler&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Main reign (1456–1462)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Main reign (1456–1462)</span></h3>
<p>Vlad III's actions after 1456 are well-documented.</p>
<p>After the death of his grandfather (Mircea the Elder) in 1418, Wallachia had fallen into a somewhat chaotic situation. A constant state of war had led to rampant crime, falling agricultural production, and the virtual disappearance of trade. Vlad used severe methods to restore order, as he needed an economically stable country if he was to have any chance against his external enemies.</p>
<p>The early part of Vlad’s reign was dominated by the idea of eliminating all possible threats to his power, mainly the rival nobility groups, i.e. the boyars. This was done mainly by physical elimination, but also by reducing the economic role of the nobility: the key positions in the Prince’s Council, traditionally belonging to the country’s greatest boyars, were handed to obscure individuals, some of them of foreign origin, but who manifested loyalty towards Vlad. For the less important functions, Vlad also ignored the old boyars, preferring to <a href="/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knight</a> and appoint men from the free <a href="/wiki/Peasantry" title="Peasantry" class="mw-redirect">peasantry</a>. A key element of the power of the Wallachian nobility was their connections in the <a href="/wiki/Transylvanian_Saxons" title="Transylvanian Saxons">Saxon</a>-populated autonomous towns of Transylvania, so Vlad acted against these cities by eliminating their trade privileges in relation with Wallachia and by organizing raids against them. In 1459, he had several of the German settlers (Saxons) and officials of the <a href="/wiki/Transylvania" title="Transylvania">Transylvanian</a> city of <a href="/wiki/Bra%C5%9Fov" title="Braşov">Kronstadt</a> who were transgressing his authority impaled.<sup id="cite_ref-Vlad_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Vlad-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Vlad III was constantly on guard against the adherents of the Dăneşti clan, and some of his raids into Transylvania may have been efforts to capture the clan's would-be princes. Several members of the clan died at Vlad's hands. <a href="/wiki/Vladislav_II_of_Wallachia" title="Vladislav II of Wallachia">Vladislav II of Wallachia</a> was murdered soon after Vlad came to power in 1456. Another Dăneşti prince, suspected to have taken part in burying his brother Mircea alive, was captured during one of Vlad's forays into Transylvania. Rumors (spread by his enemies) say thousands of citizens of the town that had sheltered his rival were impaled by Vlad. The captured prince was forced to read his own <a href="/wiki/Eulogy" title="Eulogy">eulogy</a> while kneeling before an open grave before his execution.</p>

<p>Following family traditions and due to his old hatred towards the Ottomans, Vlad decided to side with the Hungarians. To the end of the 1450s there was once again talk about a war against the Turks, in which the king of Hungary <a href="/wiki/Matthias_Corvinus" title="Matthias Corvinus" class="mw-redirect">Matthias Corvinus</a> would play the main role. Knowing this, Vlad stopped paying tribute to the Ottomans in 1459 and around 1460 made a new alliance with Corvinus. This angered the Turks, who attempted to remove him. They failed, however; later in the winter of 1461 to 1462 Vlad crossed south of the <a href="/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danube</a> and devastated the area between Serbia and the <a href="/wiki/Black_Sea" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>. In Vlad's own words -: <i>"I have killed men and women, old and young...23,884 Turks and Bulgarians without counting those whom we burned alive in their homes or whose heads were not chopped off by our soldiers..."</i><sup id="cite_ref-Vlad_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Vlad-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In response to this, <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Dynasty" title="Ottoman Dynasty">Sultan</a> <a href="/wiki/Mehmed_II" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a>, the recent conqueror of <a href="/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, raised an army of around 60,000 troops and 30,000 irregulars and in the spring of 1462 headed towards Wallachia. Other estimates for the army include 150,000 by Michael Doukas, 250,000 by Laonicus Chalcond. Mehmed was greeted by the sight of a veritable forest of stakes on which Vlad the Impaler had impaled 20,000 Turkish prisoners.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> With his army of 20,000–40,000 men Vlad was unable to stop the Turks from entering Wallachia and occupying the capital Târgovişte (4 June 1462), so he resorted to <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>, constantly organizing small attacks and ambushes on the Turks. The most important of these attacks took place on the nights of June 16–17, when Vlad and some of his men allegedly entered the main Turkish camp (wearing Ottoman disguises) and attempted to assassinate Mehmed. Unable to subdue Vlad, the Turks left the country, leaving Vlad's half-brother, <a href="/wiki/Radu_the_Handsome" title="Radu the Handsome" class="mw-redirect">Radu the Handsome</a>, to continue fighting. Despite Vlad achieving military victories, he had alienated himself from the nobility, which sided with Radu. By August 1462 Radu had struck a deal with the Hungarian Crown. Consequently, Vlad was imprisoned by Matthias Corvinus.</p>
<p>His first wife, whose name is not recorded, died during the siege of his castle in 1462. The Turkish army surrounded <a href="/wiki/Poienari_Castle" title="Poienari Castle" class="mw-redirect">Poienari Castle</a>, led by Radu. An archer shot an arrow through a window into Vlad's main quarters, with a message warning him that Radu's army was approaching. McNally and Florescu explain that the archer was one of Vlad's former servants who sent the warning out of loyalty, despite having <a href="/wiki/Religious_conversion" title="Religious conversion">converted</a> to Islam to escape <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">enslavement</a> by the Turks. Upon reading the message, Vlad's wife threw herself from the tower into a tributary of the <a href="/wiki/Arge%C5%9F_River" title="Argeş River">Argeş River</a> flowing below the castle. According to legend, she remarked that she "would rather have her body rot and be eaten by the fish of the Argeş than be led into captivity by the Turks". Today, the tributary is called <a href="/wiki/R%C3%A2ul_Doamnei" title="Râul Doamnei">Râul Doamnei</a> (the Lady's River, also called the Princess's River).</p>

<p>The exact length of Vlad's period of captivity is open to some debate, though indications are that it was from 1462 until 1474. He was able to gradually win his way back into the graces of Hungary's monarch, and eventually marry a member of the royal family. His second wife, Countess <a href="/wiki/Ilona_Szil%C3%A1gy" title="Ilona Szilágy" class="mw-redirect">Ilona Szilágyi</a> (the cousin of Matthias), bore him two sons, Vlad Dracula &amp; another son whose name is unknown, who were about ten years old when he reconquered Wallachia in 1476. Diplomatic correspondence from <a href="/wiki/Buda" title="Buda">Buda</a> during the period in question also seems to support the claim that Vlad's actual period of confinement was relatively short.</p>
<p>The openly pro-Turkish policy of Radu (who was prince of Wallachia during most of Vlad's captivity), was a probable factor in Vlad's rehabilitation. During his captivity, Vlad also converted to <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholicism</a>, in contrast to his brother who converted to <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>. In the years before his final release in 1474, when he began preparations for the reconquest of Wallachia, Vlad resided with his new wife in a house in the Hungarian capital.</p>

<p>His first wife, whose name was not recorded but spoken about in Romanian folk tales, was known to be a woman of innocence and beauty who bore a heart of gold. Together they had a son, <a href="/wiki/Mihnea_cel_R%C4%83u" title="Mihnea cel Rău">Mihnea cel Rău</a>, who would rule Wallachia 1508 to 1510. During a Turkish raid, his first wife flung herself out of fear for her life, from Castle Poenari along the Argeş River. Vlad III would not marry again until after his imprisonment in Hungary in the 1460s. His second wife, Countess <a href="/wiki/Ilona_Szil%C3%A1gy" title="Ilona Szilágy" class="mw-redirect">Ilona Szilágy</a> (the cousin of Matthias) and he had two sons, Vlad Dracula and another son whose name is unknown.

Vlad Dracula was a claimant to the Wallachian throne, but never ruled. The Hungarian branch of his descendants married into nobility off and on, but never ruled Wallachia.

<p>When he came to power, Vlad immediately had all the assembled nobles arrested. The older boyars and their families were impaled on the spot. The younger and healthier nobles and their families were marched north from Târgovişte to the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Poienari_Castle" title="Poienari Castle" class="mw-redirect">Poienari Castle</a> in the mountains above the Argeş River. Vlad was determined to rebuild this ancient fortress as his own stronghold and refuge. The enslaved boyars and their families were forced to labor for months, rebuilding the old castle with materials from another nearby ruin. According to tradition, they labored until the clothes fell off their bodies and then were forced to continue working naked. Very few of the old <a href="/wiki/Gentry" title="Gentry">gentry</a> survived the ordeal of building Vlad's castle.</p>
<p>Throughout his reign, Vlad systematically eradicated the old boyar class of Wallachia. The old boyars had repeatedly undermined the power of the prince during previous reigns and had been responsible for the violent overthrow of several princes. Vlad was determined that his own power be on a modern and thoroughly secure footing. In place of the executed boyars, Vlad promoted new men from among the free peasantry and middle class, who would be loyal only to their prince.</p>
<p>Vlad Ţepeş's reputation was considerably darker in <a href="/wiki/Western_Europe" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> than in <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Europe" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> and Romania. In the West, Vlad III Ţepeş has been characterized as a tyrant who took <a href="/wiki/Sadism" title="Sadism">sadistic</a> pleasure in torturing and killing his enemies. The number of his victims ranges from 40,000 to 100,000.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> According to the <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a> stories the number of victims he had killed was at least 80,000. In addition to the 80,000 victims mentioned he also had whole villages and fortresses destroyed and burned to the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> These numbers are most likely exaggerated.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The atrocities committed by Vlad in the German stories include impaling, torturing, burning, skinning, roasting, and boiling people, feeding people the flesh of their friends or relatives, cutting off limbs, drowning, and nailing people's hats to their heads. His victims included men and women of all ages, religions and social classes, children and babies. One German account includes the following sentence: "He caused so much pain and suffering that even the most bloodthirstiest persecutors of Christianity like <a href="/wiki/Herodes" title="Herodes" class="mw-redirect">Herodes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nero" title="Nero">Nero</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diocletian" title="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> and all other <a href="/wiki/Pagan" title="Pagan" class="mw-redirect">pagans</a> combined hadn’t even thought of."<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Impalement" title="Impalement">Impalement</a> was Ţepeş's preferred method of torture and execution. His method of torture was a horse attached to each of the victim's legs as a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body. The end of the stake was usually oiled, and care was taken that the stake not be too sharp; else the victim might die too rapidly from shock. Normally the stake was inserted into the body through the <a href="/wiki/Anus" title="Anus">anus</a> and was often forced through the body until it emerged from the mouth. However, there were many instances where victims were impaled through other bodily orifices or through the <a href="/wiki/Abdomen" title="Abdomen">abdomen</a> or chest. Infants were sometimes impaled on the stake forced through their mother's chests. The records indicate that victims were sometimes impaled so that they hung upside down on the stake.</p>
<p>As expected, death by impalement was slow and painful. Victims sometimes endured for hours or days. Vlad often had the stakes arranged in various geometric patterns. The most common pattern was a ring of concentric circles in the outskirts of a city that constituted his target. The height of the spear indicated the rank of the victim. The corpses were often left decaying for months.</p>
<p>There are claims that thousands of people were impaled at a single time. One such claim says 10,000 were impaled in the Transylvanian city of <a href="/wiki/Sibiu" title="Sibiu">Sibiu</a> (where Vlad had once lived) in 1460. Another allegation asserts that during the previous year, on <a href="/wiki/Saint_Bartholomew%27s_Day" title="Saint Bartholomew's Day" class="mw-redirect">Saint Bartholomew's Day</a> (in August), Vlad had 30,000 of the merchants and officials of the Transylvanian city of <a href="/wiki/Bra%C5%9Fov" title="Braşov">Braşov</a> impaled for breaking his authority. One of the most famous <a href="/wiki/Woodcut" title="Woodcut">woodcuts</a> of the period shows Vlad feasting in a forest of stakes and their grisly burdens outside Braşov, while a nearby executioner cuts apart other victims.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Vlad Ţepeş is alleged to have committed even more impalements and other tortures against invading Ottoman forces. It was reported that an invading <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> army turned back in fright when it encountered thousands of rotting corpses impaled on the banks of the Danube.<sup id="cite_ref-Vlad_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Vlad-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> It has also been said that in 1462 <a href="/wiki/Mehmed_II" title="Mehmed II">Mehmed II</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople" title="Fall of Constantinople">conqueror of Constantinople</a>, a man noted for his own psychological warfare tactics, returned to Constantinople after being sickened by the sight of 20,000 impaled corpses outside Vlad's capital of Târgovişte. Many of the victims were Turkish prisoners of war Vlad had previously captured during the Turkish invasion. The total Turkish casualty toll in this battle reached over 40,000. The warrior sultan turned command of the campaign against Vlad over to subordinates and returned to Constantinople, even though his army had initially outnumbered Vlad's three to one and was better equipped.</p>

<p>The German stories circulated first in <a href="/wiki/Manuscript" title="Manuscript">manuscript</a> form in the late 15th century and the first manuscript was probably written in 1462 before Vlad’s arrest.<sup id="cite_ref-Andreescu_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Andreescu-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The text was later printed in Germany and had major impact on the general public becoming a best-seller of its time with numerous later editions adding and altering the original text.</p>
<p>In addition to the manuscripts and pamphlets the German version of the stories can be found in the poem of Michel Beheim. The poem called <i>"Von ainem wutrich der hies Trakle waida von der Walachei"</i> ("Story of a Bloodthirsty Madman Called Dracula of Wallachia") was written and performed at the court of <a href="/wiki/Frederick_III,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor">Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor</a> during the winter of 1463.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>To this day four manuscripts and 13 pamphlets are found as well as the poem by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Michel_Beheim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Michel Beheim (page does not exist)">Michel Beheim</a>. The surviving manuscripts date from the last quarter of the 15th century to the year 1500 and the found pamphlets date from 1488 to 1559–1568.</p>
<p>Eight of the pamphlets are <a href="/wiki/Incunabulum" title="Incunabulum">incunabula</a>: they were printed before 1501. The German stories about Vlad Ţepeş consist of 46 short episodes, although none of the manuscripts, pamphlets or the poem of Beheim contain all 46 stories.</p>
<p>All of them begin with the story of the old governor, <a href="/wiki/John_Hunyadi" title="John Hunyadi">John Hunyadi</a>, having Vlad's father killed, and how Vlad and his brother renounced their old religion and swore to protect and uphold the Christian faith. After this, the order and titles of the stories differs by manuscript and pamphlet editions.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The German stories were written most likely for political reasons, especially to blacken the image of the Wallachian ruler. The first version of the German text was probably written in Braşov by a Saxon scholar. According to some researchers, the writer expressed the general feelings of the Saxons in Braşov and Sibiu who had borne the brunt of Vlad’s wrath in 1456–1457 and again in 1458–1459 and 1460.</p>
<p>Against this political and cultural backdrop, it is quite easy to understand the hostility towards Vlad Ţepeş. Although there is historic background for the events described in the German stories, some are either exaggerated or even fictitious.</p>
<p>The Transylvanian king <a href="/wiki/Matei_Corvin" title="Matei Corvin" class="mw-redirect">Matei Corvin</a>, also called Corvinus, also had political reasons for promoting Vlad's image as an evil prince. Corvinus had received large subsidies from Rome and Venice for the war against the Ottomans, but because of a conflict with <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Frederick_III" title="Emperor Frederick III">Emperor Frederick III</a>, he couldn’t afford the military support for the fight.</p>
<p>By making Vlad a scapegoat, Corvinus could justify his reasons for not taking part in the war against the Ottomans. He arrested Vlad and used a forged letter in which Vlad announced his loyalty to Mehmed II, as well as horror stories about Vlad, to justify his actions to the Pope. In 1462 and 1463, the court in Buda also fostered negative stories of Vlad in central and Eastern Europe, and capitalized on the horrors attributed to him.<sup id="cite_ref-Andreescu_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Andreescu-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The stories eventually changed from propaganda to literature and became very popular in the German world in the 15th and 16th centuries. Part of the reason for this success was the newly-invented printing press, which allowed the texts to filter to a wide audience.</p>

<p>In later accounts of these stories, Vlad's atrocities against the people of Wallachia have sometimes been interpreted as attempts to enforce his own moral code upon his country. According to the pamphlets, he appears to have been particularly concerned with female <a href="/wiki/Chastity" title="Chastity">chastity</a>. <a href="/wiki/Maiden" title="Maiden" class="mw-redirect">Maidens</a> who lost their <a href="/wiki/Virginity" title="Virginity">virginity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adultery" title="Adultery">adulterous</a> wives, and unchaste widows were all targets of Vlad's cruelty. Such women often had their sexual organs cut out or their breasts cut off. They were also often impaled through the <a href="/wiki/Vagina" title="Vagina">vagina</a> on red-hot stakes that were forced through the body until they emerged from the mouth.<sup id="cite_ref-dontlike_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dontlike-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> One report tells of the execution of an unfaithful wife. The woman's breasts were cut off, then she was skinned and impaled in a square in Târgovişte with her skin lying on a nearby table. Vlad also insisted that his people be honest and hard-working. Merchants who cheated their customers were likely to find themselves mounted on a stake beside common thieves.</p>

<p>The Russian or the Slavic version of the stories about Vlad Ţepeş called "Skazakie o Drakule voevode" ("The Tale of Prince Dracula") is thought to have been written sometime between 1481 and 1486. Copies were made from the 15th century to the 18th century, of which some twenty-two extant manuscripts survive in Russian archives.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> The oldest one, from 1490, ends as follows: "First written in the year 6994 (1486), on 13 February; then transcribed by me, the sinner Elfrosin, in the year 6998 (1490), on 28 January". The Tales of Prince Dracula is neither chronological nor consistent, but mostly a collection of anecdotes of literary and historical value concerning Vlad Ţepeş.</p>
<p>There are 19 anecdotes in The Tales of Prince Dracula which are longer and more constructed than the German stories. It can be divided into two sections: The first 13 episodes are non-chronological events most likely closer to the original folkloric oral tradition about Vlad. The last six episodes are thought to have been written by a scholar who collected them, because they are chronological and seem to be more structured. The stories begin with a short introduction and the anecdote about the nailing of hats to ambassadors heads. They end with Vlad's death and information about his family.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Of the 19 anecdotes there are ten that have similarities to the German stories.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Although there are similarities between the Russian and the German stories about Vlad, there is a clear distinction with the attitude towards him. The Russian stories tend to give him a more positive image: he is depicted as a great ruler, a brave soldier and a just sovereign. Stories of atrocities tend to seem to be justified as the actions of a strong ruler. Of the 19 anecdotes, only four seem to have exaggerated violence.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Some elements of the anecdotes were later added to Russian stories about <a href="/wiki/Ivan_IV" title="Ivan IV" class="mw-redirect">Ivan the Terrible</a> of Russia.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The nationality and identity of the original writer of the anecdotes Dracula is disputed. The two most plausible explanations are that the writer was either a Romanian priest or a monk from Transylvania, or a Romanian or Moldavian from the court of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_the_Great" title="Stephen the Great" class="mw-redirect">Stephen the Great</a> in Moldova. One theory claims the writer was a Russian diplomat named Fedor Kuritsyn.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>It is most likely that <a href="/wiki/Bram_Stoker" title="Bram Stoker">Bram Stoker</a> found the name for his <a href="/wiki/Vampire" title="Vampire">vampire</a> from <a href="/wiki/William_Wilkinson" title="William Wilkinson">William Wilkinson</a>'s book, "<a href="/w/index.php?title=An_Account_of_the_Principalities_of_Wallachia_and_Moldavia:_with_various_Political_Observations_Relating_to_Them&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia: with various Political Observations Relating to Them (page does not exist)">An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia: with various Political Observations Relating to Them</a>". It is known that Stoker made notes about this book.<sup id="cite_ref-Miller_2000_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Miller_2000-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> It is also suggested by some that because Stoker was a friend of a Hungarian professor (Arminius Vambery/Hermann Bamberger/<a href="/wiki/%C3%81rmin_V%C3%A1mb%C3%A9ry" title="Ármin Vámbéry">Ármin Vámbéry</a>) from <a href="/wiki/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a>, Vlad's name might have been mentioned by this friend. Regardless of how the name came to Stoker's attention, the cruel history of the Impaler would have readily lent itself to Stoker's purposes.</p>
<p>However, recent research suggests that Stoker actually knew little about the Prince of Wallachia.<sup id="cite_ref-Miller_2000_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Miller_2000-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Some have claimed that the novel owes more to the legends about possibly the most prolific female serial killer in history <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory" title="Elizabeth Báthory" class="mw-redirect">Elizabeth Báthory</a>, a 16th century Hungarian countess who murdered hundreds of her servants. ("See <a href="/wiki/Dracula#Historical_connections" title="Dracula">Dracula—Historical connections</a> for more detail").</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Dracula_in_popular_culture" title="Dracula in popular culture">legend of the vampire</a> was and still is deeply rooted in that region. There have always been vampire-like creatures in various stories from across the world. However, the vampire, as he became known in Europe, largely originated in <a href="/wiki/Slavic_peoples" title="Slavic peoples">Southern Slavic</a> <a href="/wiki/Folklore" title="Folklore">folklore</a> — although the tale is absent in Romanian culture. A veritable epidemic of <a href="/wiki/Vampirism" title="Vampirism" class="mw-redirect">vampirism</a> swept through Eastern Europe beginning in the late 17th century and continuing through the 1700s. The number of reported cases rose dramatically in Hungary and the Balkans. From the Balkans, the "plague" spread westward into <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Travelers returning from the Balkans brought with them tales of the <a href="/wiki/Undead" title="Undead">undead</a>, igniting an interest in the vampire that has continued to this day. Philosophers in the West began to study the phenomenon. It was during this period that <a href="/wiki/Antoine_Augustin_Calmet" title="Antoine Augustin Calmet">Dom Augustine Calmet</a> wrote his famous treatise on vampirism in Hungary. It was also during this period that authors and playwrights first began to explore the vampire legend. Stoker's novel was merely the culminating work of a long series of works that were inspired by the reports coming from the Balkans and Hungary.</p>
<p>Given the history of the vampire legend in Europe, it is perhaps natural that Stoker should place his great vampire in the heart of the region that gave birth to the story. Once Stoker had determined on a locality, Vlad Dracula would stand out as one of the most notorious rulers of the selected region. He was obscure enough that few would recognize the name and those who did would know him for his acts of brutal cruelty; Dracula was a natural candidate for vampirism.</p>
<p>Tales of vampires are still widespread in Eastern Europe. Similarly, the name of Dracula is still remembered in the Romanian oral tradition but that is the end of any connection between Dracula and the folkloric vampire. Outside of Stoker's novel the name of Dracula was never linked with the vampires encountered in the folklore. Despite his alleged inhuman cruelty, in Romania Dracula is remembered as a national hero who resisted the Turkish conquerors and asserted Romanian national sovereignty against the powerful Hungarian kingdom. He is also remembered in a similar manner in other <a href="/wiki/Balkan" title="Balkan" class="mw-redirect">Balkan</a> countries, as he fought against the Turks.</p>
<p>It is somewhat ironic that Vlad's name has often been thrown into the political and ethnic feuds between Hungarians and Romanians, because he was ultimately far from an enemy of Hungary. While he certainly had violent conflicts with some Hungarian nobles, he had just as many Hungarian friends and allies, and his successes in battle with the Turks largely benefited Hungary in the long term. Hungary later found itself under siege but was never entirely penetrated by Ottoman forces. Though neither the first nor the last powerful ruler to take on the Ottoman Empire, Vlad's battle tactics were quite influential in damaging the impression of Turkish invincibility among Europeans and reversing the European aura of appeasement.</p>
<p>Romanian folklore and poetry, on the other hand, paints Vlad Ţepeş as a hero. His favorite weapon being the stake, coupled with his reputation in his native country as a man who stood up to both foreign and domestic enemies, gives him the virtual opposite symbolism of Stoker's vampire. In Romania, he is considered one of the greatest leaders in the country's history, and was voted one of "100 Greatest Romanians" in the "<a href="/wiki/Mari_Rom%C3%A2ni" title="Mari Români" class="mw-redirect">Mari Români</a>" television series aired in 2006.</p>
<p>A description of Vlad Dracula survives courtesy of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Nicholas_of_Modrussa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nicholas of Modrussa (page does not exist)">Nicholas of Modrussa</a>, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was not very tall, but very stocky and strong, with a cruel and terrible appearance, a long straight nose, distended nostrils, a thin and reddish face in which the large wide-open green eyes were enframed by bushy black eyebrows, which made them appear threatening. His face and chin were shaven but for a moustache. The swollen temples increased the bulk of his head. A bull's neck supported the head, from which black curly locks were falling to his wide-shouldered person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His image in modern Romanian culture has been established in reaction to foreign perceptions: while Stoker's book did a lot to generate outrage with nationalists, it is the last part of a rather popular previous poem by <a href="/wiki/Mihai_Eminescu" title="Mihai Eminescu">Mihai Eminescu</a>, "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Scrisoarea_a_III-a&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Scrisoarea a III-a (page does not exist)">Scrisoarea a III-a</a>", that helped turn Vlad's image into modern legend, by having him stand as a figure to contrast with presumed social decay under the <a href="/wiki/Phanariotes" title="Phanariotes">Phanariotes</a> and the political scene of the 19th century (even suggesting that Vlad's violent methods be applied as a cure). This judgment was in tune with the ideology of the inward-looking <a href="/wiki/Regime" title="Regime">regime</a> of <a href="/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C5%9Fescu" title="Nicolae Ceauşescu">Nicolae Ceauşescu</a>, although the identification did little justice to Eminescu's personal beliefs.</p>
<p>All accounts of his life describe him as ruthless, but only the ones originating from his Saxon detractors paint him as sadistic or <a href="/wiki/Insane" title="Insane" class="mw-redirect">insane</a>. These pamphlets continued to be published long after his death, though usually for lurid entertainment rather than propaganda purposes. It has largely been forgotten until recently that his tenacious efforts against the Ottoman Empire won him many staunch supporters in his lifetime, not just in modern day Romania but in the Kingdom of Hungary, Poland, the <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Venice" title="Republic of Venice">Republic of Venice</a>, and even the <a href="/wiki/Holy_See" title="Holy See">Holy See</a>, not to take into account Balkan countries. A Hungarian court chronicler reported that King Matthias "had acted in opposition to general opinion" in Hungary when he had Dracula imprisoned, and this played a considerable part in Matthias reversing his unpopular decision. During his time as a "distinguished prisoner" before being fully pardoned and allowed to reconquer Wallachia, Vlad was hailed as a Christian hero by visitors from all over Europe.</p>

<p>Apart from the Dracula movies, which are partially based on Vlad as well as <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Bathory" title="Elizabeth Bathory" class="mw-redirect">Elizabeth Bathory</a>, there has been comparatively fewer movies about the man who inspired the vampire. In 1979, Romania released a movie based on his six-year reign and his brief return to power in late 1476 called "Vlad Ţepeş" (sometimes known, in other countries, as "The True Story of Vlad the Impaler"), in which the character is portrayed with a mostly positive perspective, while, at the same time, also mentioning the excesses of his regime and his practice of impalement.

<p>The 2000 movie "<a href="/wiki/Dark_Prince:_The_True_Story_of_Dracula" title="Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula">Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula</a>",<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> filmed on location in Hungary and starring <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Martin" title="Rudolf Martin">Rudolf Martin</a>, attempts to portray Vlad the Impaler as a generally sympathetic, <a href="/wiki/Tragic_hero" title="Tragic hero">tragic</a> figure. The film takes a number of liberties with the details of his life, but remains overall a fairly accurate outline of his story. It portrays Vlad as the ruthless ruler/hero he has been known to be, but it also goes on to portray him as the seductive vampire, Dracula, of the popular novel and movies.</p>
<p>In literature, he is found as a main character of the book "<a href="/wiki/The_Historian" title="The Historian">The Historian</a>", written by <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Kostova" title="Elizabeth Kostova">Elizabeth Kostova</a>, and published in 2005.

<p>The 1992 <a href="/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> film "<a href="/wiki/Bram_Stoker%27s_Dracula" title="Bram Stoker's Dracula" class="mw-redirect">Bram Stoker's Dracula</a>", based on Bram Stoker's novel, claims that the Dracula character is truly Vlad the Impaler. In the opening of the film, which is set in Transylvania in 1462, he leaves his beloved wife Elisabeta at his castle to fight an army of Turks, who have invaded Transylvania and are threatening all of Christendom. Vlad Draculea, as he is known in the film, leads his army to victory against the Turks and impales many of them on stakes, before praising God for his triumph. However, he then experiences a <a href="/wiki/Premonition" title="Premonition">premonition</a> in which Elisabeta flings herself out of the window of the castle to her death in the river hundreds of feet below, since the surviving Turks shot an arrow through the castle window, with a letter attached to it falsely informing her of Vlad's death in the battle. Rushing back to the castle, a distraught Vlad is shown his wife's dead body in the chapel, and is told by an elderly priest that due to her suicide, Elisabeta's soul cannot enter <a href="/wiki/Heaven" title="Heaven">heaven</a>. Overcome with grief and anger, Vlad renounces God and proceeds to plunge his sword into a stone crucifix nearby, causing blood to gush out of the hole and fill up the floor of the entire chapel. Vlad then swears that he will live beyond his own death and avenge Elisabeta's death with all the powers of darkness, and then drinks some of the blood from a goblet next to the stone <a href="/wiki/Crucifix" title="Crucifix">crucifix</a>.</p>
<p>Over 400 years later, in 1897, Vlad is still alive in Transylvania and is revealed through the course of the film to have been transformed into a vampire, becoming known as Dracula and possessing all of the strengths and weaknesses described in Bram Stoker's novel. The film then follows the plot of the novel, except the character of Mina Harker is revealed to be the reincarnation of Elisabeta, sharing her exact physical appearance, and a passionate romance between Mina and Dracula is added in the film to coincide with the opening of the film (Dracula turning Mina into a vampire so they can be together as husband and wife for an eternity, just as he and Elisabeta were meant to be together all of their lives). In the climax of the film, once Dracula has been fatally wounded by having his throat slashed and a hunting knife embedded into his heart, Mina/Elisabeta provides the finishing blow by impaling the dying Vlad/Dracula to the floor with the knife, who reverts back to his original appearance and then dies. Through Dracula's death, Mina is freed of the vampire's curse, in accordance with the novel.</p>
<p>The film presents Vlad the Impaler as a brutal but tragic character who became the immortal vampire Dracula out of his love for his deceased wife, and shows his actions to be his own personal war against God for denying the entry of Elisabeta's soul into heaven, mixing historical fact with the fiction of Bram Stoker's character. His appearance as Vlad is similar to historical depictions of Vlad the Impaler; his suit of armour in the battle against the Turks has a distinct wolf-like appearance; he is shown to be able to fight multiple armed men single-handedly, both as Vlad and Dracula, and golden dragons appear frequently on his clothes and in his castle once he becomes the vampire Dracula. In the film, Vlad/Dracula was played by <a href="/wiki/Gary_Oldman" title="Gary Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>, and Elisabeta/Mina was played by <a href="/wiki/Winona_Ryder" title="Winona Ryder">Winona Ryder</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>Battle of Tours</b> (October 10, 732),<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> also called the <b>Battle of Poitiers</b> and in <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">معركة بلاط الشهداء</span>‎ (ma‘arakat Balâṭ ash-Shuhadâ’) <i>Battle of Court of The Martyrs</i><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>, was fought in an area between the cities of <a href="/wiki/Poitiers" title="Poitiers">Poitiers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tours" title="Tours">Tours</a>, near the village of Moussais-la-Bataille (modern <a href="/wiki/Vouneuil-sur-Vienne" title="Vouneuil-sur-Vienne">Vouneuil-sur-Vienne</a>) about 20&#160;kilometres (12&#160;mi) north of Poitiers. The location of the battle was close to the border between the Frankish realm and then-independent <a href="/wiki/Aquitaine" title="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>. The battle pitted <a href="/wiki/Franks" title="Franks">Frankish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Burgundians" title="Burgundians">Burgundian</a><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> forces under <a href="/wiki/Austrasia" title="Austrasia">Austrasian</a> <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_the_Palace" title="Mayor of the Palace">Mayor of the Palace</a> <a href="/wiki/Charles_Martel" title="Charles Martel">Charles Martel</a> against an army of the <a href="/wiki/Umayyad" title="Umayyad" class="mw-redirect">Umayyad</a> Caliphate led by <a href="/wiki/Abdul_Rahman_Al_Ghafiqi" title="Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi">‘Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi</a>, Governor-general of <a href="/wiki/Al-Andalus" title="Al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>. The Franks were victorious, ‘Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi was killed, and Charles subsequently extended his authority in the south. Ninth-century chroniclers, who interpreted the outcome of the battle as divine judgment in his favour, gave Charles the nickname <i>Martellus</i> ("The Hammer"), possibly recalling <a href="/wiki/Judas_Maccabeus" title="Judas Maccabeus">Judas Maccabeus</a> ("The Hammerer") of the <a href="/wiki/Maccabean_revolt" title="Maccabean revolt" class="mw-redirect">Maccabean revolt</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Riche.2C_1993.2C_p._44_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Riche.2C_1993.2C_p._44-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Details of the battle, including its exact location and the exact number of combatants, cannot be determined from accounts that have survived. Notably, the Frankish troops won the battle without cavalry.<sup id="cite_ref-Schoenfeld.2C_2001.2C_p._366_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Schoenfeld.2C_2001.2C_p._366-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As later chroniclers praised Charles Martel as the champion of Christianity, pre-20th century historians began to characterize this battle as being the decisive turning point in the struggle against Islam, a struggle which preserved Christianity as the religion of Europe. "Most of the 18th and 19th century historians, like Gibbon, saw Poitiers (Tours), as a landmark battle that marked the high tide of the Muslim advance into Europe."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke" title="Leopold von Ranke">Leopold von Ranke</a> felt that "Poitiers was the turning point of one of the most important epochs in the history of the world."<sup id="cite_ref-Ranke_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ranke-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>While modern historians are divided and there is considerable disagreement as to whether or not the victory was responsible — as Gibbon and his generation of historians claimed, and which is echoed by many modern historians — for saving <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and halting the conquest of Europe by <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>, there is little dispute that the battle helped lay the foundations of the <a href="/wiki/Carolingian_Empire" title="Carolingian Empire">Carolingian Empire</a> and Frankish domination of Europe for the next century. "The establishment of Frankish power in western Europe shaped that continent's destiny and the Battle of Tours confirmed that power."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The Battle of Tours followed 21 years of Umayyad conquests in Europe which had begun with the invasion of the <a href="/wiki/Visigoths" title="Visigoths">Visigothic</a> <a href="/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a> Kingdoms of the <a href="/wiki/Iberian_peninsula" title="Iberian peninsula" class="mw-redirect">Iberian peninsula</a> in 711.

Umayyad military campaigns had reached northward into Aquitaine and <a href="/wiki/Burgundy_(region)" title="Burgundy (region)">Burgundy</a>, including a major engagement at <a href="/wiki/Bordeaux" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> and a raid on <a href="/wiki/Autun" title="Autun">Autun</a>.

<p><i>Most historians assume</i> that the two armies met where the rivers <a href="/wiki/Clain" title="Clain">Clain</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vienne_River" title="Vienne River">Vienne</a> join between Tours and Poitiers. The number of troops in each army is not known. Drawing on non-contemporary Muslim sources, Creasy describes the Umayyad forces as 80,000 strong or more. Writing in 1999, Paul K.

Both Davis and Hanson point out that both armies had to live off the countryside, neither having a commissary system sufficient to provide supplies for a campaign. Losses during the battle are unknown but chroniclers later claimed that Charles Martel's force lost about 1,500 while the Umayyad force was said to have suffered massive casualties of up to 375,000 men.

The Umayyad Caliphate, at the time of the Battle of Tours, was perhaps the world’s foremost military power. Great expansion of the Caliphate occurred under the reign of the Umayyads. Muslim armies pushed across North Africa and <a href="/wiki/Persia" title="Persia" class="mw-redirect">Persia</a> through the late 600s; forces led by <a href="/wiki/Tariq_ibn-Ziyad" title="Tariq ibn-Ziyad" class="mw-redirect">Tariq ibn-Ziyad</a> crossed <a href="/wiki/Gibraltar" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and established Muslim power in the Iberian peninsula, while other armies established power far away in <a href="/wiki/Sind" title="Sind" class="mw-redirect">Sind</a>, in what is now the modern state of <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.

<p>The Frankish realm under Charles Martel was the foremost military power of Western Europe. It consisted of what is today most of France (Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy), most of Western Germany, and the low countries.

Al-Samh set up his capital from 720 at <a href="/wiki/Narbonne" title="Narbonne">Narbonne</a>, which the Moors called Arbūna.

<p>The Umayyad campaign into Aquitaine suffered a temporary setback at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Toulouse_(721)" title="Battle of Toulouse (721)">Battle of Toulouse (721)</a>, when Duke <a href="/wiki/Odo_of_Aquitaine" title="Odo of Aquitaine" class="mw-redirect">Odo of Aquitaine</a> (also known as Eudes the Great) broke the siege of <a href="/wiki/Toulouse" title="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, taking <a href="/wiki/Al-Samh_ibn_Malik" title="Al-Samh ibn Malik" class="mw-redirect">Al-Samh ibn Malik</a>'s forces by surprise and mortally wounding the governor-general Al-Samh ibn Malik himself. This defeat did not stop incursions into old Roman Gaul, as <a href="/wiki/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a> forces, soundly based in Narbonne and easily resupplied by sea, struck eastwards in the 720s, penetrating as far as <a href="/wiki/Autun" title="Autun">Autun</a> in <a href="/wiki/Burgundy_(region)" title="Burgundy (region)">Burgundy</a> in 725.</p>
<p>Threatened by both the Umayyads in the south and by the Franks in the north, in 730 Eudes allied himself with the Berber <a href="/wiki/Emir" title="Emir">emir</a> Uthman ibn Naissa, called "Munuza" by the Franks, the deputy governor of what would later become <a href="/wiki/Catalonia" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. As a gage, and to seal the alliance, Uthman was given Eudes's daughter Lampade in marriage, and Arab raids across the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, Eudes's southern border, ceased.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> However, the next year, Uthman rebelled against the governor of <a href="/wiki/Al-Andalus" title="Al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>, ‘Abd-al-Raḥmân, who quickly crushed the revolt and directed his attention against Eudes. ‘Abd-al-Raḥmân had brought a huge force of Arab heavy cavalry and Berber light cavalry, plus troops from all provinces of the Caliphate, in the Umayyad attempt at a conquest of Europe north of the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>. According to one unidentified <a href="/wiki/Arab" title="Arab">Arab</a>, <i>"That army went through all places like a desolating storm."</i> Duke Eudes (called King by some), collected his army at <a href="/wiki/Bordeaux" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, but was defeated, and Bordeaux was plundered. The slaughter of Christians at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Garonne" title="Battle of the River Garonne">Battle of the River Garonne</a> was evidently horrific; the <i><a href="/wiki/Mozarabic_Chronicle_of_754" title="Mozarabic Chronicle of 754" class="mw-redirect">Mozarabic Chronicle of 754</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> commented, "<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">solus Deus numerum morientium vel pereuntium recognoscat</span></i>", ("God alone knows the number of the slain").<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> The Umayyad horsemen then utterly devastated that portion of Gaul, their own histories saying the "faithful pierced through the mountains, trampled over rough and level ground, plundered far into the country of the Franks, and smote all with the sword, insomuch that when Eudo came to battle with them at the River Garonne, he fled."</p>

<p>Eudes appealed to the Franks for assistance, which Charles Martel only granted after Eudes agreed to submit to Frankish authority.</p>
<p>It appears as if the Umayyads were not aware of the true strength of the Franks. The Umayyad forces were not particularly concerned about any of the <a href="/wiki/Germanic_peoples" title="Germanic peoples">Germanic</a> tribes, including the Franks, and the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Arab_Chronicles&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Arab Chronicles (page does not exist)">Arab Chronicles</a>, the history of that age, show that awareness of the Franks as a growing military power only came after the Battle of Tours.</p>
<p>Further, the Umayyads appear not to have scouted northward for potential foes, for if they had, they surely would have noted Charles Martel as a force to be reckoned with in his own account, due to his thorough domination of Europe from 717: this might have alerted the Umayyads that a real power led by a gifted general was rising in the ashes of the <a href="/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire" title="Western Roman Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Advance_toward_the_Loire" id="Advance_toward_the_Loire"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Tours&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Advance toward the Loire">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Advance toward the Loire</span></h3>
<p>In 732, the Umayyad advance force was proceeding north toward the <a href="/wiki/River_Loire" title="River Loire" class="mw-redirect">River Loire</a> having outpaced their supply train and a large part of their army. Essentially, having easily destroyed all resistance in that part of Gaul, the invading army had split off into several raiding parties, while the main body advanced more slowly.</p>
<p>The Umayyad attack was likely so late in the year because many men and horses needed to live off the land as they advanced; thus they had to wait until the area's wheat <a href="/wiki/Harvest" title="Harvest">harvest</a> was ready and then until a reasonable amount of the harvest was <a href="/wiki/Threshing" title="Threshing">threshed</a> (slowly by hand with <a href="/wiki/Flail" title="Flail">flails</a>) and stored. The further north, the later the harvest is, and while the men could kill farm livestock for food, horses cannot eat meat and needed <a href="/wiki/Grain" title="Grain" class="mw-redirect">grain</a> as food. Letting them graze each day would take too long, and interrogating natives to find where food stores were kept would not work where the two sides had no common language.</p>
<p>A military explanation for why Eudes was defeated so easily at <a href="/wiki/Bordeaux" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> and at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Garonne" title="Battle of the River Garonne">Battle of the River Garonne</a> after having won 11 years earlier at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Toulouse" title="Battle of Toulouse">Battle of Toulouse</a> is simple. At Toulouse, Eudes managed a basic surprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe, all of whose defensive works were aimed inward, while he attacked from the outside. The Umayyad forces were mostly infantry, and what cavalry they had never got a chance to mobilize and meet him in open battle. As <a href="/wiki/Herman_of_Carinthia" title="Herman of Carinthia">Herman de Carinthia</a> wrote in one of his translations of a history of al-Andalus, Eudes managed a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers totally by surprise — and the result was a chaotic slaughter of the Muslim forces.</p>
<p>At <a href="/wiki/Bordeaux" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, and again at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Garonne" title="Battle of the River Garonne">Battle of the River Garonne</a>, the Umayyad forces were cavalry, not infantry, and were not taken by surprise, and given a chance to mass for battle, this led to the devastation of Eudes's army, almost all of whom were killed with minimal losses to the Muslims. Eudes's forces, like other European troops of that era, lacked <a href="/wiki/Stirrup" title="Stirrup">stirrups</a>, and therefore had no heavy cavalry. Virtually all of their troops were infantry. The Umayyad heavy cavalry broke the Christian infantry in their first charge, and then slaughtered them at will as they broke and ran.</p>
<p>The invading force went on to devastate southern Gaul. A possible motive, according to the second continuator of <a href="/wiki/Fredegar" title="Fredegar" class="mw-redirect">Fredegar</a>, was the riches of the <a href="/wiki/Abbey_of_Saint_Martin_of_Tours" title="Abbey of Saint Martin of Tours" class="mw-redirect">Abbey of Saint Martin of Tours</a>, the most prestigious and holiest <a href="/wiki/Shrine" title="Shrine">shrine</a> in Western Europe at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-Riche.2C_1993.2C_p._44_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Riche.2C_1993.2C_p._44-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Upon hearing this, <a href="/wiki/Austrasia" title="Austrasia">Austrasia</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_the_Palace" title="Mayor of the Palace">Mayor of the Palace</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Martel" title="Charles Martel">Charles Martel</a>, collected his army and marched south, avoiding the old Roman roads and hoping to take the Muslims by surprise. Because he intended to use a <a href="/wiki/Phalanx_formation" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx</a>, it was essential for him to choose the battlefield. His plan — to find a high wooded plain, form his men and force the Muslims to come to him — depended on the element of surprise.</p>

<p>From all accounts, the invading forces were caught entirely off guard to find a large force, well disposed and prepared for battle, with high ground, directly opposing their attack on Tours. Charles had achieved the total surprise he hoped for. He then chose to begin the battle in a defensive, <a href="/wiki/Phalanx_formation" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx</a>-like formation. According to the Arabian sources, the Franks drew up in a large square, with the trees and upward slope to break any cavalry charge.</p>
<p>For seven days, the two armies watched each other with minor skirmishes. The Umayyads waited for their full strength to arrive, which it did, but they were still uneasy. 'Abd-al-Raḥmân, despite being a good commander, had managed to let Charles bring his army to full strength and pick the location of the battle. Furthermore, it was difficult for the Umayyads to judge the size of the army opposing them, since Charles had used the trees and forest to make his force appear larger than it probably was. Thus, 'Abd-al-Raḥmân recalled all his troops, which did give him an even larger army — but it also gave Charles time for more of his veteran infantry to arrive from the outposts of his Empire. These infantry were all the hope for victory he had. Seasoned and battle hardened, most of them had fought with him for years, some as far back as 717. Further, he also had levies of militia arrive, but the militia was virtually worthless except for gathering food, and harassing the Muslims. Unlike his infantry, which was both experienced and disciplined, the levies were neither, and Charles had no intention of depending on them to stand firm against cavalry charges (Most historians through the centuries have believed the Franks were badly outnumbered at the onset of battle by at least 2-1.). Charles gambled everything that ‘Abd-al-Raḥmân would in the end feel compelled to battle, and to go on and loot Tours. Neither of them wanted to attack - but Abd-al-Raḥmân felt in the end obligated to sack Tours, which meant literally going through the Frankish army on the hill in front of him. Charles's decision to wait in the end proved crucial, as it forced the Umayyads to rush uphill, against the grade and the woods, which in and of themselves negated a large part of the natural advantages of a cavalry charge.</p>
<p>Charles had been preparing for this confrontation since Toulouse a decade before. He was well aware that if he failed, no other Christian force remained able to defend western Christianity. But Gibbon believes, as do most pre and modern historians, that Charles had made the best of a bad situation. Though outnumbered and depending on infantry, without heavy cavalry, Charles had a tough, battle-hardened heavy infantry who believed in him implicitly. Moreover, as Davis points out, this infantry was heavily armed, each man carrying up to perhaps 75 pounds of wood and iron armour into battle. Formed in a phalanx, they were better able to resist a cavalry charge than might be conventionally thought, especially as Charles had been able to secure them the high ground and trees to further aid breaking such charges. Charles also had the element of surprise, in addition to being allowed to pick the ground.</p>
<p>The Franks well dressed for the cold, and had the terrain advantage. The Arabs were not as prepared for the intense cold of an oncoming northern European winter, despite having tents, which the Franks did not, but did not want to attack a Frankish army they believed may have been numerically superior. Essentially, the Umayyads wanted the Franks to come out in the open, while the Franks, formed in a tightly packed defensive formation, wanted them to come uphill, into the trees, diminishing at once the advantages of their cavalry. It was a waiting game which Charles won: the fight began on the seventh day, as ‘Abd-al-Raḥmân did not want to postpone the battle indefinitely with winter approaching.</p>

<p>‘Abd-al-Raḥmân trusted the tactical superiority of his cavalry, and had them charge repeatedly. This time the faith the Umayyads had in their cavalry, armed with their long <a href="/wiki/Lance" title="Lance">lances</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sword" title="Sword">swords</a> which had brought them victory in previous battles, was not justified.</p>
<p>In one of the instances where <a href="/wiki/Medieval" title="Medieval" class="mw-redirect">medieval</a> <a href="/wiki/Infantry" title="Infantry">infantry</a> stood up against cavalry charges, the disciplined Frankish soldiers withstood the assaults, though according to Arab sources, the Arab cavalry several times broke into the interior of the Frankish square.

<p>Despite this, the Franks did not break. It appears that the years of year-round training that Charles had bought with Church funds, paid off. His hard-trained soldiery accomplished what was not thought possible at that time: infantry withstood the Umayyad heavy cavalry. Paul Davis says the core of Charles's army was a professional infantry which was both highly disciplined and well motivated, "having campaigned with him all over Europe," buttressed by levies that Charles basically used to raid and disrupt his enemy, and gather food for his infantry.<sup id="cite_ref-Davis_0-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davis-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The <i>Mozarabic Chronicle of 754</i> says:</p>

<p>Umayyad troops who had broken into the square had tried to kill Charles, but his <a href="/wiki/Feudalism" title="Feudalism">liege</a> men surrounded him and would not be broken. The battle was still in flux when—Frankish histories claim—a rumor went through the Umayyad army that Frankish scouts threatened the booty that they had taken from <a href="/wiki/Bordeaux" title="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>. Some of the Umayyad troops at once broke off the battle and returned to camp to secure their loot. According to Muslim accounts of the battle, in the midst of the fighting on the second day (Frankish accounts have the battle lasting one day only), scouts from the Franks sent by Charles began to raid the camp and supply train (including slaves and other plunder).</p>
<p>Charles supposedly had sent scouts to cause chaos in the Umayyad base camp, and free as many of the slaves as possible, hoping to draw off part of his foe. This succeeded, as many of the Umayyad cavalry returned to their camp. To the rest of the Muslim army, this appeared to be a full-scale retreat, and soon it became one. Both Western and Muslim histories agree that while trying to stop the retreat, ‘Abd-al-Raḥmân became surrounded, which led to his death, and the Umayyad troops then withdrew altogether to their camp. "All the host fled before the enemy", candidly wrote one Arabic source, "and many died in the flight". The Franks resumed their phalanx, and rested in place through the night, believing the battle would resume at dawn the following morning.</p>

<p>The next day, when the Umayyad forces did not renew the battle, the Franks feared an ambush. Charles at first believed that the Umayyad forces were trying to lure him down the hill and into the open. This tactic he knew he had to resist at all costs; he had in fact disciplined his troops for years to under no circumstances break formation and come out in the open. (See the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> for the results of infantry being lured into the open by armoured cavalry.) Only after extensive reconnaissance of the Umayyad camp by Frankish soldiers — which by both historical accounts had been so hastily abandoned that even the tents remained, as the Umayyad forces headed back to <a href="/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula" title="Iberian Peninsula">Iberia</a> with what loot remained that they could carry — was it discovered that the Muslims had retreated during the night.</p>

<p>While Abd ar-Rahman was pursuing Eudes, he decided to despoil Tours by destroying its palaces and burning its churches. There he confronted the consul of Austrasia by the name of Charles, a man who, having proved himself to be a warrior from his youth and an expert in things military, had been summoned by Eudes. After each side had tormented the other with raids for almost seven days, they finally prepared their battle lines and fought fiercely. The northern peoples remained as immobile as a wall, holding together like a glacier in the cold regions. In the blink of an eye, they annihilated the Arabs with the sword. The people of Austrasia, greater in number of soldiers and formidably armed, killed the king, Abd ar-Rahman, when they found him, striking him on the chest. But suddenly, within sight of the countless tents of the Arabs, the Franks despicably sheathed their swords postponing the fight until the next day since night had fallen during the battle. Rising from their own camp at dawn, the Europeans saw the tents and canopies of the Arabs all arranged just as they had appeared the day before. Not knowing that they were empty and thinking that inside them there were Saracen forces ready for battle, they sent officers to reconnoitre and discovered that all the Ishmaelite troops had left. They had indeed fled silently by night in tight formation, returning to their own country.</p>

<p>‘Abd-al-Raḥmân was a good general and should have done two things he failed to do. Gibbon makes the point that he did not move at once against Charles Martel, was surprised by him at Tours as Charles had marched over the mountains avoiding the roads to surprise the Muslim invaders, and thus the wily Charles selected the time and place they would collide:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Abd-al-Raḥmân either assumed that the Franks would not come to the aid of their Aquitanian rivals, or did not care, and he thus failed to assess their strength before invasion.</li>
<li>He failed to scout the movements of the <a href="/wiki/Frankish_Empire" title="Frankish Empire" class="mw-redirect">Frankish</a> army, and Charles Martel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having done either, he would have curtailed his lighthorse ravaging throughout lower Gaul, and marched at once with his full power against the Franks. This strategy would have nullified every advantage Charles had at Tours:</p>
<ul>
<li>The invaders would have not been burdened with booty that played such a huge role in the battle.</li>
<li>They would have not lost one warrior in the battles they fought before Tours. (Though they lost relatively few men in overrunning Aquitaine, they suffered some casualties — losses that may have been pivotal at Tours).</li>
<li>They would have bypassed weaker opponents such as Eudes, whom they could have picked off at will later, while moving at once to force battle with the real power in Europe, and at least partially picked the battlefield.</li>
</ul>
<p>While some military historians point out that leaving enemies in your rear is not generally wise, the Mongols proved that indirect attack, and bypassing weaker foes to eliminate the strongest first, is a devastatingly effective mode of invasion. In this case, those enemies were virtually no danger, given the ease with which the Muslims destroyed them. The real danger was Charles, and the failure to scout Gaul adequately was disastrous.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Edward_Shepherd_Creasy" title="Edward Shepherd Creasy">Creasy</a>, the Muslims' best strategic choice would have been to simply decline battle, depart with their loot, garrisoning the captured towns in southern Gaul, and return when they could force Charles to a battleground more to their liking, one that maximized the huge advantage they had in their mailed and armored horsemen. It might have been different, however, had the Muslim forces remained under control. Both western and Muslim histories agree the battle was hard fought, and that the Umayyad heavy cavalry had broken into the square, but agreed that the Franks were in formation still strongly resisting.</p>
<p>Charles could not afford to stand idly by while Frankish territories were threatened. He would have to face the Umayyad armies sooner or later, and his men were enraged by the utter devastation of the Aquitanians and wanted to fight. But Sir Edward Creasy noted that,</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">when we remember that Charles had no standing army, and the independent spirit of the Frank warriors who followed his standard, it seems most probable that it was not in his power to adopt the cautious policy of watching the invaders, and wearing out their strength by delay. So dreadful and so widespread were the ravages of the Saracenic light cavalry throughout Gaul, that it must have been impossible to restrain for any length of time the indignant ardor of the Franks. And, even, if Charles could have persuaded his men to look tamely on while the Arabs stormed more towns and desolated more districts, he could not have kept an army together when the usual period of a military expedition had expired.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></td>

<p>The Umayyad army retreated south over the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>. Charles continued to drive the Umayyad forces from France in subsequent years. After the death (c. 735) of Eudes, who had reluctantly acknowledged Charles' <a href="/wiki/Suzerainty" title="Suzerainty">suzerainty</a> in 719, Charles wished to unite Eudes's Duchy to himself, and went there to elicit the proper <a href="/wiki/Homage" title="Homage">homage</a> of the Aquitainians. But the nobility proclaimed Hunold, Eudes' son, as the Duke, and Charles recognized his legitimacy when the Umayyads entered <a href="/wiki/Provence" title="Provence">Provence</a> as part of an alliance with Duke <a href="/wiki/Maurontus" title="Maurontus">Maurontus</a> the next year.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> Hunold, who originally resisted acknowledging Charles as overlord, soon had little choice. He acknowledged Charles at once as his overlord, and Charles confirmed his Duchy, and the two prepared to confront the invaders. Charles believed it was vital to confine the Umayyad forces to <a href="/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula" title="Iberian Peninsula">Iberia</a> and deny them any foothold in Gaul, a view many historians share. Therefore he marched at once against the invaders, defeating one army outside <a href="/wiki/Arles" title="Arles">Arles</a>, which he took by storm and razed the city, and defeated the primary invasion force at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_River_Berre" title="Battle of the River Berre">Battle of the River Berre</a>, outside <a href="/wiki/Narbonne" title="Narbonne">Narbonne</a>.</p>

Alessandro Santosuosso strongly argues that the second (Umayyad) expedition was probably more dangerous than the first. The second expedition's failure put an end to any serious Muslim expedition across the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>, although raids continued. Plans for further large-scale attempts were hindered by internal turmoil in the Umayyad lands which often made enemies out of their own kind.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The historical views of this battle fall into three great phases, both in the East and especially in the West. Western historians, beginning with the Mozarabic Chronicle of 754, stressed the macrohistorical impact of the battle, as did the Continuations of Fredegar. This became a claim that Charles had literally saved Christianity, as Gibbon and his generation of historians agreed that the Battle of Tours was unquestionably decisive in world history.</p>
<p>Modern historians have essentially fallen into two camps on the issue. The first camp essentially agrees with Gibbon, and the other argues that the Battle has been massively overstated—turned from a raid in force to an invasion, and from a mere annoyance to the Caliph to a shattering defeat that helped end the Islamic Expansion Era. It is essential however, to note that within the first group, those who agree the Battle was of macrohistorical importance, there are a number of historians who take a more moderate and nuanced approach to supporting the battle's importance, rather than the more dramatic rhetoric of Gibbon. The best example of this school is <a href="/w/index.php?title=William_E._Watson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="William E. Watson (page does not exist)">William E. Watson</a>, who does believe the battle has such importance, as will be specifically discussed below, but analyzes it militarily, culturally and politically, rather than seeing it as a classic "Muslim versus Christian" confrontation.</p>
<p>In the East, Arab histories followed a similar path. First, the battle was regarded as a disastrous defeat, then it faded essentially from Arab histories, leading to a modern dispute which regards it as either a secondary loss to the great defeat of the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Constantinople_(718)" title="Siege of Constantinople (718)" class="mw-redirect">Second Siege of Constantinople</a> or a part of a series of great macrohistorical defeats which together brought about the fall of the first Caliphate. Essentially, many modern Muslim scholars argue that the first Caliphate was a jihadist state which could not withstand an end to its constant expansion. <a href="http://www.historyofjihad.org/france.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historyofjihad.org/france.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> With the Byzantines and Franks both successfully blocking further expansion, internal social troubles came to a head, starting with the Great <a href="/wiki/Berber_Revolt" title="Berber Revolt">Berber Revolt</a> of 740, and ending with the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Zab" title="Battle of the Zab">Battle of the Zab</a>, and the destruction of the Umayyad Caliphate.</p>

<p>The first wave of real "modern" historians, especially scholars on Rome and the medieval period, such as <a href="/wiki/Edward_Gibbon" title="Edward Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>, contended that had Charles fallen, the Umayyad Caliphate would have easily conquered a divided Europe.

<p>Eastern historians, like their Western counterparts, have not always agreed on the importance of the battle. According to <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Lewis" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, "The Arab historians, if they mention this engagement [the Battle of Tours] at all, present it as a minor skirmish,"<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Gustave_E._Von_Grunebaum" title="Gustave E.

<p>However, Creasy has claimed: "The enduring importance of the battle of Tours in the eyes of the Moslems is attested not only by the expressions of 'the deadly battle' and 'the disgraceful overthrow' which their writers constantly employ when referring to it, but also by the fact that no more serious attempts at conquest beyond the <a href="/wiki/Pyrenees" title="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> were made by the Saracens."</p>
<p>Thirteenth-century Moroccan author <a href="/wiki/Ibn_Idhari" title="Ibn Idhari">Ibn Idhari al-Marrakushi</a>, mentioned the battle in his history of the Maghrib, "<i><a href="/wiki/Al-Bayan_al-Mughrib" title="Al-Bayan al-Mughrib">al-Bayan al-Mughrib fi Akhbar al-Maghrib</a></i>." According to <a href="/wiki/Ibn_Idhari" title="Ibn Idhari">Ibn Idhari</a>, "Abd ar-Rahman and many of his men found martyrdom on the balat ash-Shuhada'i ("the path of the martyrs)." Antonio Santosuosso points out in his book <i>Barbarians, Marauders and Infidels: The Ways of Medieval Warfare,</i> on p. 126 "they (the Muslims) called the battle's location, the road between Poitiers and Tours, "the pavement of Martyrs." However, as <a href="/wiki/Henry_Copp%C3%A9e" title="Henry Coppée">Henry Coppée</a> has explained, "The same name was given to the battle of Toulouse and is applied to many other fields on which the Moslemah were defeated: they were always martyrs for the faith"<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Khalid_Yahya_Blankinship" title="Khalid Yahya Blankinship">Khalid Yahya Blankinship</a> argued that the military defeat at Tours was one of the failures that contributed to the decline of the Umayyad caliphate: "Stretching from Morocco to China, the Umayyad caliphate based its expansion and success on the doctrine of jihad--armed struggle to claim the whole earth for God's rule, a struggle that had brought much material success for a century but suddenly ground to a halt followed by the collapse of the ruling Umayyad dynasty in 750 AD. The End of the Jihad State demonstrates for the first time that the cause of this collapse came not just from internal conflict, as has been claimed, but from a number of external and concurrent factors that exceeded the caliphate's capacity to respond. These external factors began with crushing military defeats at Byzantium, Toulouse and Tours, which led to the Great Berber Revolt of 740 in Iberia and Northern Africa."</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">There is clearly some justification for ranking Tours-Poitiers among the most significant events in Frankish history when one considers the result of the battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle on the Rio Barbate in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian peninsula. The Reconquista, of course, was completed in 1492, only months before Columbus received official backing for his fateful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Had Charles Martel suffered at Tours-Poitiers the fate of King Roderick at the Rio Barbate, it is doubtful that a "do-nothing" sovereign of the Merovingian realm could have later succeeded where his talented major domus had failed. Indeed, as Charles was the progenitor of the Carolingian line of Frankish rulers and grandfather of Charlemagne, one can even say with a degree of certainty that the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had ‘Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup></td>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Although prudence needs to be exercised in minimizing or 'demythologizing' the significance of the event, it is no longer thought by anyone to have been crucial. The 'myth' of that particular military engagement survives today as a media cliché, than which nothing is harder to eradicate. It is well known how the propaganda put about by the Franks and the papacy glorified the victory that took place on the road between Tours and Poitiers...<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup></td>

<p>(See <a href="/wiki/Postmodernism" title="Postmodernism">postmodernism</a>.) In their introduction to <i>The Reader's Companion to Military History</i> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Cowley" title="Robert Cowley">Robert Cowley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Parker_(historian)" title="Geoffrey Parker (historian)">Geoffrey Parker</a> summarise this side of the modern view of the Battle of Tours by saying “The study of military history has undergone drastic changes in recent years. The old drums-and-bugles approach will no longer do. Factors such as economics, logistics, intelligence, and technology receive the attention once accorded solely to battles and campaigns and casualty counts. Words like "strategy" and "operations" have acquired meanings that might not have been recognizable a generation ago. Changing attitudes and new research have altered our views of what once seemed to matter most. For example, several of the battles that Edward Shepherd Creasy listed in his famous 1851 book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Fifteen_Decisive_Battles_of_the_World" title="The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World">The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World</a></i> rate hardly a mention here, and the confrontation between Muslims and Christians at Poitiers-Tours in 732, once considered a watershed event, has been downgraded to a raid in force."<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title=""><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>A number of modern historians and writers in other fields agree with Watson, and continue to maintain that this Battle was one of history's pivotal events. Professor of religion <a href="/wiki/Huston_Smith" title="Huston Smith">Huston Smith</a> says in <i>The World's Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions</i> "But for their defeat by Charles Martel in the Battle of Tours in 733, the entire Western world might today be Muslim." Historian <a href="/wiki/Pierre_Stephen_Robert_Payne" title="Pierre Stephen Robert Payne">Robert Payne</a> on page 142 in "<i>The History of Islam</i>" said "The more powerful Muslims and the spread of Islam were knocking on Europe’s door. And the spread of Islam was stopped along the road between the towns of Tours and Poitiers, France, with just its head in Europe."</p>
<p>Popular conservative military historian <a href="/wiki/Victor_Davis_Hanson" title="Victor Davis Hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a> shares his view about the battle's macrohistorical placement:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Recent scholars have suggested Poitiers, so poorly recorded in contemporary sources, was a mere raid and thus a construct of western mythmaking or that a Muslim victory might have been preferable to continued Frankish dominance. What is clear is that Poitiers marked a general continuance of the successful defense of Europe, (from the Muslims). Flush from the victory at Tours, Charles Martel went on to clear southern France from Islamic attackers for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into the foundations of the Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and reliable troops from local estates.".<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup></td>

<p>Paul Davis, another modern historian who addresses both sides in the debate over whether or not this Battle truly determined the direction of history, as Watson claims, or merely was a relatively minor raid, as Cardini writes, says "whether Charles Martel saved Europe for Christianity is a matter of some debate. What is sure, however, is that his victory ensured that the Franks would dominate Gaul for more than a century."<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> Davis writes, "Moslem defeat ended the Moslem’s threat to western Europe, and Frankish victory established the Franks as the dominant population in western Europe, establishing the dynasty that led to Charlemagne."<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64" title=""><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Anti-intellectualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Expression">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expression</span></h2>
<p>Anti-intellectualism will often be expressed within communities through declarations of <a href="/wiki/Other" title="Other">Otherness</a>, that is, intellectuals will be said to be 'not one of us'. Those who mistrust intellectuals will represent them as a danger to normality, insisting that they are outsiders with little empathy for the common people. This has historically resulted in intellectuals being painted as arrogant members of a different social grouping. In rural communities, for example, intellectuals may be viewed as "city slickers" who know little of the country and its ways. It is also common for communities to typecast intellectuals as foreigners or members of ethnic minorities, for instance as <a href="/wiki/Asians" title="Asians" class="mw-redirect">Asians</a>. Along with this, intellectuals will often be said to be prone to mental instability, their critics insisting there is a medically proven connection between <a href="/wiki/Genius" title="Genius">genius</a> and madness. Communities where religious <a href="/wiki/Faith" title="Faith">faith</a> is strong may endeavor to link intellectuals with the promotion of <a href="/wiki/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheism</a>, while the sexual mores of intellectuals can be also placed in doubt in some cultures where they can be suspected of high <a href="/wiki/Promiscuity" title="Promiscuity">promiscuity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Homophobia" title="Homophobia">homosexual</a> tendencies, or <a href="/wiki/Celibacy" title="Celibacy">lack of interest in sex at all</a>. Notably, those who disapprove of intellectuals often view them as exhibiting not one, but a combination of these character traits i.e. <a href="/wiki/Promiscuous" title="Promiscuous" class="mw-redirect">promiscuous</a> <a href="/wiki/Celibacy" title="Celibacy">celibacy</a>. Intellectuals find humor in such self-contradictions.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Anti-intellectualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Causes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Causes</span></h2>
<p>Anti-intellectual beliefs may come from a variety of sources. These include:</p>
<p><a name="Religion" id="Religion"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Anti-intellectualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Religion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>
<p>Although a variety of <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religions</a> promote intellectualism, there has also been a religious tendency in modern and classical times to harbor anti-intellectual sentiments<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since January 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. This occurs primarily in <a href="/wiki/Fundamentalism" title="Fundamentalism">fundamentalist</a> groups within religions who perceive one or more contradictions in specific religious tenets. As stated before, this rejection is not necessarily the case with all religious groups, as many religious groups pride themselves on their scholarly, as well as religious, traditions. In fact, many early and contemporary philosophers consider/considered themselves religious including <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" title="René Descartes">René Descartes</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, and others.</p>
<p>When religious <a href="/wiki/Doctrine" title="Doctrine">doctrines</a> include statements about <a href="/wiki/Natural_history" title="Natural history">natural</a> or human <a href="/wiki/History" title="History">history</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Provenance" title="Provenance">provenance</a> of <a href="/wiki/Sacred_text" title="Sacred text" class="mw-redirect">sacred texts</a> (and other matters), such claims may be investigated by external <a href="/wiki/Scholarship" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a>. For example a claim about the age of a <a href="/wiki/Turin_shroud" title="Turin shroud" class="mw-redirect">religious artifact</a> may be <a href="/wiki/Turin_shroud#Radiocarbon_dating" title="Turin shroud" class="mw-redirect">scientifically tested</a>, or a <a href="/wiki/Theodicy" title="Theodicy" class="mw-redirect">theodicy</a> may be logically examined. If such an investigation is instigated, the outcome may therefore create conflict in relation to how an adherent to the doctrine perceives it as confirming or denying their belief.</p>
<p>However, religious anti-intellectualism is not confined to hostility against science: When movements such as <a href="/wiki/Bohemianism" title="Bohemianism">bohemianism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Avant-gardism" title="Avant-gardism" class="mw-redirect">avant-gardism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">romanticism</a> become major factors in the fine arts, religious believers may perceive these trends to be subversive of <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">morality</a> and call for <a href="/wiki/Censorship" title="Censorship">censorship</a>. This has been a fairly common theme in socio-cultural trends in the Americas and Europe since the time of the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Reformation</a>. Some would argue, however, that this is just moral conservatism, which is distinct from anti-intellectualism, though the two positions are allied in many cases.</p>
<p><a name="Authoritarian_politics" id="Authoritarian_politics"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Anti-intellectualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Authoritarian politics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Authoritarian politics</span></h3>
<p>Anti-intellectualism is often used by <a href="/wiki/Dictators" title="Dictators" class="mw-redirect">dictators</a> or those seeking to establish <a href="/wiki/Dictatorships" title="Dictatorships" class="mw-redirect">dictatorships</a>. Educated people as a social group have often been seen by totalitarian elements as a threat because of the tendency of intellectuals to question existing social norms and to dissent from established opinion. Thus, often violent anti-intellectual backlashes are common during the rise and rule of authoritarian political movements, such as <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">Fascism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theocracy" title="Theocracy">Theocratic rule</a>. Moreover, because many intellectuals refuse to embrace <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>, they are also commonly portrayed as <a href="/wiki/Patriotism" title="Patriotism">unpatriotic</a> and subversive.</p>
<p>The most extreme dictatorships, such as that of the <a href="/wiki/Khmer_Rouge" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a>, simply murdered anyone with more than a rudimentary education. Other expressions of anti-intellectualism range from the closure of public libraries and places of learning, to keeping intellectuals and scientists isolated from the world in an "<a href="/wiki/Ivory_tower" title="Ivory tower" class="mw-redirect">ivory tower</a>", to official declarations that intellectuals are prone to mental illness and enacting laws to have them placed under psychiatric care. In addition, intellectuals in countries ruled by authoritarian governments are often subject to popular condemnation and used as scapegoats to divert the anger of the public away from those in power. Anti-intellectualism is not necessarily violent, however, and not necessarily oppressive. Anti-intellectual attitudes can be held by any group, including non-violent ones, as well as by individuals who merely disfavor intellectualism and learning in general. According to <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Majfud" title="Jorge Majfud">Jorge Majfud</a>, "this contempt that arises from a power installed in the social institutions and from the inferiority complex of its actors, is not a property of 'underdeveloped' countries. In fact, it is always the critical intellectuals, writers or artists who head the top-ten lists of the most stupid of the stupid in the country."<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Populism" id="Populism"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Anti-intellectualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Populism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Populism</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Populism" title="Populism">Populism</a> can be another major strain of anti-intellectualism. In this context, intellectuals are presented as <a href="/wiki/Elitism" title="Elitism">elitists</a> and tricksters whose knowledge and <a href="/wiki/Rhetoric" title="Rhetoric">rhetorical</a> skills are feared, not because they are useless, but because they may be used to hoodwink the ordinary people, who are conceived of as the 'salt of the earth' and the source of virtue. American former president <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> has been accused of appealing to this type of populism. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Those who argue from populist ideals will often assert that knowledge needs to be regulated by the people, claiming that educators need to work in line with policies made by <a href="/wiki/Stakeholder_(general)" title="Stakeholder (general)">stakeholders</a> such as parent groups.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the curiosity and objectivity of intellectuals about foreign countries and beliefs is portrayed as a lack of <a href="/wiki/Patriotism" title="Patriotism">patriotism</a> or <a href="/wiki/Moral_clarity" title="Moral clarity">moral clarity</a>, and intellectuals are often held to be suspect of holding dangerously foreign, possibly subversive, opinions. An extreme form was embodied by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Anti-Communism" title="Anti-Communism" class="mw-redirect">anti-Communist</a> <a href="/wiki/U.S._senator" title="U.S. senator" class="mw-redirect">senator</a> from <a href="/wiki/Wisconsin" title="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>.</p>

<p>The educational system may serve as a powerful tool for forming the culture of a nation. In the English speaking world, particularly in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the schools and universities have often been criticized for being overtaken by overtly 'Intellectualist' trends and hence not preparing the youth properly to be members of society who would be cultured, prepared for challenging jobs, and capable of independent thought.</p>

<p>A major preserve of real, though hardly militant or even self-aware, anti-intellectualism in the contemporary world is a youth subculture often associated with those students who are more interested in social life or athletics than in their studies. Such subcultures, often marked by <a href="/wiki/Cliques" title="Cliques" class="mw-redirect">cliques</a>, exist among students of all groups. Commercial <a href="/wiki/Youth_culture" title="Youth culture" class="mw-redirect">youth culture</a> also generates a dizzying variety of <a href="/wiki/Fad" title="Fad" class="mw-redirect">fads</a>. Keeping up with the trends is difficult, and their content is frequently criticised by cultural critics of many different persuasions for being simple-minded and pandering to unsophisticated appetites. Pursuing <a href="/wiki/Popularity" title="Popularity">popularity</a> has been likened by <a href="/wiki/Blog" title="Blog">blog</a> writer <a href="/wiki/Paul_Graham" title="Paul Graham">Paul Graham</a> to a full time job that leaves little time for intellectual interests.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the realm of <a href="/wiki/Higher_education" title="Higher education">higher education</a> concerns are generally threefold:</p>
<p><a name="Political_bias" id="Political_bias"></a></p>
<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Anti-intellectualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Political bias">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political bias</span></h5>
<p>One type of criticism is based upon the perception that university professors and other academics have increasingly inculcated their own political ideologies into pedagogical interactions and professional research at the cost of the quality, objectivity, and appropriateness of each. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> this claim is more often made by those individuals on the conservative side of the political spectrum against political <a href="/wiki/Liberals" title="Liberals" class="mw-redirect">liberals</a>, as understood in a contemporary sense of the term as well as <a href="/wiki/Radicalization" title="Radicalization" class="mw-redirect">radicals</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leftists" title="Leftists" class="mw-redirect">leftists</a>. Whether this focus on the proverbial "ivory tower left" is deserved is the subject of much intense debate both within the <a href="/wiki/Academy" title="Academy">Academy</a> and various political spheres.</p>
<p>Generally, these criticisms are brought up against persons working within the field of the <a href="/wiki/Humanities" title="Humanities">Humanities</a>-especially a set of the Humanities falling under the large subdivision of the <a href="/wiki/Social_Sciences" title="Social Sciences" class="mw-redirect">Social Sciences</a>. Among the fields most contested are <a href="/wiki/Women%27s_Studies" title="Women's Studies" class="mw-redirect">Women's Studies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cultural_Studies" title="Cultural Studies" class="mw-redirect">Cultural Studies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ethnic_Studies" title="Ethnic Studies" class="mw-redirect">Ethnic Studies</a> or <a href="/wiki/Race_relations" title="Race relations">Racial Studies</a>. Whether such field-specific attention is deserved is, once again, the subject of much intense debate.</p>
<p>When the criticism of political bias is set in the context of American <a href="/wiki/Liberals" title="Liberals" class="mw-redirect">liberals</a> vs. American <a href="/wiki/Conservatism" title="Conservatism">conservatives</a>, as it often is, the dialogue between the two sides can become rapidly polemical. One finds conservative critics called "anti-intellectuals" as they attempt to bring the charge of political bias against various liberals even as the accused liberals are charged with such things as "re-writing history" (<a href="/wiki/Historical_revisionism" title="Historical revisionism">Historical revisionism</a>); the validity of each party's assertion must be recognized to vary from case to case.</p>

<p>Another major concern centers on the perceived lack of general education in college curricula. Critics claim<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution.&#160;since November 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">who?</a></i>]</span></sup> , for example, that college students ought to take more <a href="/wiki/Humanities" title="Humanities">humanities</a> classes, such as history or literature, along with the requirements of their major. Notably, the <a href="/wiki/Humanities" title="Humanities">humanities</a> requirements in <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</a> colleges are actually much greater than in many other countries, such as <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> or <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> where <a href="/wiki/College" title="College">college</a> instruction is focused almost entirely on professional, often technical, preparation.</p>

<p>A third line of criticism, sometimes seeming to contradict the second, is the absence of 'real life' usefulness from the study of humanities. This has also contributed to anti-intellectualism, particularly among those who study, or have studied, <a href="/wiki/Technical" title="Technical">technical</a> subjects. This is sometimes considered more of a 'rival-intellectualism' rather than true anti-intellectualism, inasmuch as people who have received university-level technical training have themselves engaged in an intellectual activity of great complexity. This sort of antagonism is often exacerbated in universities when it comes to apportioning limited budgets and providing funding for professors and graduate students. While it is often more expensive to hire and fund technical and engineering departments (often due to demands for labs, resources, computers, etc.) a university's budget committee may see them as having greater practical importance over the liberal arts. Furthermore, grants and endowments to universities may come with stipulations requiring that the money go to programs that the benefactor views as useful.</p>

<p>19th century <a href="/wiki/Popular_culture" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> is important in the history of American anti-intellectualism.

<p>The 19th century predominantly valued the self-reliant and "self-made man," schooled by <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a> and by experience, over the <a href="/wiki/Intellectual" title="Intellectual">intellectual</a> whose learning was acquired through books and formal study. In 1843, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bayard_R._Hall&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bayard R. Hall (page does not exist)">Bayard R. Hall</a> wrote of frontier <a href="/wiki/Indiana" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>, that "(w)e always preferred an ignorant bad man to a talented one, and hence attempts were usually made to ruin the moral character of a smart candidate; since unhappily smartness and wickedness were supposed to be generally coupled, and incompetence and goodness." Still, there was a possibility for redemption if the "egghead" embraced common mores. A character of <a href="/wiki/O._Henry" title="O. Henry">O.

<p>The related stereotype of the slow-witted naïf with a heart of gold, popular in 19th century stage shows, appears still in American culture, recently in the 1985 novel and 1994 motion picture <i><a href="/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(film)" title="Forrest Gump (film)" class="mw-redirect">Forrest Gump</a></i>.</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>For most American intellectuals, the Communist movement of the 1930s was a crucial experience. In Europe, where the movement was at once more serious and more popular, it was still only one current in intellectual life; the Communists could never completely set the tone of thinking. . . . But in this country there was a time when virtually all intellectual vitality was derived in one way or another from the Communist party. If you were not somewhere within the party’s wide orbit, then you were likely to be in the opposition, which meant that much of your thought and energy had to be devoted to maintaining yourself in opposition.</i><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>A more recent variant on this tendency is the so-called "academic freedom" movement, led by <a href="/wiki/David_Horowitz" title="David Horowitz">David Horowitz</a> and his <a href="/wiki/David_Horowitz_Freedom_Center" title="David Horowitz Freedom Center">Center for the Study of Popular Culture</a>, which claims the identity politics and left-wing views of certain academics are a means of indoctrinating university students with anti-American views<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some modern American anti-intellectualism originates from the view held by some <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Christian" title="Conservative Christian" class="mw-redirect">conservative Christians</a> that the current form of public education subverts religious belief.

This has the effect of discrediting the idea of social change by associating it with hypocritical academics, thereby serving the status quo.</p>
<p>In return for their rhetorical services, so this theory goes, intellectuals are rewarded with the power to set themselves up as the social betters of the proletariat and are given a measure of control over how normal people live their lives.

Both the core of the <a href="/wiki/Communist" title="Communist" class="mw-redirect">Communist</a> Party and people who became local activists and officials in <a href="/wiki/Government" title="Government">government</a> and <a href="/wiki/Industry" title="Industry">industry</a> often lacked at least formal education and disdained those who had it. <a href="/wiki/Lenin" title="Lenin" class="mw-redirect">Lenin</a> once called the <a href="/wiki/Intelligentsia" title="Intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>, particularly those who opposed him, "rotten" and "shit".<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The boast, roughly translated as "we ain't completed no academies" ("мы академиев не кончали") became a byword for the new ruling <a href="/wiki/Elite" title="Elite">elite</a>. Former members of propertied classes were classified as <a href="/wiki/Lishentsy" title="Lishentsy" class="mw-redirect">Lishentsy</a> and their children were denied access to education. In 1922 a large group of Russian intellectuals was exiled on the so-called <a href="/wiki/Philosophers%27_ships" title="Philosophers' ships">Philosophers' ships</a>.</p>
<p>Later on, the Soviet government came to see education as important and dedicated great resources to literacy on the one hand, and higher and professional education on the other. However, as a matter of social policy, the government sought to promote the <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> over an intellectual elite. Accordingly, industrial workers often received greater salaries than university-trained professionals such as <a href="/wiki/Teacher" title="Teacher">teachers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Medical_doctor" title="Medical doctor" class="mw-redirect">doctors</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Engineer" title="Engineer">engineers</a>. Moreover, workers were covertly inculcated with the notion that only manual labor creates real value in the economy, whereas educated people just sit around writing papers.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since August 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>It must be stressed, however, that the anti-intellectualism of the Soviet political elite was closely associated with the fact that the Russian academic milieu, as a part of the tsarist state apparatus, had been hostile to the 1917 Bolshevik takeover almost by definition; however, when dealing with practical issues such as economic and scientific management, the early Soviet regime had to resort to such "bourgeois experts", therefore the tense relationship between the Communist Party elite and non-Party educated people. It was only during the early 1930s that <a href="/wiki/Stalin" title="Stalin" class="mw-redirect">Stalin</a> attempted to replace the old intelligentsia with a new, Party-approved group. Such favouring of <i>partinost</i> - that is to say, a partisan stance towards all matters intellectual - over formal scholarship, no matter how crude such partisan stance happened to be - in the end amounted to a clear anti-intellectual stance.</p>
<p>The Soviet treatment of certain sciences is an example of anti-intellectualism - the <a href="/wiki/Pseudoscience" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscientific</a> theories of <a href="/wiki/Lysenkoism" title="Lysenkoism">Lysenkoism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Japhetic_theory" title="Japhetic theory">Japhetic theory</a> gained prominence between the <a href="/wiki/1930s" title="1930s">1930s</a> and the <a href="/wiki/1950s" title="1950s">1950s</a> for political reasons rather than the normal scientific process. They caused significant damage to Soviet <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> and <a href="/wiki/Linguistics" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a> before they were abandoned in the 1950s.</p>

<p>Asian anti-intellectualism has deep roots. Even the <a href="/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching" title="Tao Te Ching">Tao Te Ching</a> advises rulers to keep their subjects with a "full belly and an empty mind" and that "ignorance is better than knowledge" among the people. Additionally, <a href="/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang" title="Qin Shi Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a>, the first emperor of China, even was one of the most prominent to show anti-intellectualism by distrusting scholars and forcing the educated into labor, and <a href="/wiki/Burning_of_books_and_burying_of_scholars" title="Burning of books and burying of scholars">burning texts</a> written by historians or by Confucian scholars.</p>
<p>A number of Asian countries have experienced degrees of anti-intellectualism in the 20th century.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Cambodia" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, a country where few people have access to formal education (the literacy rate is about 50% as of 2004), the <a href="/wiki/Khmer_Rouge" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> regime (1975–1979) was generally disdainful of intellectuals and saw many as enemies or traitors (see also: <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Kampuchea" title="Democratic Kampuchea">Democratic Kampuchea</a>). In some sectors, anyone who wore glasses was shot by Khmer guards, as glasses were seen as a mark of education and intellectualism.</p>
<p>The revolutionary regime in the newly established <a href="/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran" title="Islamic Republic of Iran" class="mw-redirect">Islamic Republic of Iran</a> also displayed a streak of anti-intellectualism in its policies. Besides the emigration of many well-educated, western-trained, intellectuals in the wake of the revolution (<a href="/wiki/Brain_drain" title="Brain drain">Brain drain</a>), the government decreed in 1980 that all universities are to be closed until the curricula are "purified" from the corrupt Pahlavi legacy. The ban on secular high education persisted until 1982. Also, the repressive attitude of the regime toward Iranian intelligentsia is well known (a highly publicized case of intellectual repression was the execution of the poet <a href="/w/index.php?title=Said_Soltanpour&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Said Soltanpour (page does not exist)">Said Soltanpour</a> in 1981).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Anti-intellectualism&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26" title="Edit section: Anti-intellectualism in Italy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-intellectualism in Italy</span></h2>
<p>A form of anti-intellectualism, which began as a philosophical perspective championed notably by <a href="/wiki/Giovanni_Gentile" title="Giovanni Gentile">Giovanni Gentile</a>'s rather intellectual &amp; epistemological rendering of Italian Fascism (and too being a form of the view adhered to by many Italian <a href="/wiki/Futurism" title="Futurism">Futurists</a>), displayed itself in a way that was quite distinct from the consideration of most other conceptions of anti-intellectualism as a position. This 'anti-intellectualism' of Gentile's was pro-erudition, and therefore in favor of the sciences, philosophy &amp; all quintessentially "intellectual" fields, including favoring positions of authority for thinkers, i.e. the thinker as a profession, and even sought &amp; struggled for them to be included in the social sphere as well. It was, however, how he construed the term "intellectual", which was to him to mean one who uses the intellect abstractly in the passive tense and who does not apply intellectual pursuits to active <a href="/wiki/Praxis_(process)" title="Praxis (process)">praxis</a>, that made his idea of anti-intellectualism fundamentally different from those who outright opposed the academics. Rather, Gentile was a pedagogue and academic himself who espoused others who were the same.</p>
<p>However the term "intellectualism" represented to Gentile an abhorrent support for objectifying ideas as they shouldn't be, in ways which fixed thought as object &amp; ceased to make intellect flourish but instead stagnate. Gentile saw a system of "concrete thinking" as something definitely of another quality than what was to him "abstract thought". This was something which he opposed as having no real connection to intelligence but rather saw a separation from active intelligence in it (by abstracting what are living processes of thinking and so labeling and killing them). This view was very much parallel to his philosophical system of <a href="/wiki/Actual_Idealism" title="Actual Idealism">Actual Idealism</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The reliance of logic on too many <i><a href="/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori" title="A priori and a posteriori">a posteriori</a></i> held principles external to the matter-at-hand was Gentile's criteria for (decadent) intellectualism. This left his philosophy as an intellectualized kind of <a href="/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a> toward intellectualism.</p>
<p>Giovanni Gentile summed up &amp; reiterated his strong support for erudite endeavors &amp; the use of study and literature as central to his ideals for how society should be composed, all the while opposing what he named "intellectualism" many times throughout his career, as for an example below:</p>

<p>This form of philosophical anti-intellectualism that Gentile posited became the mainstay of Fascist ideology which would later be taken and interpreted even by follow Fascist contemporaries in entirely different manners than held to in the original philosophy of Gentile.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman</a> statesman <a href="/wiki/Cato_the_Elder" title="Cato the Elder">Cato the Elder</a>'s public career displayed many traits that today would be considered anti-intellectual. He vehemently opposed the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> cultural ideals and models into the Roman republic, believing them to be subversive of traditional plainspokenness and rugged military values. He urged the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senate" title="Roman Senate">Roman Senate</a> to pass its decree against the newly imported <a href="/wiki/Bacchanalia" title="Bacchanalia">Bacchanalian</a> <a href="/wiki/Mystery_religion" title="Mystery religion">mysteries</a>, which it did in the <i>Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus</i> in 186 BC. He urged the deportation of three <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athenian</a> philosophers, <a href="/wiki/Carneades" title="Carneades">Carneades</a>, <a href="/wiki/Diogenes_the_Stoic" title="Diogenes the Stoic" class="mw-redirect">Diogenes the Stoic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Critolaus" title="Critolaus">Critolaus</a>, who had been sent to <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> as <a href="/wiki/Ambassador" title="Ambassador">ambassadors</a> from Athens, on the grounds that he believed the opinions they expressed were dangerous. The Emperor <a href="/wiki/Augustus" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> also exiled many philosophers.</p>
<p>However, rulers in the ancient and classical worlds were generally intolerant of anyone who disagreed with them. Anti-intellectualism as hostility by self-identified "common" people, or those that claim to speak for them, against a <i>perceived class</i> of cultural elites is generally considered a modern phenomenon.</p>

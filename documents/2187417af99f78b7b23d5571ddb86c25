<p><i><b>The Picture of Dorian Gray</b></i> is the only published <a href="/wiki/Novel" title="Novel">novel</a> written by <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, first appearing as the lead story in <i><a href="/wiki/Lippincott%27s_Monthly_Magazine" title="Lippincott's Monthly Magazine">Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</a></i> on 20 June 1890.<sup id="cite_ref-Penguin_Intro_pg_ix_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Penguin_Intro_pg_ix-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Wilde later revised this edition, making several alterations, and adding new chapters; the amended version was published by Ward, Lock, and Company in April 1891.<sup id="cite_ref-Publish_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Publish-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The story is often miscalled <i>The Portrait of Dorian Gray</i>.</p>
<p>The novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray, the subject of a painting by artist Basil Hallward. Basil is greatly impressed by Dorian's physical beauty and becomes strongly infatuated with him, believing that his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art. Talking in Basil's garden, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil's, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry's world view. Espousing a new kind of <a href="/wiki/Hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a>, Lord Henry suggests that the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and the fulfilment of the senses. Realizing that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian cries out, expressing his desire to sell his soul to ensure that the portrait Basil has painted of him would age rather than himself. Dorian's wish is fulfilled, subsequently plunging him into a series of debauched acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his <a href="/wiki/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a>, with each <a href="/wiki/Sin" title="Sin">sin</a> being displayed as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of aging.<sup id="cite_ref-gutenberg_20_1_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gutenberg_20_1-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The novel begins with Lord Henry Wotton, observing the artist Basil Hallward painting the portrait of a very handsome young man named Dorian Gray. Dorian arrives later, meeting Wotton. After hearing Lord Henry's world view, Dorian begins to think that beauty is the only worthwhile aspect of life, and the only thing left to pursue. He wishes that the portrait of himself, which Basil is painting, would grow old in his place. Under the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian begins an exploration of his senses. He discovers an actress, Sibyl Vane, who performs <a href="/wiki/Shakespeare" title="Shakespeare" class="mw-redirect">Shakespeare</a> in a dingy theatre. Dorian approaches her, and soon proposes marriage. Sibyl, who refers to him as "Prince Charming," rushes home to tell her skeptical mother and brother. Her protective brother, James, tells her that if "Prince Charming" ever harms her, he will kill him.</p>
<p>Dorian then invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in <i><a href="/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i>. Sibyl, whose only previous knowledge of love was through the love of theatre, suddenly loses her acting abilities through the experience of true love with Dorian, and performs very badly. Dorian rejects her, saying that her beauty was in her art, and if she could no longer act, he was no longer interested in her. When he returns home, Dorian notices that Basil's portrait of him has changed. After examining the painting, Dorian realizes that his wish has come true - the portrait's expression now bears a subtle sneer, and will age with each sin he commits, while his own outward appearance remains unchanged. He decides to reconcile with Sibyl, but Lord Henry arrives in the morning to say that Sibyl has killed herself by swallowing <a href="/wiki/Prussic_acid" title="Prussic acid" class="mw-redirect">prussic acid</a> (hydrogen cyanide). Over the next eighteen years, Dorian experiments with every vice, mostly under the influence of a "poisonous" French novel, a present from Lord Henry. Wilde never reveals the title but his inspiration was possibly drawn from <a href="/wiki/Joris-Karl_Huysmans" title="Joris-Karl Huysmans">Joris-Karl Huysmans</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/%C3%80_rebours" title="À rebours">À rebours</a></i> (<i>Against Nature</i>) due to the likenesses that exist between the two novels.<sup id="cite_ref-A_Rebours_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-A_Rebours-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>One night, before he leaves for Paris, Basil arrives to question Dorian about the rumours of his indulgences. Dorian does not deny his debauchery. He takes Basil to the portrait, which is revealed to have become as hideous as Dorian's sins. In a fit of anger, Dorian blames the artist for his fate, and stabs Basil to death. He then blackmails an old friend named Alan Campbell, who is a chemist, into destroying Basil's body. Wishing to escape his crime, Dorian travels to an <a href="/wiki/Opium_den" title="Opium den">opium den</a>. James Vane is nearby, and hears someone refer to Dorian as "Prince Charming." He follows Dorian outside and attempts to shoot him, but he is deceived when Dorian asks James to look at him in the light, saying that he is too young to have been involved with Sibyl eighteen years ago. James releases Dorian, but is approached by a woman from the opium den, who chastises him for not killing Dorian and tells him that Dorian has not aged for the past eighteen years.</p>
<p>While at dinner one night, Dorian sees Sibyl Vane's brother stalking the grounds and fears for his life. However, during a game-shooting party a few days later, James is accidentally shot and killed by one of the hunters. After returning to London, Dorian informs Lord Henry that he will be good from now on, and has started by not breaking the heart of his latest innocent conquest, a vicar's daughter in a country town, named Hetty Merton. At his apartment, Dorian wonders if the portrait has begun to change back, losing its senile, sinful appearance, now that he has changed his immoral ways. He unveils the portrait to find that it has become worse. Seeing this, he begins to question the motives behind his act of "mercy," whether it was merely vanity, curiosity, or the quest for new emotional excess. Deciding that only a full <a href="/wiki/Confession" title="Confession">confession</a> would truly <a href="/wiki/Absolve" title="Absolve" class="mw-redirect">absolve</a> him, but lacking any feelings of guilt and fearing the consequences, he decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience. In a fit of rage, he picks up the knife that killed Basil Hallward, and plunges it into the painting. His servants hear a cry from inside the locked room and send for the police. They find Dorian's body, stabbed in the heart and suddenly aged, withered and horrible, beside the portrait, which has reverted to its original form; it is only through the rings on his hand that the corpse can be identified.</p>

<p>In a letter, Wilde stated that the main characters of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> are in different ways reflections of himself: "Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps."<sup id="cite_ref-The_Modern_Library_Gray_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-The_Modern_Library_Gray-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Aestheticism" title="Aestheticism">Aestheticism</a> is a strong motif in the novel, and is tied in with the concept of the <a href="/wiki/Double_life" title="Double life" class="mw-redirect">double life</a>. A major theme is that Aestheticism is merely an absurd abstract that only serves to disillusion rather than dignify the concept of beauty. Although Dorian is <a href="/wiki/Hedonist" title="Hedonist" class="mw-redirect">hedonistic</a>, when Basil accuses him of making Lord Henry's sister's name a "by-word," Dorian replies "Take care, Basil. You go too far"<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> suggesting that Dorian still cares about his outward image and standing within <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> society. Wilde highlights Dorian's pleasure of living a double life,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Not only does Dorian enjoy this sensation in private, but he also feels "keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life" when attending a society gathering just 24 hours after committing a murder.</p>
<p>This duplicity and indulgence is most evident in Dorian's visits to the opium dens of London. <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" title="Oscar Wilde">Wilde</a> conflates the images of the upper class and lower class by having the supposedly upright Dorian visit the impoverished districts of London. Lord Henry asserts that "crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders...I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations", which suggests that Dorian is both the criminal and the <a href="/wiki/Aesthete" title="Aesthete" class="mw-redirect">aesthete</a> combined in one man. This is perhaps linked to <a href="/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson" title="Robert Louis Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde" title="Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde">Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</a>,</i> which Wilde admired.<sup id="cite_ref-Penguin_Intro_pg_ix_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Penguin_Intro_pg_ix-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The division that was witnessed in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, although extreme, is evident in Dorian Gray, who attempts to contain the two divergent parts of his personality. This is a recurring theme in many of the Gothic novels of which <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is one of the last.</p>

<p>The name "Dorian" has connotations of the <a href="/wiki/Dorians" title="Dorians">Dorians</a>, an ancient Greek tribe. Robert Mighall suggests that this could be Wilde hinting at a connection to "<a href="/wiki/Greek_love" title="Greek love">greek</a>", a euphemism for the <a href="/wiki/Homoeroticism" title="Homoeroticism">homoeroticism</a> that was accepted as everyday in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>. Indeed, Dorian is described using the <a href="/wiki/Semantic_field" title="Semantic field">semantic field</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Greek_Gods" title="Greek Gods" class="mw-redirect">Greek Gods</a>, being likened to <a href="/wiki/Adonis" title="Adonis">Adonis</a>, a person who looks as if "he were made of ivory and rose-leaves." However, Wilde does not mention any homosexual acts explicitly, and descriptions of Dorian's "<a href="/wiki/Sins" title="Sins" class="mw-redirect">sins</a>" are often vague, although there does appear to be an element of homoeroticism in the competition between Lord Henry and Basil, both of whom compete for Dorian's attention. Both of them make comments about Dorian in praise of his good looks and youthful demeanour, Basil going as far to say that "as long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me."<sup id="cite_ref-DorianGray_Chapter_I_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DorianGray_Chapter_I-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> However, while Basil is shunned, Dorian wishes to emulate Lord Henry, which in turn, rouses Lord Henry from his "characteristic languor to a desire to influence Dorian, a process that is itself a sublimated expression of <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-glbtq_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-glbtq-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Since the only person Dorian claims to have loved is a woman, Sibyl Vane, it is also possible Wilde intended his character to display Greek <a href="/wiki/Pansexuality" title="Pansexuality">pansexuality</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since September 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>The later corruption of Dorian seems to make what was once a boyish charm become a destructive influence. Basil asks why Dorian's "friendship is so fatal to young men", commenting upon the "shame and sorrow" that the father of one of the disgraced boys displays. Dorian only destroys these men when he becomes "intimate" with them, suggesting that the friendships between Dorian and the men in question become more than simply <a href="/wiki/Platonic" title="Platonic">platonic</a>. The shame associated with these relationships is bipartite: the families of the boys are upset that their sons may have indulged in a homosexual relationship with Dorian Gray, and also feel shame that they have now lost their place in society, their names having been sullied. Moreover, Alan Campbell is blackmailed by Dorian with the threat that the 'secret' held between them will be revealed. The loss of status is encapsulated in Basil's questioning of Dorian: speaking of the Duke of Perth, a disgraced friend of Dorian's, he asks "what gentleman would associate with him?"<sup id="cite_ref-DorianGray_Chapter_XII_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DorianGray_Chapter_XII-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The novel is considered groundbreaking in the context that, in literature, "Dorian Gray was one of the first in a long list of <a href="/wiki/Hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonistic</a> fellows whose homosexual tendencies secured a terrible fate."<sup id="cite_ref-Meloy_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Meloy-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Glaucon and Adeimantus present the myth of <a href="/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges" title="Ring of Gyges">Gyges' ring</a>, by which Gyges made himself invisible. They ask Socrates, if one came into possession of such a ring, why should he act justly? Socrates replies that even if no one can see one's physical appearance, the soul is disfigured by the evils one commits. This disfigured (the antithesis of beautiful) and corrupt soul is imbalanced and disordered, and in itself undesirable regardless of other advantages of acting unjustly. Dorian Gray's portrait is the means by which other individuals, such as Dorian's friend Basil, shortly before Dorian kills him, may see Dorian's distorted soul. The portrait is also akin to Gyges' ring: for by making Dorian eternally youthful and innocent in appearance, he may commit crimes with impunity.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since September 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

Tannhäuser becomes dissatisfied with his life there, however, and elects to return to the harsh world of reality, where, after taking part in a song-contest, he is sternly censured for his sensuality, and eventually dies in his search for repentance and the love of a good woman. It might even be argued that the end of the opera, in which a miracle announces the salvation of Tannhäuser's soul, suggests, perhaps, a more optimistic interpretation of Dorian's end than might otherwise be thought of.</p>

<p>Wilde himself stated that "in every first novel the hero is the author as <a href="/wiki/Christ" title="Christ">Christ</a> or Faust." As in <a href="/wiki/Faust" title="Faust">Faust</a>, a temptation is placed before the lead character Dorian, the potential for ageless beauty; Dorian indulges in this temptation. In both stories, the lead character entices a beautiful woman to love them and kills not only her, but also that woman's brother, who seeks revenge.<sup id="cite_ref-Faust_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Faust-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Wilde went on to say that the notion behind <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is "old in the history of literature" but was something to which he had "given a new form".<sup id="cite_ref-DorianGray_Preface_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DorianGray_Preface-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Unlike Faust, there is no point at which Dorian makes a deal with the <a href="/wiki/Devil" title="Devil">devil</a>. However, Lord Henry's <a href="/wiki/Cynic" title="Cynic">cynical</a> outlook on life, and <a href="/wiki/Hedonistic" title="Hedonistic" class="mw-redirect">hedonistic</a> nature seems to be in keeping with the idea of the devil's role, that of the temptation of the <a href="/wiki/Purity" title="Purity">pure</a> and <a href="/wiki/Innocent" title="Innocent" class="mw-redirect">innocent</a>, qualities which Dorian exemplifies at the beginning of the book. Although Lord Henry takes an interest in Dorian, it does not seem that he is aware of the effect of his actions.

</div>
<p><i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> began as a short novel submitted to <a href="/wiki/Lippincott%27s_Monthly_Magazine" title="Lippincott's Monthly Magazine">Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</a>. In 1889, J. M. Stoddart, a proprietor for Lippincott, was in London to solicit short novels for the magazine. Wilde submitted the first version of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, which was published on 20 June 1890 in the July edition of Lippincott's. There was a delay in getting Wilde's work to press while numerous changes were made to the manuscripts of the novel (some of which survive to this day). Some of these changes were made at Wilde's instigation, and some at Stoddart's. Wilde removed all references to the fictitious book "Le Secret de Raoul", and to its fictitious author, Catulle Sarrazin. The book and its author are still referred to in the published versions of the novel, but are unnamed.</p>
<p>Wilde also attempted to moderate some of the more <a href="/wiki/Homoerotic" title="Homoerotic" class="mw-redirect">homoerotic</a> instances in the book, or instances whereby the intentions of the characters may be misconstrued. In the 1890 edition, Basil tells Henry how he "worships" Dorian, and begs him not to "take away the one person that makes my life absolutely lovely to me." The focus for Basil in the 1890 edition seems to be more towards love, whereas the Basil of the 1891 edition cares more for his art, saying "the one person who gives my art whatever charm it may possess: my life as an artist depends on him." The book was also extended greatly: the original thirteen chapters became twenty, and the final chapter was divided into two new chapters. The additions involved the "fleshing out of Dorian as a character" and also provided details about his ancestry, which helped to make his "psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing."<sup id="cite_ref-DorianGray_ANoteOnTheText_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DorianGray_ANoteOnTheText-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>The character of James Vane was also introduced, which helped to elaborate upon Sibyl Vane's character and background; the addition of the character helped to emphasise and foreshadow Dorian's selfish ways, as James foresees Dorian's character, and guesses upon his future dishonourable actions (the inclusion of James Vane's sub-plot also gives the novel a more typically Victorian tinge, part of Wilde's attempts to decrease the controversy surrounding the book). Another notable change is that, in the latter half of the novel, events were specified as taking place around Dorian Gray's 32nd birthday, on 7 November. After the changes, they were specified as taking place around Dorian Gray's 38th birthday, on 9 November, thereby extending the period of time over which the story occurs. The former date is also significant in that it coincides with the year in Wilde's life during which he was introduced to homosexual practices.</p>

<p>Overall, initial critical reception of the book was poor, with the book gaining "certain notoriety for being 'mawkish and nauseous,' 'unclean,' 'effeminate,' and 'contaminating.'"<sup id="cite_ref-The_Modern_Library_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-The_Modern_Library-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> This had much to do with the novel's <a href="/wiki/Homoeroticism" title="Homoeroticism">homoerotic</a> overtones, which caused something of a sensation amongst Victorian critics when first published. A large portion of the criticism was levelled at Wilde's perceived <a href="/wiki/Hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonism</a>, and its distorted views of conventional morality. The <i>Daily Chronicle</i> of 30 June 1890 suggests that Wilde's novel contains "one element...which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it."

<li>(Basil about Dorian) <i>He has stood as Paris in dainty armor, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms, he has sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, looking into the green, turbid Nile. He has leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland, and seen in the water's silent silver the wonder of his own beauty.</i> (This passage turns up in Basil's speech to Dorian in the 1891 version.)</li>
<li>(Lord Henry about fidelity) <i>It has nothing to do with our own will. It is either an unfortunate accident, or an unpleasant result of temperament.</i></li>
<li><i>"You don't mean to say that Basil has got any passion or any romance in him?" / "I don't know whether he has any passion, but he certainly has romance," said Lord Henry, with an amused look in his eyes. / "Has he never let you know that?" / "Never. I must ask him about it. I am rather surprised to hear it.</i></li>
<li>(describing Basil Hallward) <i>Rugged and straightforward as he was, there was something in his nature that was purely feminine in its tenderness.</i></li>
<li>(Basil to Dorian) <i>It is quite true that I have worshipped you with far more romance of feeling than a man usually gives to a friend. Somehow, I had never loved a woman. I suppose I never had time. Perhaps, as Harry says, a really</i> grande passion <i>is the privilege of those who have nothing to do, and that is the use of the idle classes in a country.</i> (the latter remark being part of Lord Henry's dialogue in the 1891 version)</li>
<li>Some dialogue between Mrs Leaf and Dorian has been cut, which mentions Dorian's fondness for "jam" (which might have been used metaphorically for his sexuality).</li>
<li>When Basil confronts Dorian: <i>Dorian, Dorian, your reputation is infamous. I know you and Harry are great friends.

<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a>, the most notable adaptation was <a href="/wiki/Albert_Lewin" title="Albert Lewin">Albert Lewin</a>'s 1945 film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray_(1945_film)" title="The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945 film)">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BBC-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> which won an <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a> for "Best Cinematography, Black-and-White".

The female Dorian Gray is an aspiring actress who sells her soul in exchange for eternal youth. The aging portrait in the original version is replaced by a film reel, with Dorian aging each time the film is watched.

<li>Dorian Gray was mentioned in the chorus of the song "Tears and Rain" by singer/songwriter <a href="/wiki/James_Blunt" title="James Blunt">James Blunt</a>. The lyrics used in the refrain, "Run far far away, find comfort in pain, all pleasure's the same it just keeps me from trouble. Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray, I've heard what they say but I'm not here for trouble. It's more than just words, it's just tears and rain" has been understood to be the pop star's profession of his awareness of the futility of his habit of seeking refuge in <a href="/wiki/Hedonistic" title="Hedonistic" class="mw-redirect">hedonistic</a> lifestyles, yet being unable to find a recourse to any other satisfying alternatives. The despairing quality that characterizes Dorian's self destructive belief that his depravity has placed him beyond <a href="/wiki/Salvation" title="Salvation">salvation</a> can be identified within this <a href="/wiki/Melancholic" title="Melancholic" class="mw-redirect">melancholic</a> ballad.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Faust" title="Faust">Faustian</a> theme of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> has also made it a popular choice for television, being adapted for use as a storyline for episodes in some <a href="/wiki/Television_series" title="Television series" class="mw-redirect">television series</a>':
<ul>
<li>The theme of being able to remain young forever was used in the British <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> TV show <i><a href="/wiki/Blake%27s_7" title="Blake's 7">Blake's 7</a></i> in the episode <i>Rescue</i> which debuted season 4. In it a character named Dorian forces others to absorb his physical and mental defects via a monster he holds in a cave far beneath the surface of the planet Xenon. When the creature is killed, Dorian dies a horrific death.</li>
<li><i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i> also used the novel as inspiration for its 129th episode <i><a href="/wiki/Man_of_the_People_(TNG_episode)" title="Man of the People (TNG episode)">Man of the People</a></i>. In the episode, an Ambassador Ves Alkar uses women as an object to which all of his negative aspects can be channelled. This results in the women's dispositions changing, each becoming more and more irritable. They also begin to age much more quickly, until they "burn out" and die. Deanna Troi becomes a near victim, until a plan is created to cause Ves Alkar to receive all of the emotions he has channelled away from himself. When this occurs, he rapidly ages and dies from his own emotions, much in the same way Dorian Gray does after confronting his portrait at the end of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i></li>
<li>The <i><a href="/wiki/Get_smart" title="Get smart" class="mw-redirect">Get smart</a></i> episode "Age Before Duty" featured a <i><a href="/wiki/KAOS_(Get_Smart)" title="KAOS (Get Smart)" class="mw-redirect">KAOS</a></i> plot to kill all the <i><a href="/wiki/CONTROL" title="CONTROL" class="mw-redirect">C.O.N.T.R.O.L.</a></i> agents with old age by painting wrinkles and gray hair on their photographs with a special "Dorian Gray Paint". The episode first aired December 5, 1969.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An operatic version of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> was staged by <a href="/wiki/Lowell_Liebermann" title="Lowell Liebermann">Lowell Liebermann</a>. Liebermann wanted to base a play on <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> because "the book made an impression on [him] as no other book has yet done".<sup id="cite_ref-Liebermann.2F_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Liebermann.2F-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> Premiered at the <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo_Opera" title="Monte Carlo Opera" class="mw-redirect">Monte Carlo Opera</a> in 1996,<sup id="cite_ref-Liebermann_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Liebermann-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Liebermann put a lot of emphasis on the <a href="/wiki/Musical_score" title="Musical score" class="mw-redirect">musical score</a> of the play, saying:</li>

<p>The entire opera is based on a twelve-note row which is used not serially, but tonally. It is first heard at the beginning of the opera in pizzicato cellos and basses. It is harmonised as Dorian's theme and then as the painting theme. As the painting disintegrates and becomes corrupted, so does its theme. The twelve consecutive scenes of the opera occur in the keys of the consecutive pitches of the note-row. In this manner the entire opera becomes one grand passacaglia, a variation of Dorian's theme, a picture of the picture---the tonal structure generated by a non-tonal device, a further metaphor for the form/content divide that generates the novel's dramatic structure.</p>

<li>A musical adaptation of the book by young theatre company Kangaroo Court is currently enjoying a successful run at the Tabard theatre, Chiswick (22nd Oct 2008 - 15th Nov 2008) Cast members include Nick Thompson, David Templeman, Megan Pugh and Gary Richens.

Made virtually immortal by the portrait, Collins, a man born in 1870, turned up at his ancestral home one hundred years later using the pseudonym Grant Douglas, the initials of which (though reversed, perhaps so as to avoid being too obvious) may be a nod to the character of Dorian Gray. ABC also presented an adaptation of <i>Dorian Gray</i> itself as a 1973 entry in its <i><a href="/wiki/ABC_Movie_of_the_Week" title="ABC Movie of the Week">Movie of the Week</a></i> series directed by <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Jordan" title="Glenn Jordan">Glenn Jordan</a>, produced by <a href="/wiki/Dan_Curtis" title="Dan Curtis">Dan Curtis</a> (the creator and producer of <i>Dark Shadows</i>) and starring <a href="/wiki/Shane_Briant" title="Shane Briant">Shane Briant</a>.</li>

Bourne brings the homoeroticism of the novel to the forefront by switching the genders of two of the principals: Lord Henry Wotton is now Lady H, publisher of a fashion magazine; and most significantly, Sybil Vane has become ballet dancer Cyril Vane, whom Gray falls for after watching a performance of Prokofiev's Romeo &amp; Juliet ballet.</li>

<p>After Fritz disbanded in 1972, Nicks and Buckingham, continued to write and record as a duo, producing demo tapes at Buckingham's father Morris's coffee plant.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> They secured a deal with <a href="/wiki/Polydor_Records" title="Polydor Records">Polydor Records</a>.</p>

The album was not a commercial success, despite the live shows that Nicks and Buckingham performed together to support it, and Polydor dropped them. To support herself and Buckingham, who wrote music and waited tables while recovering from <a href="/wiki/Infectious_mononucleosis" title="Infectious mononucleosis">mononucleosis</a>, Nicks worked a variety of jobs, which included waiting tables and a stint cleaning engineer/producer <a href="/wiki/Keith_Olsen" title="Keith Olsen">Keith Olsen</a>'s house, where Nicks and Buckingham lived for a time.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Nicks and Buckingham briefly relocated to Aspen, Colorado.

Nicks's signature "Rhiannon" reached #11. The album also included "Landslide", a popular radio item which would only grow in stature over the years.

<p>By 1978, Nicks became concerned with an increasing backlog of songs, dating back to her Buckingham Nicks days, that she was unable to record and release with Fleetwood Mac because of the constraint of having to accommodate three songwriters on each album. During <i>Tusk</i> sessions in 1979, Nicks began laying down early demos for a solo album. During the exhausting year-long world tour for the album, in 1979–80, she continued to write and gather material for a new project outside <a href="/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>. With <a href="/wiki/Danny_Goldberg" title="Danny Goldberg">Danny Goldberg</a> and Paul Fishkin, Nicks founded <a href="/wiki/Modern_Records" title="Modern Records">Modern Records</a>, a vehicle to record and release her own material. Between <i>Tusk</i> sessions, Nicks recorded two duets that became hits: with <a href="/wiki/Kenny_Loggins" title="Kenny Loggins">Kenny Loggins</a> on "Whenever I Call You Friend" (1978), and with <a href="/wiki/John_Stewart_(musician)" title="John Stewart (musician)">John Stewart</a> on "Gold" (1979).</p>

Nicks's "Storms" and "Beautiful Child" were speculated to be about her affair with Mick Fleetwood, while the Billboard Hot 100 #7 hit "Sara" alluded to her relationships with Fleetwood and Pesnell. Nicks hinted at the sound of her future solo projects<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may be based upon unreliable original research&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research?</a></i>]</span></sup> in "<a href="/wiki/Angel_(Fleetwood_Mac_song)" title="Angel (Fleetwood Mac song)">Angel</a>" and "Sisters of the Moon", (which reached a disappointing #86 on the Billboard Hot 100) about her hectic touring schedule being handled by Pesnell at the time. Nicks also recorded "The Dealer", but it was shelved.</p>
<p>Following the release of <i>Tusk</i>, Mick Fleetwood left his wife for Nicks's best friend Sara Recor, adding to tension between the bandmates. During the tour for Tusk, in March 1980, Lindsey Buckingham mocked Nicks on stage and kicked her. When interviewed about it later, Buckingham was unable to remember his actions, but did not deny that it could have happened.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Nicks ended her relationship with Henley at the beginning of the tour, but her relationship continued with Pesnell until the end of the concert tour.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>Nicks released <i><a href="/wiki/Bella_Donna_(album)" title="Bella Donna (album)">Bella Donna</a></i> on July 27, 1981, and it reached #1 on the Billboard 200 in September. As of 1990 it was certified four times platinum. All four of its singles charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's ten tracks included five songs written in previous years, and five new songs. Several unreleased songs from the <i>Bella Donna</i> sessions were included on soundtracks, in concert sets, and later Fleetwood Mac albums. Other tracks remain unreleased.</p>
<p><i>Bella Donna</i> was the first album to feature Nicks's back-up singers, Sharon Celani and Lori Perry. Nicks met Perry in the mid-1970s while working with her then-husband, producer Gordon Perry. Nicks befriended Perry after inviting her to contribute back-up vocals for the tracks she was working on. During a trip to <a href="/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, Nicks visited a club where Celani was performing and joined her on stage during a rendition of "Poor Pitiful Me". Celani later accepted Nicks's invitation to join her forthcoming solo project. Sharon Celani and Lori Perry-Nicks, who is married to Nicks's brother Christopher, have contributed vocals to all of Nicks's solo albums since then.</p>
<p>During the short, successful White Winged Dove tour, Nicks performed Fleetwood Mac songs, tracks from Bella Donna, and unreleased tracks like "Gold and Braid", "Blue Lamp", and Petty's "I Need to Know" (Nicks would later release "Blue Lamp" on the <a href="/wiki/Heavy_Metal_(film)" title="Heavy Metal (film)">Heavy Metal</a> movie soundtrack). Nicks's December 12 and December 13, 1981 performances at the Fox Wilshire Theatre in Beverly Hills, California were filmed for a one-hour video and laserdisc entitled <i>Stevie Nicks In Concert</i>, or <i>White Winged Dove</i> in Australia and other markets. The concert also aired on HBO. The concerts featured <a href="/wiki/Waddy_Wachtel" title="Waddy Wachtel">Waddy Wachtel</a> on guitar, Roy Bittan on piano, Benmont Tench on organ, and <a href="/wiki/Russ_Kunkel" title="Russ Kunkel">Russ Kunkel</a> on drums. Nicks had to cut this tour short to record the <i><a href="/wiki/Mirage_(Fleetwood_Mac_album)" title="Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)">Mirage</a></i> album with Fleetwood Mac.</p>
<p>For <i><a href="/wiki/Mirage_(Fleetwood_Mac_album)" title="Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)">Mirage</a></i>, Nicks contributed the track "Gypsy", a song originally tested for <i>Bella Donna</i>, which became one of the album's hit singles. "Gypsy" would reach #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also would receive wide attention and awards for the elaborate video. Nicks's other tracks included "That's Alright", written during the Buckingham Nicks era, and a new track entitled "Straight Back". The short <i>Mirage</i> tour took place between September and October 1982, and included Nicks's performance of "Sisters of the Moon", her 1979 <i>Tusk</i> album track and concert encore. After the tour, Nicks prepared to record her second solo album.</p>
<p>The day that Bella Donna reached #1 on the Billboard 200, Nicks's best friend since the age of 15, Robin Anderson, was diagnosed with leukemia. Robin managed to give birth to a son, appointing Nicks as the child's godmother. Sadly, Robin had died just six months before doctors found the medical research which could save her. Following Robin's death in 1982, Nicks married her widower Kim Anderson. They divorced just eight months later.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the spring of 1983, Nicks worked on her second solo album. Inspired in part by the death of her close friend Robin Anderson from leukemia in late 1982, the album was recorded mostly live and retains a rock-inspired, live quality.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Nicks released <i><a href="/wiki/The_Wild_Heart_(album)" title="The Wild Heart (album)">The Wild Heart</a></i> on June 10, 1983. The album featured many of the same musicians and producers from <i>Bella Donna</i>, but it also introduced songwriter and performer <a href="/wiki/Sandy_Stewart_(musician)" title="Sandy Stewart (musician)">Sandy Stewart</a> who lent a <a href="/wiki/Synthesizer" title="Synthesizer">synthesizer</a> sound prevalent in early 1980s rock music.</p>
<p><i>The Wild Heart</i> went double platinum, reached #5 on the Billboard 200, and featured three hit singles. Several promo-only singles, released exclusively to radio, placed on the Mainstream Rock chart. The album's closing track, "<a href="/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(Stevie_Nicks_song)" title="Beauty and the Beast (Stevie Nicks song)">Beauty and the Beast</a>", featured lyrics devoted to <a href="/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood" title="Mick Fleetwood">Mick Fleetwood</a> with whom Nicks later admitted to having a short love affair in the late 1970s. Of the many songs recorded for the album, only ten made it to the final version. The title song, "Wild Heart", was partially written during 1981. Footage exists from a <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine cover photo shoot where Nicks, while getting her make-up done, sings the work-in-progress to the instrumental line from Lindsey Buckingham's "Can't Go Back" (from <i>Mirage</i>).</p>
<p>On Memorial Day weekend (May 28 - May 30, 1983), Nicks performed a 90-minute set at the second <a href="/wiki/US_Festival" title="US Festival">US Festival</a> at Glen Helen Regional Park in San Bernardino, California, and later went on an arena and amphitheater tour from June 1983 to November 1983 throughout the United States in support of <i>The Wild Heart</i> album. Her band included <a href="/wiki/Waddy_Wachtel" title="Waddy Wachtel">Waddy Wachtel</a> on lead guitar, Wizard on bass, <a href="/wiki/Benmont_Tench" title="Benmont Tench">Benmont Tench</a> on <a href="/wiki/Organ_(music)" title="Organ (music)">organ</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roy_Bittan" title="Roy Bittan">Roy Bittan</a> on piano and electric piano, <a href="/wiki/Liberty_DeVitto" title="Liberty DeVitto">Liberty DeVitto</a> on drums, and Bobbye Hall on percussion. The songs "Beauty and the Beast", "If Anyone Falls", and "<a href="/wiki/Stand_Back_(song)" title="Stand Back (song)">Stand Back</a>", all from The Wild Heart album, were mainstays of the tour set. The album produced three Top 40 singles in "Stand Back (#5), "If Anyone Falls (#14) and "Nightbird" (#33). In fact, Nicks has often told the story of how she wrote the song "Stand Back". She wrote it shortly after she was married to Kim Anderson. The newlyweds were driving up to San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara when Prince’s song “Little Red Corvette” came on the radio. Nicks states that she started humming along to the melody of the song, and “Stand Back” was born. They stopped and got a tape recorder and she recorded the demo right there in the honeymoon suite that night. Later, when Nicks went into the studio to record the song, she called Prince and told him the story of how she wrote the song to his melody. He came to the studio that night and played synthesizers on it, although his contribution is uncredited on the album. Then, she says, “he just got up and left as if the whole thing happened in a dream.” While promoting the album on MTV, Nicks admitted that her favorite song from the set was "Nightbird", a thematic successor to "Edge of Seventeen".</p>
<p>Following the tour for <i>The Wild Heart</i>, Nicks commenced work on her third solo album. Originally titled <i>Mirror Mirror</i>, Nicks recorded a host of dark and angry<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may be based upon unreliable original research&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research?</a></i>]</span></sup> rock songs for the projected album during 1984 and 1985, including "Mirror Mirror", "Thousand Days", "Running Through the Garden", and "At the Fair". However, Nicks was unhappy with the recordings for the album "Mirror Mirror", and instead scrapped the planned album, opting to record a new batch of songs in 1985.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Rock_a_Little" title="Rock a Little">Rock a Little</a></i>, as it was re-titled, was released November 18, 1985 and issued to platinum success the next month.

A third single, "Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for You", was a relative chart failure , reaching #60. The lyric was for the Eagles member <a href="/wiki/Joe_Walsh" title="Joe Walsh">Joe Walsh</a>.

The tour marked a turning point in Nicks's career: although she had achieved significant critical acclaim, drugs were taking a toll on her performing, limiting her vocal range and pitch severely and changing her on-stage persona. It was at the end of the Australian tour that Nicks checked herself into the <a href="/wiki/Betty_Ford_Center" title="Betty Ford Center">Betty Ford Center</a> to recuperate and wean herself off of her all-consuming cocaine addiction.</p>
<p>Following the release of <i>Rock A Little</i>, Nicks toured in 1985–86.

After Buckingham chased her through the house and out onto the street and, according to <a href="/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood" title="Mick Fleetwood">Mick Fleetwood</a> in his disputed autobiography, threw her against a car and tried to strangle her, Nicks warned him that if he killed her and none of the other band members came to get him, her brother Christopher and father Jess would murder him.<sup id="cite_ref-FMart60_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FMart60-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> This interview was held at a time when many of the members of Fleetwood Mac were not speaking to each other; Nicks and Fleetwood had disputed over the use of the song "Silver Springs" (recorded in 1976) for her solo retrospective album in 1991, while Fleetwood intended to premier it on the Fleetwood Mac box set <i>The Chain: 25 Years</i> in 1992, as well as items considered<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution.&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">by whom?</a></i>]</span></sup> scandalously exaggerated in his autobiography.

The album reached #10 on the U.S. Billboard album charts, propelled by the major hit single "<a href="/wiki/Rooms_on_Fire" title="Rooms on Fire">Rooms on Fire</a>" (#16), which Nicks wrote about the album's producer and Nicks’ love interest Rupert Hine.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> It would be the sole certified hit song from the album. The follow-up to "Rooms on Fire", "Two Kinds of Love" (featuring vocals by Bruce Hornsby), became Nicks's first single to fail to chart anywhere on the Billboard or Cashbox charts. The album achieved platinum status in 1997.</p>
<p>Nicks voice was more powerful and melodic than on her previous two recordings (solo and with Fleetwood Mac), but it also developed a nasal quality attributed to her cocaine abuse and subsequent dependence on tranquilizers.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may be based upon unreliable original research&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research?</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Nicks toured the U.S. and Europe from August to November 1989, making it the first and last time that she toured Europe as a solo act.</p>
<p>In 1989, Nicks set to work with <a href="/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> on a new album. This was the first full studio album with the new line-up featuring Vito and Burnette. Nicks's contributions included the co-writes "Love is Dangerous", "Freedom", and "The Second Time", as well as her self-penned "Affairs of the Heart". The album, entitled <i><a href="/wiki/Behind_the_Mask_(album)" title="Behind the Mask (album)">Behind the Mask</a></i>, turned out to be one of the band's least commercially - and critically - successful albums. Despite its more modest success in the US, <i>Behind The Mask</i> entered the UK album chart at no.1 and has been certified Platinum there. On the last night of the <i>Behind the Mask</i> tour, Buckingham and Nicks reunited to perform "Landslide".<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> After the tour, Nicks left the group to concentrate on her solo career, and <a href="/wiki/Christine_McVie" title="Christine McVie">Christine McVie</a> retired from touring.</p>

<p>On the tenth anniversary of her solo career debut, Nicks's record label, <a href="/wiki/Modern_Records" title="Modern Records">Modern Records</a>, issued a fourteen-song retrospective gathering selected tunes and new material. Released September 3, 1991, <i><a href="/wiki/Timespace_-_The_Best_of_Stevie_Nicks" title="Timespace - The Best of Stevie Nicks">Timespace - The Best of Stevie Nicks</a></i> (#30 on The Billboard 200) included contributions from <a href="/wiki/Jon_Bon_Jovi" title="Jon Bon Jovi">Jon Bon Jovi</a> ("Sometimes It's a Bitch", for which a video was shot to promote the compilation), and <a href="/wiki/Bret_Michaels" title="Bret Michaels">Bret Michaels</a> of <a href="/wiki/Poison_(band)" title="Poison (band)">Poison</a> ("Love's a Hard Game to Play"). The third new song, "Desert Angel", was dedicated to the men and women serving in <a href="/wiki/Operation_Desert_Storm" title="Operation Desert Storm" class="mw-redirect">Operation Desert Storm</a>. The compilation also included re-mastered editions of some of Nicks's most commercially successful singles. The album eventually went platinum in 1997.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> also released a four-disc box set, <i><a href="/wiki/25_Years_-_The_Chain" title="25 Years - The Chain">25 Years - The Chain</a></i>, in November 1992 featuring songs spanning the band's entire career, with a focus on the 1975–87 era. The compilation, later also issued as a slimmer two-disc volume,and featured album tracks, b-sides, alternate mixes, and previously unreleased tracks like "Heart of Stone", "Love Shines", "Make Me a Mask", and "Paper Doll" (which Nicks co-wrote).</p>
<p>During the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> used the Fleetwood Mac hit "<a href="/wiki/Don%27t_Stop_(Fleetwood_Mac_song)" title="Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)">Don't Stop</a>" (written by Christine McVie) as his campaign theme song. The <i>Rumours</i>-era line-up of <a href="/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> reunited to perform the song at his 1993 Inaugural Gala, sowing the seeds for a later reunion album and tour.</p>
<p>In late 1993, while Nicks held a baby shower at her house, she tripped and gashed her forehead on a fireplace. Not feeling any pain, Nicks realized she needed help and endured a painful 47-day detox from <a href="/wiki/Klonopin" title="Klonopin" class="mw-redirect">Klonopin</a> in the hospital. Her weight had reached a peak at 175 lb (79.4&#160;kg), enhanced even more by her short stature.</p>
<p>Nicks used material written mostly in previous years to record a solo album in 1993 and 1994 that was plagued by her dependence on Klonopin. The tracks include "Greta", "Love Is Like a River", and "Listen to the Rain" dating from the mid-1980s, "Destiny" from the early 1970s <a href="/wiki/Buckingham_Nicks" title="Buckingham Nicks">Buckingham Nicks</a> era (which shares some lyrics with the song "Enchanted"), and "Rose Garden", originally written when Nicks was 17. Other material came from various co-writers, including frequent late '80s/early '90s collaborator <a href="/wiki/Mike_Campbell" title="Mike Campbell">Mike Campbell</a> and a cover of Bob Dylan's "Just Like a Woman".</p>
<p>Released May 23, 1994, <i><a href="/wiki/Street_Angel_(album)" title="Street Angel (album)">Street Angel</a></i> (#45 on the Billboard 200 albums chart) became the most poorly received record of her solo career. "Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind" from the album made #57 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, and "Blue Denim" was an even less successful hit, although the song did gain more promotion, such as her appearance on <i>Late Night With David Letterman</i>. Nicks was crushed by the focus on her weight and the poor reception of the album despite her successful, three-month tour featuring friends and old band musicians including drummer Russ Kunkel and Fleetwood Mac lead guitarist Rick Vito. Highlights from the tour included "Stand Back"; "Rhiannon"’ and "Talk To Me"; "Edge of Seventeen"; and a rare solo version of the Fleetwood Mac hit, "The Chain". Disgusted by the criticism she received during the tour for being overweight, Nicks vowed to never set foot on a stage again unless she lost the weight.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1995 and 1997, Nicks contributed the song "Twisted", a duet with <a href="/wiki/Lindsey_Buckingham" title="Lindsey Buckingham">Lindsey Buckingham</a>, to the <i><a href="/wiki/Twister_(1996_film)" title="Twister (1996 film)">Twister</a></i> movie soundtrack, the <a href="/wiki/Sheryl_Crow" title="Sheryl Crow">Sheryl Crow</a> penned "Somebody Stand By Me" to the <i><a href="/wiki/Boys_on_the_Side" title="Boys on the Side">Boys on the Side</a></i> soundtrack, and remade <a href="/wiki/Tom_Petty" title="Tom Petty">Tom Petty</a>'s "Free Fallin'" for Fox's TV hit <i><a href="/wiki/Party_of_Five" title="Party of Five">Party of Five</a></i>.</p>

<p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of <i>Rumours</i>, the 1975-1987 <a href="/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> line-up reunited for an album and tour beginning in May 1997. <a href="/wiki/Lindsey_Buckingham" title="Lindsey Buckingham">Lindsey Buckingham</a> had enlisted the help of the band's rhythm section <a href="/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood" title="Mick Fleetwood">Mick Fleetwood</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_McVie" title="John McVie">John McVie</a> for a planned solo album, eventually leading to the reunion of the band. The tour, featuring a slimmer Nicks, was a major success, with the opening shows recorded for video and album release. The video, which was recorded on their first and second nights performing together in 10 years and in surround sound, garnered critical acclaim. It was recorded on a <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood" class="mw-redirect">Hollywood</a> sound stage at Warner Bros. Studios with an audience that included many of Hollywood's elite, and featured the <a href="/wiki/Spirit_of_Troy" title="Spirit of Troy">USC Trojan Marching Band</a> on the songs "Tusk" and "Don't Stop".</p>
<p>This live release, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dance_(album)" title="The Dance (album)">The Dance</a></i>, debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 in the autumn of 1997 and earned the group a <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award" title="Grammy Award">Grammy</a> nomination. Two promotional singles — both Nicks songs — were released: "Silver Springs", for which Nicks earned a Rock Vocal Performance Grammy nomination, and "Landslide". In 1998, the group was inducted into the <a href="/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame" title="Rock and Roll Hall of Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> and won the Outstanding Contribution at the <a href="/wiki/BRIT_Awards" title="BRIT Awards" class="mw-redirect">BRIT Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Nicks put plans for a new solo album on hold when she was approached by <a href="/wiki/Warner_Music_Group" title="Warner Music Group">Warner Music</a> to release a solo career-spanning box set, to finish her contract with <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Records" title="Atlantic Records">Atlantic Records</a> in the US.

<p>The box set <i><a href="/wiki/Enchanted_(Stevie_Nicks_album)" title="Enchanted (Stevie Nicks album)" class="mw-redirect">Enchanted</a></i>, was released to acclaim on April 28, 1998 with liner notes from Nicks, as well as exclusive and rare <a href="/wiki/Photographs" title="Photographs" class="mw-redirect">photographs</a>. Featuring successful solo hits, Nicks also included b-sides ("Garbo", written in 1973 and recorded for <i>The Wild Heart</i> era), rare soundtrack contributions ("Blue Lamp", "Sleeping Angel", "Battle of the Dragon", "Violet and Blue"), duets ("Whenever I Call You Friend" with <a href="/wiki/Kenny_Loggins" title="Kenny Loggins">Kenny Loggins</a>; "Gold", with <a href="/wiki/John_Stewart_(musician)" title="John Stewart (musician)">John Stewart</a>), and covers ("It's Late", "Free Fallin'", and <a href="/wiki/Warren_Zevon" title="Warren Zevon">Warren Zevon</a>'s "Reconsider Me"). Nicks also included demos ("Twisted", "Sweet Girl") and "Long Distance Winner" from the <i>Buckingham Nicks</i> album.

The box set was supported with a successful US tour with a more varied set list incorporating rare material such as "Rose Garden", "Garbo" and "Sleeping Angel". The set sold 56,000 units in its first week (an excellent achievement for a three-disc box set) and was certified Gold.</p>
<p>In 1998, Nicks contributed songs to the <i><a href="/wiki/Practical_Magic" title="Practical Magic">Practical Magic</a></i> soundtrack, recording a new version of "Crystal", with Nicks on lead vocals (Lindsey Buckingham sings lead in the original) and "If You Ever Did Believe", originally a mid-'70s demo which shared the lyrics "And the days go by/Doing nothing about them/How much time will I have to spend?" with another mid-70's demo, "Forest Of The Black Roses". <a href="/wiki/Sheryl_Crow" title="Sheryl Crow">Sheryl Crow</a> produced the two tracks for the soundtrack, and Nicks and Crow released a music video to <a href="/wiki/VH1" title="VH1">VH1</a> to follow for "If You Ever Did Believe". The song became a moderate radio hit. She also took part in a benefit concert for Don Henley's Walden Woods Project. She sang two songs including the classic "At Last", which would later be included on an AT&amp;T promotional CD.</p>
<p>Nicks received further accolades when <i><a href="/wiki/People_(magazine)" title="People (magazine)">People</a></i> magazine named her one of the 50 Most Beautiful People, and in 1999, she ranked #14 on a list of <a href="/wiki/VH1" title="VH1">VH1</a>'s Greatest Women of Rock, and #1 Greatest Woman of Rock voted by VH1 viewers. VH1 also featured an episode of their <i>Behind The Music</i> documentary program on Nicks's career and comeback. In viewer polls, it was voted the best episode at the time of its broadcast. Nicks was a featured artist on the acclaimed VH1 Storytellers Concert Program that same year.</p>
<p>Nicks had begun writing actively for <i><a href="/wiki/Trouble_in_Shangri-La" title="Trouble in Shangri-La">Trouble in Shangri-La</a></i> in 1994 and 1995 with "Trouble in Shangri-La" and "Love Is", as she came out of her Klonopin dependency. According to Nicks, friend and former musical partner Tom Petty was responsible for convincing her to write music again. In 1999, Nicks began recording songs for the <i>Trouble in Shangri-La</i> album with <a href="/wiki/Sheryl_Crow" title="Sheryl Crow">Sheryl Crow</a>, who produced five tracks. When Crow dropped out of the project over a scheduling conflict, Nicks approached R&amp;B producer <a href="/wiki/Dallas_Austin" title="Dallas Austin">Dallas Austin</a> to work on tracks at his Atlanta recording studio. She had been impressed with his production work on <a href="/wiki/TLC_(band)" title="TLC (band)">TLC's</a> song "<a href="/wiki/Unpretty" title="Unpretty">Unpretty</a>". The Dallas Austin sessions have never surfaced.

<p>The album featured songs that Nicks had originally written and rehearsed in the '70s such as "Candlebright" (known in some fan circles as "Nomad", from 1970), "Sorcerer" (circa Buckingham Nicks), and "Planets of the Universe" (written around 1976).</p>
<p>Nicks's voice on the new recordings was more tuneful and passionate<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may be based upon unreliable original research&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research?</a></i>]</span></sup> than on <i>Street Angel</i>, her previous solo outing. Nicks had worked with a voice coach since 1997, lending her voice more control and protecting it from the stress of lengthy touring schedules.</p>
<p>Released May 1, 2001, Trouble in Shangri-La restored Nicks's solo career to critical and commercial success. The album debuted at #5 on the Billboard 200, her best album chart position since The Wild Heart almost two decades earlier, which also hit #5. The singles "Every Day", "Planets of the Universe", and "Sorcerer" (which originally appeared on the 1984 Streets of Fire soundtrack with Marilyn Martin singing lead and Stevie singing backup) helped promote the album, performing well in the Adult Album Alternative radio markets. One of the dance remixes for "Planets of the Universe" reached #1 on the Billboard Dance and Club Play chart. The original Trouble in Shangri-La album version of the song was later nominated for a <a href="/wiki/Grammy_Award" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</a> (Best Female Rock Vocal Performance). The <a href="/wiki/RIAA" title="RIAA" class="mw-redirect">RIAA</a> certified the album Gold in June 2001.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/VH1" title="VH1">VH1</a> named Nicks their "Artist of the Month" for May 2001, airing short interviews and Nicks's catalog of videos throughout the month, including a new video for "Every Day". She also made a video for "Sorcerer", which began airing later in the year. The album featured collaborations with <a href="/wiki/Natalie_Maines" title="Natalie Maines">Natalie Maines</a> (Dixie Chicks) on the country duet "Too Far from Texas", <a href="/wiki/Sarah_McLachlan" title="Sarah McLachlan">Sarah McLachlan</a> on the ballad "Love Is" and <a href="/wiki/Macy_Gray" title="Macy Gray">Macy Gray</a> on the soft, funky "Bombay Sapphires".

<p>In 2001, while touring for <i>Trouble in Shangri-La</i>, Nicks received the news that the other members of Fleetwood Mac were planning a new studio album. The line-up consisted of the rhythm section of <a href="/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood" title="Mick Fleetwood">Mick Fleetwood</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_McVie" title="John McVie">John McVie</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Lindsey_Buckingham" title="Lindsey Buckingham">Lindsey Buckingham</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Christine_McVie" title="Christine McVie">Christine McVie</a> opted out of the project in its early stages, as she had retired from the group's heavy touring schedule (she had to be coaxed into participating in the 1997 reunion tour).</p>
<p>Nicks sent off a demo tape of around 20 previously unreleased songs, some of which had already been considered for previous Fleetwood Mac albums or solo albums. After the end of her solo tour, Nicks convened with the other members of the band for recording during 2002. The album, which Buckingham had planned as a two-disc set, became a half-Buckingham, half-Nicks record, with nine songs each. The decision to reduce the album to a single disc album was not reached without much drama within the band, as can be seen in the "Destiny Rules" documentary of the making of <i>Say You Will</i>, which aired on VH1 and is also available on DVD release. Lindsey Buckingham pressed for a 2-disc set, while Nicks and eventually Mick Fleetwood as well opposed it, because of uncertainty in the music industry. Buckingham's material was notably more experimental and unusual (some coming from his unreleased <i>Gift of Screws</i> album), and Nicks contributed a series of passionate songs, including her reaction to <a href="/wiki/9/11_terrorist_attacks" title="9/11 terrorist attacks" class="mw-redirect">9/11 terrorist attacks</a>, "Illume", an ode to <a href="/wiki/Sheryl_Crow" title="Sheryl Crow">Sheryl Crow</a>, "Silver Girl", and various songs from earlier eras: "Smile At You" had been written for <i>Tusk</i> and also recorded during the <i>Mirage</i> sessions; "Running Through the Garden" was originally intended for <i>Rock a Little</i>; and "Goodbye Baby" was written around 1976 as a piano ballad, "The Tower".</p>
<p>Nicks was ranked #52 on <a href="/wiki/VH1" title="VH1">VH1</a>'s 100 Sexiest Artists in 2002.</p>
<p>The album was released on Reprise Records, although Fleetwood Mac had been shopping around with a new record deal. They had been offered a deal by <a href="/wiki/Interscope_Records" title="Interscope Records">Interscope Records</a>, run by Nicks's former lover and producer <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Iovine" title="Jimmy Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a>. Eventually the band decided to stick with their longtime label, Reprise Records, as a result of a "larger advance offer" by Reprise, according to Lindsey Buckingham. According to Forbes Fleetwood Mac was given a "lucrative" 2-album contract for the release of "Say You Will".</p>
<p>The album, <i><a href="/wiki/Say_You_Will" title="Say You Will">Say You Will</a></i>, was released to mixed reviews in April 2003, but still became a Top 3 hit on the Billboard 200 selling over 300,000 copies in its first week of release. The group supported the album by embarking on a mammoth world tour lasting until September 2004. They later released two DVD releases: the concert film <i>Live in Boston</i> (RIAA certified Platinum) and the documentary <i>Destiny Rules</i>. The tour become one of the highest grossing concert tours of 2003, headlining at such venues as <a href="/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden" title="Madison Square Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>, <a href="/wiki/Staples_Center" title="Staples Center">Staples Center</a>, <a href="/wiki/Philips_Arena" title="Philips Arena">Philips Arena</a>, <a href="/wiki/Allstate_Arena" title="Allstate Arena">Allstate Arena</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ford_Center" title="Ford Center">Ford Center</a>, <a href="/wiki/MGM_Grand_Garden_Arena" title="MGM Grand Garden Arena">MGM Grand</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rose_Garden_(arena)" title="Rose Garden (arena)">Rose Garden</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fleet_Center" title="Fleet Center">Fleet Center</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hershey_Park" title="Hershey Park" class="mw-redirect">Hershey Park</a> and many more.</p>
<p>Fleetwood Mac won an <a href="/wiki/American_Music_Award" title="American Music Award">American Music Award</a> in 2003 for Best Pop/Rock Band, Duo or Group, up against <a href="/wiki/Matchbox_20" title="Matchbox 20" class="mw-redirect">Matchbox 20</a> and <a href="/wiki/3_Doors_Down" title="3 Doors Down">3 Doors Down</a>. Fleetwood Mac accepted the award at a hotel via satellite from <a href="/wiki/Hamburg,_Germany" title="Hamburg, Germany" class="mw-redirect">Hamburg, Germany</a> where they were on tour supporting "Say You Will".</p>
<p>In an interview with the UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph (8/9/07), Nicks noted that she is unwilling to carry on with the band unless Christine McVie returns. However, in March 2008 it was announced that singer Sheryl Crow would be joining Fleetwood Mac, one point being made that she would be a support for Stevie when they began work. Crow declared 2009 as the year when the public would again experience the group but stopped short of confirming whether it would be with new material or by touring.</p>

<p>In late 2004, Nicks began visiting Army and Navy medical centers in Washington, D.C. While visiting wounded service men and women, Nicks became determined to find an object she could leave with each soldier that would raise their spirits, motivate, and give them something to look forward to each day. She eventually decided to purchase hundreds of iPod Nanos, load them with music, artists, and play-lists which she would hand select, and autograph them. She now regularly delivers these tokens of her appreciation, bringing her closest friends to share the experience.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 2006, Nicks held a get-together to raise money for her charity work. Many of her peers made contributions. Nicks continues to develop this philanthropic endeavor.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:0 1em;">So, as Mick [Fleetwood] and I went from room to room delivering their tiny iPod, they told us their stories. Mick became his tall, loving, father figure, English self, taking in every word they said, remaining calm (at least on the outside) inspiring them. We floated from room to room down thru the halls of the 2 hospitals over a three-day period. We gave out all our iPods. Right before I left for D.C., Stephen Tyler and Joe Perry dug into their pockets and came up with $10,000 for me. In my eyes they went from the coolest rock stars to generous great men; as my press agent Liz Rosenberg said, every returning wounded soldier should be given an iPod. It will be an integral part of their recovery.</td>

"Even when platforms went completely out of style, I kept wearing them because I didn't want to go back to being 5-foot-3 inches [1.60 m] in heels", she told <i><a href="/wiki/Allure_(magazine)" title="Allure (magazine)">Allure</a></i> magazine in 1995.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> Over the years, Nicks has developed a style which she calls her "uniform" (Spotlight on Stevie Nicks, 96.1 <a href="/wiki/WSRS" title="WSRS">WSRS</a>, August 5, 2001),<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> which is best exemplified by the outfit worn on the cover of Fleetwood Mac's <i>Rumours</i>, perhaps the base inspiration for many of her costumes. Another trademark of Nicks's is a Dickens-style gentleman's formal top hat, which she began wearing in the late <a href="/wiki/1970s" title="1970s">1970s</a>. During the early <a href="/wiki/1980s" title="1980s">1980s</a> she wore velvet Renaissance poets' berets with plume feathers (as shown in the vintage photo used on the cover of her March 2007 CD release <i><a href="/wiki/Crystal_Visions_-_The_Very_Best_of_Stevie_Nicks" title="Crystal Visions - The Very Best of Stevie Nicks">Crystal Visions - The Very Best of Stevie Nicks</a></i>). In the late <a href="/wiki/1980s" title="1980s">1980s</a> and early <a href="/wiki/1990s" title="1990s">1990s</a>, she wore fashionable ladies hats on stage and to this day, often still sports a black top hat adorned with giant plumes.</p>
<p>Many of Nicks's shawls and capes also have an association with her songs in her live performances, many becoming as signature in live performances as the songs themselves. These include a red/crimson shawl for "Sara", white for "Edge of Seventeen", gold for "Gold Dust Woman" and black with round gold circles for "Stand Back". One of her trademarks is twirling across the stage with shawls flying during the interlude of her classic songs, notably "Stand Back" and "Gypsy".</p>
<p>Nicks has said that her vocal style and performance antics evolved from female singers like <a href="/wiki/Grace_Slick" title="Grace Slick">Grace Slick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Janis_Joplin" title="Janis Joplin">Janis Joplin</a>. She admitted inspiration when she saw Joplin perform live (and opened for with her first band "Fritz") shortly before Joplin's death. Nicks owns a strand of Joplin's stage beads. She also commented that she once saw a woman in her audience dressed in dripping chiffon with a <a href="/wiki/Gibson_Girl" title="Gibson Girl">Gibson Girl</a> hairstyle and big boots and Nicks knew she wanted something similar. She took the look and made it her own.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> Another important part of Nicks's image is her jewelry. Nicks typically introduces one signature piece of jewelry during each tour. Such items have included silver bracelets, crescent moon pendant, pyramid shaped pendant, winged-heart pendant, gold crosses and, most recently, a <a href="/wiki/Tiffany_%26_Co." title="Tiffany &amp; Co.">Tiffany</a> pendant with diamonds meaning "longevity." The crescent moon pendant is arguably the most iconic of all Nicks's jewelry – the original was bought while she was in England on tour with Fleetwood Mac during the <i>Tusk</i> era. Nicks then had her personal jeweler, Henri David of Philadelphia, make replicas of the moon pendant which become treasured gifts to her friends. In recent years, celebrity pals such as <a href="/wiki/Bette_Midler" title="Bette Midler">Bette Midler</a> and ice-skating star <a href="/wiki/Tai_Babilonia" title="Tai Babilonia">Tai Babilonia</a> have been photographed wearing their "Stevie moons".</p>
<p>Nicks has even commented in interviews recently that she never would have dreamed that her trademark "Bella Donna/Witchy Woman" image would have been taken so seriously by her fans, often joking that she doesn't live her private life in her stage clothes and "Stevie garb" as many people seem to think. However, she greatly credits her career/stage image for its role in giving her a trademark that has made her unique and "timeless".</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Stevie_Nicks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18" title="Edit section: Microphone and tambourine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Microphone and tambourine</span></h4>
<p>Stevie Nicks is known for her use of the <a href="/wiki/Sennheiser" title="Sennheiser">Sennheiser</a> MD-441-U5 microphone.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Its interesting appearance has made it synonymous with Nicks's early tours. Also synonymous with Nicks's microphone are the items she chooses to decorate her microphone stand with. Over the years, such items have included roses, ribbons, chiffon, crystal beads, scarves and small stuffed animals.</p>
<p>Upon being asked in a question forum on her official website about playing the <a href="/wiki/Tambourine" title="Tambourine">tambourine</a>, Nicks stated that she began playing the tambourine upon joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975, feeling the need to do something onstage during songs that featured Lindsey or Christine. Like her microphone, her tambourine usually features scarves and/or streamers. Nicks's trademark tambourine since the early 1980s is in the shape of a black half-moon.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Stevie_Nicks&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19" title="Edit section: Rumors of witchcraft">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rumors of witchcraft</span></h4>
<p>One of the more persistent rumors which has trailed Nicks through the years is that she is a <a href="/wiki/Witch" title="Witch" class="mw-redirect">witch</a> and is heavily involved in <a href="/wiki/Wicca" title="Wicca">Wicca</a>. While she admits to having a high regard for the mythic and gothic, she denies any solitary dedication to any one religion, including Wicca. She speaks about this erroneous image in a 2006 interview.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> Though her work is copyrighted under the name <b>Welsh Witch Music</b>, some allege that the name is a retrospective reference to the name <i>Rhiannon</i> and does not provide any proof or suggestion that Nicks, herself, is a witch, while others would disagree with this characterization and mention simply that the name speaks for itself. It is quite plainly known to dedicated <a href="/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac" title="Fleetwood Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> fans that between 1975 and 1977, Stevie would always start Rhiannon by stating "This is a song about a Welsh witch." In a <a href="/wiki/Yahoo!" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a> interview on April 28, 1998, Nicks said of the infamous rumor: "I have no idea what precipitated those rumors...I am not a witch. Get a life!" Nicks also stated in a 1983 <a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight" title="Entertainment Tonight">Entertainment Tonight</a> interview: "I spent thousands of dollars on beautiful black clothes and had to stop wearing them for a long time because a lot of people scared me. And that's really unfair to me, I think, for people – other people – to conjure up their ideas of what I am or what I believe in." In a 1998 <i><a href="/wiki/Redbook" title="Redbook">Redbook</a></i> magazine article, Nicks spoke of her faith, stating that she believes in angels and knows that she is alive today because "there was a God looking out" for her during her years of addiction.</p>

			<p>The <b>theory of multiple intelligences</b> was proposed by <a href="/wiki/Howard_Gardner" title="Howard Gardner">Howard Gardner</a> in 1983, to more accurately define the concept of intelligence and address whether methods which claim to measure intelligence (or aspects thereof) are truly <a href="/wiki/Scientific" title="Scientific" class="mw-redirect">scientific</a>.</p>
<p>Gardner's theory argues that intelligence, particularly as it is traditionally defined, does not sufficiently encompass the wide variety of abilities humans display. In his conception, a child who masters multiplication easily is not necessarily more intelligent <i>overall</i> than a child who struggles to do so. The second child may be stronger in another <i>kind</i> of intelligence, and therefore may best learn the given material through a different approach, may excel in a field outside of mathematics, or may even be looking through the multiplication learning process at a fundamentally deeper level that hides a potentially higher mathematical intelligence than in the one who memorizes the concept easily.</p>

<p>Gardner originally identified seven core intelligences: <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">linguistic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logical</a>-<a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Space" title="Space">spatial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Body" title="Body">bodily</a>-<a href="/wiki/Kinesthetic" title="Kinesthetic" class="mw-redirect">kinesthetic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music" title="Music">musical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Interpersonal_relationships" title="Interpersonal relationships" class="mw-redirect">interpersonal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Self" title="Self" class="mw-redirect">intrapersonal</a>. In 1997 at the symposium "MIND 97" (Multiple Intelligences New Directions) he added an eighth, the "Naturalist" Intelligence. Investigation continues on whether there are Existentialist (existential) and <a href="/wiki/Spiritual_intelligence" title="Spiritual intelligence">Spiritualist (spiritual)</a> Intelligences.</p>
<p>The theory has been widely criticized in the psychology and educational theory communities. The most common criticisms argue that Gardner's theory is based on his own <a href="/wiki/Intuition" title="Intuition">intuition</a> rather than <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empirical</a> data and that the intelligences are just other names for <a href="/wiki/Talent" title="Talent">talents</a> or <a href="/wiki/Personality_psychology" title="Personality psychology">personality</a> types. Despite these criticisms, the theory has enjoyed a great deal of popularity amongst educators over the past twenty years. There are several schools which espouse MI as a pedagogy, and many individual teachers who incorporate some or all of the theory into their methodology. Many books and educational materials exist which explain the theory and how it may be applied to the classroom.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Gardner's categories of intelligence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gardner's categories of intelligence</span></h2>
<p>The categories of intelligence proposed by Gardner are:</p>
<p><a name="Bodily-kinesthetic" id="Bodily-kinesthetic"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Bodily-kinesthetic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Bodily-kinesthetic</span></h3>
<p>This area has to do with bodily movement. People who have this intelligence usually learn better by getting up and moving around, and are generally good at physical activities such as sports or dance. They may enjoy acting or performing, and in general they are good at building and making things. They often learn best by doing something physically, rather than reading or hearing about it. Those with strong bodily-kinesthetic intelligence seem to use what might be termed <a href="/wiki/Muscle_memory" title="Muscle memory">muscle memory</a> - they remember things through their body such as verbal memory or images.</p>
<p>Careers that suit those with this intelligence include athletes, dancers, actors, surgeons, doctors, builders, and soldiers. Although these careers can be duplicated through virtual simulation they will not produce the actual physical learning that is needed in this intelligence.</p>
<p><a name="Interpersonal" id="Interpersonal"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Interpersonal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interpersonal</span></h3>
<p>This area has to do with interaction with others. People who have a high interpersonal intelligence tend to be <a href="/wiki/Extrovert" title="Extrovert" class="mw-redirect">extroverts</a>, characterized by their sensitivity to others' moods, feelings, temperaments and motivations, and their ability to cooperate in order to work as part of a group. They communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They typically learn best by working with others and often enjoy discussion and debate.</p>
<p>Careers that suit those with this intelligence include <a href="/wiki/Politician" title="Politician">politicians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Manager" title="Manager">managers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Teacher" title="Teacher">teachers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Social_worker" title="Social worker" class="mw-redirect">social workers</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Verbal-linguistic" id="Verbal-linguistic"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Verbal-linguistic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Verbal-linguistic</span></h3>
<p>This area has to do with words, spoken or written. People with high verbal-linguistic intelligence display a facility with words and languages. They are typically good at reading, writing, telling stories and memorizing words along with dates. They tend to learn best by reading, taking notes, listening to lectures, and discussion and debate. They are also frequently skilled at explaining, teaching and oration or persuasive speaking. Those with verbal-linguistic intelligence learn foreign languages very easily as they have high verbal memory and recall, and an ability to understand and manipulate syntax and structure.</p>
<p>This intelligence is highest in writers, lawyers, philosophers, journalists, politicians, poets, and teachers.</p>
<p><a name="Logical-mathematical" id="Logical-mathematical"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Logical-mathematical">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Logical-mathematical</span></h3>
<p>This area has to do with logic, abstractions, reasoning, and numbers. While it is often assumed that those with this intelligence naturally excel in mathematics, chess, computer programming and other logical or numerical activities, a more accurate definition places emphasis on traditional mathematical ability and more reasoning capabilities, abstract patterns of recognition, scientific thinking and investigation, and the ability to perform complex calculations. It correlates strongly with traditional concepts of "intelligence" or <a href="/wiki/IQ" title="IQ" class="mw-redirect">IQ</a>.</p>
<p>Many scientists, mathematicians, engineers, doctors and economists function in this type of intelligence.</p>
<p><a name="Naturalistic" id="Naturalistic"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Naturalistic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Naturalistic</span></h3>
<p>This area has to do with nature, nurturing and relating information to one's natural surroundings. This type of intelligence was not part of Gardner's original theory of Multiple Intelligences, but was added to the theory in 1997. Those with it are said to have greater sensitivity to nature and their place within it, the ability to nurture and grow things, and greater ease in caring for, taming and interacting with animals. They may also be able to discern changes in <a href="/wiki/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a> or similar fluctuations in their natural surroundings. Recognizing and classifying things are at the core of a naturalist. They must connect a new experience with prior knowledge to truly learn something new.</p>
<p>"Naturalists" learn best when the subject involves collecting and analyzing, or is closely related to something prominent in nature; they also don't enjoy learning unfamiliar or seemingly useless subjects with little or no connections to nature. It is advised that naturalistic learners would learn more through being outside or in a kinesthetic way.</p>
<p>The theory behind this intelligence is often criticized, much like the spiritual or existential intelligence (see below), as it is seen by many as not indicative of an intelligence but rather an interest.</p>
<p>Careers that suit those with this intelligence include scientists, naturalists, conservationists, gardeners and farmers.</p>
<p><a name="Intrapersonal" id="Intrapersonal"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Intrapersonal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Intrapersonal</span></h3>
<p>This area has to do with <a href="/wiki/Introspection" title="Introspection">introspective</a> and self-reflective capacities. Those who are strongest in this intelligence are typically <a href="/wiki/Introversion" title="Introversion" class="mw-redirect">introverts</a> and prefer to work alone. They are usually highly self-aware and capable of understanding their own emotions, goals and motivations. They often have an affinity for thought-based pursuits such as philosophy. They learn best when allowed to concentrate on the subject by themselves. There is often a high level of perfectionism associated with this intelligence.</p>
<p>Careers that suit those with this intelligence include philosophers, psychologists, theologians, writers and scientists.</p>
<p><a name="Visual-spatial" id="Visual-spatial"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Visual-spatial">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Visual-spatial</span></h3>
<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Spatial_reasoning" title="Spatial reasoning" class="mw-redirect">Spatial reasoning</a></div>
<p>This area has to do with vision and spatial judgment. People with strong visual-spatial intelligence are typically very good at visualizing and mentally manipulating objects. Those with strong spatial intelligence are often proficient at solving puzzles. They have a strong visual memory and are often artistically inclined. Those with visual-spatial intelligence also generally have a very good sense of direction and may also have very good hand-eye coordination, although this is normally seen as a characteristic of the bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.</p>
<p>Some critics<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> point out the high <a href="/wiki/Correlation" title="Correlation">correlation</a> between the spatial and mathematical abilities, which seems to disprove the clear separation of the intelligences as Gardner theorized. Since solving a mathematical problem involves reassuringly manipulating symbols and numbers, spatial intelligence is involved in visually changing the reality. A thorough understanding of the two intelligences precludes this criticism, however, as the two intelligences do not precisely conform to the definitions of visual and mathematical abilities. Although they may share certain characteristics, they are easily distinguished by several factors, and there are many with strong logical-mathematical intelligence.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Careers that suit those with this intelligence include <a href="/wiki/Artists" title="Artists" class="mw-redirect">artists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Engineers" title="Engineers" class="mw-redirect">engineers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Architects" title="Architects" class="mw-redirect">architects</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Musical" id="Musical"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Musical">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Musical</span></h3>
<p>This area has to do with <a href="/wiki/Rhythm" title="Rhythm">rhythm</a>, music, and hearing. Those who have a high level of musical-rhythmic intelligence display greater sensitivity to sounds, rhythms, <a href="/wiki/Tone" title="Tone">tones</a>, and music. They normally have good pitch and may even have <a href="/wiki/Absolute_pitch" title="Absolute pitch">absolute pitch</a>, and are able to sing, play musical instruments, and compose music. Since there is a strong auditory component to this intelligence, those who are strongest in it may learn best via lecture. In addition, they will often use songs or rhythms to learn and memorize information, and may work best with music playing in the background.</p>
<p>Careers that suit those with this intelligence include instrumentalists, singers, conductors, disc-jockeys, orators, writers (to a certain extent) and composers.</p>

<p>Other intelligences have been suggested or explored by Gardner and his colleagues, including spiritual, existential and moral intelligence. Gardner excluded <a href="/wiki/Spiritual_intelligence" title="Spiritual intelligence">spiritual intelligence</a> due to what he perceived as the inability to codify criteria comparable to the other "intelligences". Existential intelligence (the capacity to raise and reflect on philosophical questions about life, death, and ultimate realities) meets most of the criteria with the exception of identifiable areas of the brain that specialize for this faculty.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Moral capacities were excluded because they are normative rather than descriptive.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

On one hand they have severe mental disabilities and thus impaired social skills, but on the other they have some extraordinary mental abilities not found in most people. The Savant Syndrome skills involve striking feats of memory and often include arithmetic calculation and sometimes unusual abilities in art or music. There is actually a disproportionate regularity with which the triad of blindness, mental disability and musical genius occurs in savant syndrome.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Examples include <a href="/wiki/Derek_Paravicini" title="Derek Paravicini">Derek Paravicini</a> who has severe learning disability but can remember every song he has ever heard.</p>
<p>Others with savant syndrome are not autistic, but develop these abilities later on in life usually as a result of some accident, illness or trauma. For example <a href="/wiki/Alonzo_Clemons" title="Alonzo Clemons">Alonzo Clemons</a> was a regular child until he suffered <a href="/wiki/Brain_damage" title="Brain damage">brain damage</a> as a result of a fall.

In the case of savants, the damage to the brain has somehow disrupted normal functioning and has allowed the brain to access these latent skills.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Traditionally, schools have emphasized the development of logical intelligence and linguistic intelligence (mainly reading and writing). While many students function well in this environment, there are those who do not. Gardner's theory argues that students will be better served by a broader vision of education, wherein teachers use different methodologies, exercises and activities to reach all students, not just those who excel at linguistic and logical intelligence.</p>
<p>Many teachers see the theory as simple common sense. Some say that it validates what they already know: that students learn in different ways. On the other hand, James Traub's article in <i>The New Republic</i> notes that Gardner's system has not been accepted by most academics in intelligence or teaching.</p>
<p>George Miller, the esteemed psychologist credited with discovering the mechanisms by which short term memory operates, wrote in <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> that Gardner's argument boiled down to "hunch and opinion" (p. 20). And Gardner's subsequent work has done very little to shift the balance of opinion. A recent issue of <i>Psychology, Public Policy, and Law</i> devoted to the study of intelligence contained virtually no reference to Gardner's work. Most people who study intelligence view M.I. theory as rhetoric rather than science, and they're divided on the virtues of the rhetoric.</p>
<p>The application of the theory of multiple intelligences varies widely. It runs the gamut from a teacher who, when confronted with a student having difficulties, uses a different approach to teach the material, to an entire school using MI as a framework. In general, those who subscribe to the theory strive to provide opportunities for their students to use and develop all the different intelligences, not just the few at which they naturally excel.</p>
<p>A Harvard-led study of 41 schools using the theory came to the conclusion that in these schools there was "a culture of hard work, respect, and caring; a faculty that collaborated and learned from each other; classrooms that engaged students through constrained but meaningful choices, and a sharp focus on enabling students to produce high-quality work."<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Of the schools implementing Gardner's theory, the most well-known is <a href="/wiki/New_City_School" title="New City School">New City School</a>, in St. Louis, Missouri, which has been using the theory since 1988. The school's teachers have produced two books for teachers, <i>Celebrating Multiple Intelligences</i> and <i>Succeeding With Multiple Intelligences</i> and the principal, Thomas Hoerr, has written <i>Becoming a Multiple Intelligences School</i> as well as many articles on the practical applications of the theory. The school has also hosted four conferences, each attracting over 200 educators from around the world and remains a valuable resource for teachers interested in implementing the theory in their own classrooms.</p>
<p>Thomas Armstrong considers that <a href="/wiki/Waldorf_education" title="Waldorf education">Waldorf education</a> organically engages all of Gardner's seven intelligences.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Criticism" id="Criticism"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h3>
<p>Criticisms of the theory's application in schools come in four major forms. First, opponents argue that the theory may lead to a sort of intellectual relativism, wherein students' failures are explained away as being an example of a different kind of intelligence, not a lesser one. As a result, there are those in the Gifted and Talented community who have criticized Gardner's theory, because any support of the idea that all children are equally gifted, just in different ways, might lead to the reduction or broadening of Gifted and Talented programs. Gardner himself has said that he does not believe his theory will have this type of consequence for gifted programs, and that he never intended his theory to affirm that all people are equally gifted, but rather that the definition of intelligence was too narrow to encompass all types of intelligence.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>The second major problem with Gardener's theory is that in his denial that there is any real statistical factor (such as "g") contributing to many intellectual tasks, he does not account for that correlation in the empirical data. That is, every multiple domain <a href="/wiki/IQ_test" title="IQ test" class="mw-redirect">IQ test</a> ever normed (<a href="/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale" title="Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale">Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stanford-Binet_IQ_test" title="Stanford-Binet IQ test" class="mw-redirect">Stanford-Binet IQ test</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_K._Hoeflin" title="Ronald K. Hoeflin">Ronald K. Hoeflin</a>'s Mega test) has shown that all the areas tested are correlated. This trend is also shown in tests like the <a href="/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examination" title="Graduate Record Examination">Graduate Record Examination</a>, the <a href="/wiki/SAT" title="SAT">SAT</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Preliminary_SAT" title="Preliminary SAT" class="mw-redirect">PSAT</a>, the <a href="/wiki/ACT_(examination)" title="ACT (examination)">ACT</a>, etc., on every one of which each section correlates to a high degree with the others; the <a href="/wiki/Correlation" title="Correlation">correlation</a> rarely drops below 0.6 on the -1 to 1 scale. In fact, Gardener has downplayed the correlation between his intelligences.</p>
<p>The third major criticism of multiple intelligences as an application in schools is that there is a risk of teachers excusing students from doing well in an area in which they are weak. Students who may not "naturally" learn to read and write well nevertheless need to read and write well. Similarly, the goal is for students to succeed in all areas defined as intelligence by Gardner, and not default to their strengths.</p>
<p>There is an inherent risk of students developing a sense of inferiority in given areas. Students who are identified as not being "musical" learners may have less incentive to become musical learners.</p>
<p>A methodological criticism is that the assessment of one's form of intelligence is usually determined via a self-administered test. The usual form asks the respondent 40-60 questions such as "Do you prefer to stand when working?" This sort of question leaves much room for assessment error, and does not conform to survey techniques and methodology such as <a href="/wiki/Double-blind" title="Double-blind" class="mw-redirect">double-blind</a> testing.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since September 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Another criticism is that the distinction between developmental stage and "intelligence" is not sufficiently well accounted for. For example, the average five-year-old is more likely to answer "yes" to the question "Do you like to move about a lot?" than the average forty-year-old. Conversely, the older person is more likely to seem to have interpersonal "intelligence," which might be better labeled as a developed skill -- solving problems with others or speaking in public, for example.</p>

<p>As one would expect from a theory that redefines <a href="/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a>, one of the major criticisms of the theory is that it is <a href="/wiki/Ad_hoc" title="Ad hoc">ad hoc</a>. The criticism is that <a href="/wiki/Gardner" title="Gardner">Gardner</a> is not expanding the definition of the word "intelligence"; rather, he denies the existence of <a href="/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a>, as is traditionally understood, and instead uses the word "intelligence" whenever other people have traditionally used words like "<a href="/wiki/Ability" title="Ability">ability</a>". This practice has been criticized by <a href="/wiki/Robert_J._Sternberg" title="Robert J. Sternberg" class="mw-redirect">Robert J. Sternberg</a> (1983, 1991), <a href="/wiki/Eysenck" title="Eysenck" class="mw-redirect">Eysenck</a> (1994), and Scarr (1985). Defenders of MI theory argue that the traditional definition of intelligence is too narrow, and thus broader definition more accurately reflects the differing ways in which humans think and learn. They would state that the traditional interpretation of intelligence collapses under the weight of its own logic and definition, noting that intelligence is usually defined as the cognitive or mental capacity of an individual, which by logical necessity would include all forms of mental qualities, not simply the ones most transparent to standardized I.Q. tests.</p>
<p>Some of these criticisms arise from the fact that Gardner has not settled on a single definition of intelligence. He originally defined it as the ability to solve problems that have value in at least one culture, or as something that a student is interested in. However, he added a <a href="/wiki/Disclaimer" title="Disclaimer">disclaimer</a> that he has no fixed definition, and his classification is more of an artistic judgment than fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, it would certainly be desirable to have an <a href="/wiki/Algorithm" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a> for the selection of an intelligence, such that any trained researcher could determine whether a candidate's intelligence met the appropriate criteria. At present, however, it must be admitted that the selection (or rejection) of a candidate's intelligence is reminiscent more of an artistic judgment than of a scientific assessment. (Gardner, <i>Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences</i>, 1985)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gardner argues that by calling linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities intelligences, but not artistic, musical, athletic, etc. abilities, the former are needlessly aggrandized. Many critics balk at this widening of the definition, saying that it ignores "the connotation of intelligence...[which] has always connoted the kind of thinking skills that makes one successful in school."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Gardner writes "I balk at the unwarranted assumption that certain human abilities can be arbitrarily singled out as intelligence while others cannot"<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Critics hold that given this statement, any interest or ability is now redefined as "intelligence". Thus, by adopting this theory, studying intelligence becomes difficult, because it diffuses into the broader concept of ability or talent. Gardner's addition of the naturalistic intelligence and conceptions of the existential and moral intelligences are seen as fruits of this diffusion. Defenders of the MI theory would argue that this is simply a recognition of the broad scope of inherent mental abilities, and that such an exhaustive scope by nature defies a simple, one-dimensional classification such as an assigned IQ value. They would claim that such one-dimensional values are typically of limited value in predicting the real world application of unique mental abilities.</p>

<p>Many critics argue that the theory's definition of intelligence leads to the belief that all human beings are equally intelligent,<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> but in large part this is based on misunderstanding<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since August 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. Gardner argues that there are many different kinds of intelligence and that none is better or more important. However, people have differing abilities within these types of intelligences. <a href="/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> and a person who is good at mathematics both display logical-mathematical intelligence, but at no point does the theory say that all people with the logical-mathematical intelligence are equally intelligent.</p>
<p><a name="Lack_of_empirical_evidence" id="Lack_of_empirical_evidence"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_multiple_intelligences&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18" title="Edit section: Lack of empirical evidence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lack of empirical evidence</span></h4>
<p>Some critics argue that many of Gardner's "intelligences" actually correlate with the <a href="/wiki/General_intelligence_factor" title="General intelligence factor"><i>g</i> factor</a>, supporting the idea of single dominant type of intelligence. For example, Carroll (1993) argued that verbal comprehension, auditory processing, visual perception and ability in logic and mathematics all correlate with each other and are actually subsets of global intelligence. This gives further support for a theory of a single type intelligence.</p>
<p>A critical review of MI theory argues that there is little empirical evidence to support it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To date there have been no published studies that offer evidence of the validity of the multiple intelligences. In 1994 Sternberg reported finding no empirical studies. In 2000 Allix reported finding no empirical validating studies, and at that time Gardner and Connell conceded that there was "little hard evidence for MI theory" (2000, p. 292). In 2004 Sternberg and Grigerenko stated that there were no validating studies for multiple intelligences, and in 2004 Gardner asserted that he would be "delighted were such evidence to accrue" (p. 214), and he admitted that "MI theory has few enthusiasts among psychometricians or others of a traditional psychological background" because they require "psychometric or experimental evidence that allows one to prove the existence of the several intelligences" (2004, p. 214)." (Waterhouse, 2006a, p. 208).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supporters of the MI theory would counter that such dependency is to be expected as this point, as scientific methodology aimed at uncovering intelligence was created under the traditional theory of intelligence, thus leaving a new theory the necessity of initially having to utilize the methodology of the old theory until new modes of scientific inquiry can be developed.</p>
<p>The same review presents evidence to demonstrate that <a href="/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience" title="Cognitive neuroscience">cognitive neuroscience</a> research does not support the theory of Multiple Intelligences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the human brain is unlikely to function via Gardner’s multiple intelligences. Taken together the evidence for the intercorrelations of subskills of IQ measures, the evidence for a shared set of genes associated with mathematics, reading, and g, and the evidence for shared and overlapping “what is it?” and “where is it?” neural processing pathways, and shared neural pathways for language, music, motor skills, and emotions suggest that it is unlikely that that each of Gardner’s intelligences could operate “via a different set of neural mechanisms” (1999, p. 99). Equally important, the evidence for the “what is it?” and “where is it?” processing pathways, for Kahneman’s two decision-making systems, and for adapted cognition modules suggests that these cognitive brain specializations have evolved to address very specific problems in our environment. Because Gardner claimed that that the intelligences are innate potentialities related to a general content area, MI theory lacks a rationale for the phylogenetic emergence of the intelligences." (From Waterhouse, 2006a, p. 213).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A number of articles have surveyed the use of Gardner's ideas and conclude that there is no evidence that his ideas work in practice. Steven A. Stahl found that most of the previous studies which claimed to show positive results had major flaws:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Among others, Marie Carbo claims that her learning styles work is based on research. {I discuss Carbo because she publishes extensively on her model and is very prominent in the workshop circuit...} But given the overwhelmingly negative findings in the published research, I wondered what she was citing, and about a decade ago, I thought it would be interesting to take a look. Reviewing her articles, I found that out of 17 studies she had cited, only one was published. Fifteen were doctoral dissertations and 13 of these came out of one university—St. John’s University in New York, Carbo’s alma mater. None of these had been in a peer-refereed journal. When I looked closely at the dissertations and other materials, I found that 13 of the 17 studies that supposedly support her claim had to do with learning styles based on something other than modality.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>However, the continuing evolution of scientific understanding about the brain and its function suggest further insight into alternative neural pathways and cognitive sources will be likely. (<i>Time</i>, Jan 29, 2007).</p>

<p>The <b>Molly Maguires</b> were members of a secret Irish organization. Many historians believe the "Mollies" were present in the <a href="/wiki/Anthracite_coal" title="Anthracite coal" class="mw-redirect">anthracite coal</a> fields of <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> from approximately the time of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> until a series of sensational arrests and trials in the years 1876âˆ’1878. Evidence that the Molly Maguires were responsible for coalfield crimes and kidnapping in the U.S. rests largely upon allegations of one powerful industrialist, and the testimony of one <a href="/wiki/Pinkerton_National_Detective_Agency" title="Pinkerton National Detective Agency">Pinkerton</a> detective. Fellow prisoners also testified against the alleged Molly Maguires, but some believe these witnesses may have been coerced or bribed.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>There is little doubt that some Irish miners conspired to resist their exploitative conditions; however, the trusts seem to have focused almost exclusively upon the Molly Maguires for criminal prosecution. This may be a consequence of Irish miners acting as the core of militant union activism during a bitter strike provoked by a twenty percent wage reduction. Violence during the period was widespread, with <a href="/wiki/Irish_Catholic" title="Irish Catholic">Irish Catholic</a> miners who reportedly made up the secret organization also falling victim.</p>
<p>Some aspects of the investigations, trials, and executions are unseemly. Information passed from the Pinkerton detective, intended only for the detective agency and their client â€” the most powerful industrialist of the region â€” was apparently also provided to vigilantes who ambushed and murdered miners suspected of being Molly Maguires. The vigilantes did not spare the minersâ€™ families.<sup id="cite_ref-Horan.2C_pp._151-152_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Horan.2C_pp._151-152-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The industrialist standing to gain financially from the destruction of the striking union acted as prosecutor of some of the alleged Molly Maguires at their trials.</p>
<p>Molly history is sometimes presented as the prosecution of an underground movement that was motivated by personal vendettas, and sometimes as a struggle between organized labor and powerful industrial forces.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Whether membership in the Molly organization overlapped union membership to any appreciable extent remains open to conjecture. Much remains uncertain, for the Molly Maguires left virtually no evidence of their existence, and nearly everything that we know about them was written by biased contemporary observers.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Molly_Maguires&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Mollies in Ireland">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mollies in Ireland</span></h2>
<p>The Molly Maguires originated in <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, where secret societies with names such as <a href="/wiki/Whiteboys" title="Whiteboys">Whiteboys</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peep_O%27Day_Boys" title="Peep O'Day Boys">Peep O'Day Boys</a> were common beginning in the 18th century and through most of the 19th century. In <i>Making Sense of the Molly Maguires</i>, historian Kevin Kenny traces "some institutional continuity" from the Molly Maguires, back to the <a href="/wiki/Ribbonism" title="Ribbonism">Ribbonmen</a>, and previously, to the <a href="/wiki/Defenders_(Ireland)" title="Defenders (Ireland)">Defenders</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Another organization â€” the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Order_of_Hibernians" title="Ancient Order of Hibernians">Ancient Order of Hibernians</a> (AOH), with which the Molly Maguires have sometimes been associated â€” was founded in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, and is properly described as a fraternal organization. Although some believe that the <i>Molly Maguires</i>, <i>Ribbonmen</i>, and <i>Ancient Order of Hibernians</i> are different names for the same organization, Kenny has cast some doubt on such linkages, describing the practice of conflating these names as a <i>strategy</i> which "provided an important rationale for [the Molly Maguires'] eventual destruction." Kenny observes that most of the Ireland-based equivalents of the AOH were secret societies, and <i>some</i> were violent. Kenny describes a process of leaders from north-central and northwestern Ireland "[adapting] their AOH lodges to classic 'Ribbonite' purposes."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Even though there was a specific organization called the Society of Ribbonmen, the term <i>Ribbonism</i> became a catchall expression for rural violence in Ireland. The Ancient Order of Hibernians was extended to Ireland by the Ribbonmen, according to the official history of the AOH. Kenny believes, "If the AOH was a transatlantic outgrowth of Ribbonism, it was clearly a peaceful fraternal society rather than a violent conspiratorial one." In some areas the terms <i>Ribbonmen</i> and <i>Molly Maguires</i> were used interchangeably. However, some have drawn distinctions between the Societies of Ribbonmen, who were regarded as "secular, cosmopolitan, and protonationalist," and the Molly Maguires who were "rural, local, and <a href="/wiki/Gaels" title="Gaels">Gaelic</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Agrarian rebellion in Ireland can be traced to local concerns and grievances relating to land usage, particularly as traditional socioeconomic practices such as small-scale potato cultivation were supplanted by the fencing and pasturization of land. Agrarian resistance often took the form of fence destruction, night-time plowing of croplands that had been converted to pasture, and killing, mutilating, or driving off livestock. In areas where the land had long been dedicated to small-scale, growing-season leases of farmland, called <a href="/wiki/Conacre" title="Conacre">conacre</a>, opposition was conceived as "retributive justice" that was intended "to correct transgressions against traditional moral and social codes." The Mollies believed that they were carrying out "a just law of their own in opposition to the inequities of landlord law, the police and court system, and the transgressions of land-grabbers." The Mollies' reaction to "land-grabbers" of the 1840s â€” surreptitiously digging up the land to render it useful only for conacre â€” followed similar practices by Whiteboys in the 1760s, and by another group called the Terry Alts in the 1820s and early 1830s.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One area of Molly Maguire activity was <a href="/wiki/Donegal" title="Donegal">Donegal</a> where they practiced <a href="/wiki/Rundale" title="Rundale">rundale</a>, in which land was divided for tenant usage by the tenants themselves, rather than according to the landowner's dictates. For example, the concept of "a cow's grass" acted as a measure of the land which was necessary to sustain one cow through summer grazing and winter fodder. The subdivision of land took into account the quality of grazing, and while some lots of land were frequently subdivided generationally among family members, other land was <a href="/wiki/Commons" title="Commons" class="mw-redirect">held in common</a>. Although such practices had existed from "time immemorial," there were no written leases to protect the tenants. As landlords implemented new ways of using the land, such as "highly disruptive" experiments with intensive sheep farming, some tenants in Donegal and elsewhere were moved to resistance.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Most landlords and their agents were <a href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant" class="mw-redirect">Protestant</a>, while the Molly Maguires were <a href="/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> â€” an exacerbating factor that complicated relations. The victims of agrarian violence were frequently Irish land agents, middlemen, and tenants. Merchants and millers were often threatened or attacked if their prices were high. Landlords' agents were threatened, beaten, and assassinated. New tenants on lands secured by evictions also became targets. <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Local Molly Maguires leaders were reported to have sometimes dressed as women, representing the Irish mother begging for food for her children. The leader might approach a storekeeper and demand a donation of flour or groceries. If the storekeeper failed to provide, the Molly Maguires would enter the store and take what they wanted, warning the owner of dire consequences if the incident was reported.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>There are a number of folk tales about the source of the Molly Maguires name. Molly may have been a widow who was evicted from her house, inspiring her defenders to form a secret society to exact retribution. Molly Maguire may have been the owner of a <a href="/wiki/Shebeen" title="Shebeen">shebeen</a>, an illicit tavern, where the society met. Another story suggests that Molly Maguire was a fierce young woman who led men through the countryside on nighttime raids.</p>
<p>Kevin Kenny believes that the most likely explanation is simply the practice of men dressing up like women and taking a female name both as a disguise and simple form of social transgression. While the Whiteboys were known to wear white linen frocks over their clothing, the Mollies blackened their faces with burnt cork. Kenny notes similarities â€” particularly in face-blackening and in the donning of women's garments â€” with the practice of <a href="/wiki/Mummers_Play" title="Mummers Play">mummery</a>, in which festive days were celebrated by mummers who travelled from door to door demanding food, money, or drink as payment for a performance. The <i>Threshers</i>, the <i>Peep o'Day Boys</i>, the <i>Lady Rocks</i>, and the <i>Lady Clares</i> also disguised themselves as women.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Many historians believe that Irish immigrants brought a form of the Molly Maguires organization into <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">America</a> in the 19th century, and continued its activities as a clandestine society.

<p>A heritage of agrarian violence in Ireland undoubtedly contributed to the crimes in the <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> coal fields, which continued for well over a decade in the late 19th century. But historian Aleine Austin believes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The facts show that there was much more terror waged against the Mollys than those illiterate Irishmen ever aroused.<sup id="cite_ref-cahn_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cahn-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Although a legitimate self-help organization for Irish immigrants existed in the form of the <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Order_of_Hibernians" title="Ancient Order of Hibernians">Ancient Order of Hibernians</a> (AOH), most mainstream writers accept that the Molly Maguires existed as a secret organization in Pennsylvania, and that they used the AOH as a "front." Yet historians are not even in agreement on this last point. For example, Joseph Rayback's 1966 volume <i>A History of American Labor</i> states that the "identity of the Molly Maguires has never been proved."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Even authors who accept the existence of the Mollies as a violent and destructive group acknowledge a significant scholarship that questions the entire history. In <i>The Pinkerton Story</i>, authors James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett write sympathetically about the detective agency and its mission to bring the Mollies to justice. Yet they observe,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>The difficulty of achieving strict and fair accuracy in relation to the Mollie Maguires is very great. Sensible men have held there never even was such an organization... We do believe, however, that members of a secret organization, bound to each other by oath, used the facilities and personnel of the organization to carry out personal vendettas...</i>"<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Wages were low, working conditions were atrocious, and deaths and serious injuries numbered in the hundreds each year. On September 6, 1869, at the Avondale Mine in <a href="/wiki/Luzerne_County,_Pennsylvania" title="Luzerne County, Pennsylvania">Luzerne County</a>, a fire took the lives of one hundred and ten coal miners.

<p>One of the burning questions for modern scholars is the relationship between the Workingmen's Benevolent Association, the Mollies, and their alleged cover organization, the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Historian Kevin Kenny notes that all of the men who were convicted were members of the AOH. But "the Molly Maguires themselves left virtually no evidence of their existence, let alone their aims and motivation."<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Relying upon his personal knowledge before commencing an investigation, James McParlan believed that the Molly Maguires, under pressure for their activities, had taken the new name "Ancient Order of Hibernians" (AOH). After beginning his investigation, he estimated that there were about 450 members of the AOH in Schuylkill County.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> While Kenny observes that the AOH was "a peaceful fraternal society," he does note that in the 1870s the Pinkerton Agency identified a correlation between the areas of AOH membership in Pennsylvania, and the corresponding areas in Ireland from which those particular Irish immigrants emigrated. The violence-prone areas of Ireland corresponded to the areas of violence in the Pennsylvania coalfields.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In his book <i>Big Trouble</i>, which traces James McParlan's history, Anthony Lukas has written,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The WBA was run by Lancashire men adamantly opposed to violence. But [Gowen] saw an opportunity to paint the union with the Molly brush, which he did in testimony before a state investigating committee... "I do not charge this Workingmen's Benevolent Association with it, but I say there is an association which votes in secret, at night, that men's lives shall be taken... I do not blame this association, but I blame another association for doing it; and it happens that the only men who are shot are the men who dare disobey the mandates of the Workingmen's Benevolent Association."<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the 450 AOH members that Pinkerton Agent McParlan estimated were in Schuylkill County, about 400 belonged to the union.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Yet Kenny observes that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Molly Maguireism and full-fledged trade unionism represented fundamentally different modes of organization and protest.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kenny also notes that one contemporary organization, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Industrial Statistics, clearly distinguished between the union and the violence attributed to the Molly Maguires. Their reports indicate that violence could be traced to the time of the Civil War, but that in the five year existence of the WBA, "the relations existing between employers and employees" had greatly improved. The Bureau concluded that the union had brought an end to the "carnival of crime." Kenny further notes that the leaders of the WBA were "always unequivocally opposed" to the Molly Maguires.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Kenny continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most Irish mine workers belonged to the WBA and roughly half the officers of its executive board in 1872 bore Irish names. But, in addition to the WBA, there existed a loosely organized body of men called the Molly Maguires, whose membership appears to have been exclusively Irish... Both modes of organization... tried to improve conditions of life and labor in the anthracite region. But the strategy of the trade union was indirect, gradual, peaceful, and systematically organized across the anthracite region, while that of the Molly Maguires was direct, violent, sporadic, and confined to a specific locality.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kenny observes that there were frequent tensions between British miners, who held the majority of skilled positions, and the mass of unskilled Irish laborers. However, in spite of such differences, the WBA offered a solution, and for the most part "did a remarkable job" in overcoming such differences.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All mine workers, regardless of craft status, national origin, and religious background, were eligible to join the WBA. As a result, the WBA must have included some "Molly Maguires" among its ranks; many of its rank and file were members of the AOH, and there is evidence that some disgruntled trade union members favored violence against the wishes of their leaders, especially in the climactic year of 1875. But there were no Mollys among the leaders of the WBA, who took every opportunity they could to condemn the Molly Maguires and the use of violence as a strategy in the labor struggle. While the membership of the trade union and the secret society undoubtedly overlapped to some extent, they must be seen as ideologically and institutionally distinct.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the relationship between the WBA and the Molly Maguires, their fates were intertwined â€” at least in part because there were many in positions of power who chose to see no distinctions.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On December 10, 1875, three men and two women were attacked in their house by masked men.

It is not cowardice that makes me resign but just let them have it now I will no longer interfere as I see that one is the same as the other and I am not going to be an accessory to the murder of women and children. I am sure the [Molly Maguires] will not spare the women so long as the Vigilante has shown an example.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>There appears to be an error in the detective's report (which also constituted his resignation letter) of the vigilante incident: he failed to convey the correct number of deaths. James "Friday" O'Donnell and Charles McAllister "were wounded but able to escape."<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> In the note, McParlan reported that these two had been killed by vigilantes. Such notes, possibly containing erroneous or as-yet-unverified information, were forwarded daily by Pinkerton operatives. The content was routinely made available to Pinkerton clients in typed reports.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50" title=""><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>McParlan believed his daily reports had been made available to the anti-Molly vigilantes. Benjamin Franklin, McParlan's Pinkerton supervisor, declared himself "anxious to satisfy [McParlan] that [the Pinkerton Agency has] nothing to do with [the vigilante murders.]" McParlan was prevailed upon not to resign.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51" title=""><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A man named Frank Wenrich, a first lieutenant with the <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania_National_Guard" title="Pennsylvania National Guard">Pennsylvania National Guard</a>, was arrested as the leader of the vigilante attackers, but was released on bail. Then another miner, Hugh McGeehan, a twenty-one year old who had been secretly identified as a killer by McParlan, was fired upon and wounded by unknown assailants.

<p>The state militia and the <a href="/wiki/Coal_and_Iron_Police" title="Coal and Iron Police">Coal and Iron Police</a> patrolled the district. Union leaders were "excoriated by the press," and were "denounced from altar and pulpit." On May 12, John Siney, the union leader who had addressed miners at the Avondale disaster, and who favored arbitration and had opposed the strike, was arrested at a mass meeting called to protest the importation of strike breakers. An organizer for the miners' national association by the name of Xingo Parkes was also arrested, along with twenty-six other union officials, all on a charge of conspiracy. Judge John Holden Owes instructed the jury that,</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The union was nearly broken by the imprisonment of its leadership and by attacks conducted by vigilantes against the strikers. Gowen "deluged the newspapers with stories of murder and arson" committed by the Molly Maguires. The press produced stories of strikes in Illinois, in Jersey City, and in the Ohio mine fields, all inspired by the Mollies. The stories were widely believed.<sup id="cite_ref-bm_53-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bm-53" title=""><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In Schuylkill County the striking miners and their families were starving to death. A striker wrote to a friend,</p>

<p>In his history of the American coal miner, Andrew Roy recorded,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of families rose in the morning to breakfast on a crust of bread and a glass of water, who did not know where a bite of dinner was to come from. Day after day, men, women, and children went to the adjoining woods to dig roots and pick up herbs to keep body and soul together...<sup id="cite_ref-bm_53-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bm-53" title=""><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After six months the strike was defeated and the miners returned to work, accepting the twenty percent cut in pay. But miners belonging to the Ancient Order of Hibernians continued the fight.<sup id="cite_ref-bm3_54-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bm3-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> McParlan acknowledged increasing support for the Mollies in his reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Men, who last winter would not notice a Molly Maguire are now glad to take them by the hand and make much of them. If the bosses exercise tyranny over the men they appear to look to the association for help.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lukas observes that the defeat was humiliating, and traces the roots of Molly violence in the aftermath of the failed strike:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judges, lawyers, and policemen were overwhelmingly Welsh, German, or English... When the coalfield Irish sought to remedy their grievances through the courts, they often met delays, obfuscation, or doors slammed in their faces. No longer looking to these institutions for justice, they turned instead to the Mollies... Before the summer was over, six menâ€”all Welsh or Germanâ€”paid with their lives.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" title=""><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boyer and Morais argue that the killing wasn't all one-sided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Militant miners often disappeared, their bodies sometimes being found later in deserted mine shafts.<sup id="cite_ref-bm3_54-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bm3-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>After months of little progress, McParlan reported some plans by the "inner circle." Gomer James, a Welshman, had shot and wounded one of the Mollies, and plans were formulated for a revenge killing. But the wheels of revenge were grinding slowly. And there was other violence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>November was a bloody month what with the miners on strike... In the three days around November 18, a Mollie was found dead in the streets of Carbondale, north of Scranton, a man had his throat cut, an unidentified man was crucified in the woods, a mining boss mauled, a man murdered in Scranton, and three men of [another Molly Maguires group] were guilty of a horror against an old woman, and an attempt to assassinate a Mollie, Dougherty, followed and [Dougherty] at once demanded the murder of W.M.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the last day of the month, with Gowen's strikebreakers pouring in, the Summit telegraph office was burned, a train derailed, and McParlan advised [his Pinkerton supervisor] to send in uniformed police to preserve order.<sup id="cite_ref-horan2_57-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-horan2-57" title=""><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A plan to destroy a railroad bridge was abandoned due to the presence of outsiders. The Irish had been forbidden by the English and Welsh to set foot in a public square in Mahanoy City, and a plan for the Irish to occupy it by force of arms was considered then abandoned.</p>
<p>In the meantime a messenger reported that Thomas, the would-be killer of one of the Mollies, had been killed in the stable where he worked. McParlan reported that he, McParlan, had been asked to supply the hidden killers with food and whiskey. Horan and Swiggett write,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The probability is that as a man, Bully Bill Thomas, a Welshman, was no better than his enemies, but he was remarkable in other ways.

<p>Another plan was in the works, this one against two night watchmen, Pat McCarron and <a href="http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=17793" class="external text" title="http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=17793" rel="nofollow">Borough Patrolman Benjamin Yost</a>. Accused Mollies Jimmy Kerrigan and Thomas Duffy were said to despise Yost, who had arrested them numerous times. Yost was shot as he put out a street light, which at that time necessitated climbing the lamp pole. Before he died, he reported that his killers were Irish, but were not Kerrigan or Duffy.</p>
<p>McParlan recorded that a Molly by the name of William Love killed a justice of the peace by the name of Gwyther in <a href="/wiki/Girardville,_Pennsylvania" title="Girardville, Pennsylvania">Girardville</a>. Unknown Mollies were accused of wounding a man outside his saloon in <a href="/wiki/Shenandoah,_Pennsylvania" title="Shenandoah, Pennsylvania">Shenandoah</a>.

<p>When Franklin Gowen first hired the Pinkerton agency, he had claimed the Molly Maguires were so powerful they had made capital and labor "their puppets."<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title=""><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup> When the trials of the alleged puppet-masters opened, Gowen had himself appointed as special prosecutor. <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The first trial of defendants McGeehan, Carroll, Duffy, James Boyle, and James Roarity for the killing of Benjamin Yost commenced in May, 1876. Yost had not recognized the men who attacked him. Although Kerrigan has since been described, along with Duffy, as hating the night watchman enough to plot his murder,<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> Kerrigan became a state's witness and testified against the union leaders and other miners. However, Kerrigan's wife testified in the courtroom that her husband had committed the murder. She testified that she refused to provide her husband with clothing while he was in prison, because he had "picked innocent men to suffer for his crime." She stated that her speaking out was voluntary, and that she was interested only in telling the truth about the murder. Gowen cross-examined her, but could not shake her testimony. Others supported her testimony amid speculation that Kerrigan was receiving special treatment due to the fact that James McParlan was engaged to his sister-in-law, Mary Ann Higgins.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64" title=""><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> This trial was declared a mistrial due to the death of one of the jurors. A new trial was granted two months later. During that trial Fanny Kerrigan did not testify. The five defendants were sentenced to death. Kerrigan was allowed to go free.</p>
<p>The trial of Tom Munley for the murder of mine foreman Thomas Sanger and his friend, William Uren, relied entirely upon the testimony of James McParlan, and the eyewitness account of a witness. The witness stated under oath that he had seen the murderer clearly, and that Munley was not the murderer. Yet the jury accepted McParlan's testimony that Munley had privately confessed to the murder.

<p>Another four miners were put on trial and were found guilty on a charge of murder. The testimony against them came from only two sources: James McParlan, and "Kelly the Bum." McParlan had no direct evidence, but had recorded that the four admitted their guilt to him. Kelly the Bum was being held in a cell for murder, and he had been quoted, "I would squeal on Jesus Christ to get out of here." In return for his testimony, the murder charge against him was dismissed.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66" title=""><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In November McAllister was convicted.</p>
<p>McParlan's testimony in the Molly Maguires trials helped to send ten men to the gallows. The defense attorneys repeatedly sought to portray McParlan as an agent-provocateur who was responsible for not warning people of their imminent deaths. (Kenny 232-33) For his part, McParlan testified that the AOH and the Mollys were one and the same, and that the defendants were guilty of the murders. (Kenny 234-5)</p>

A scaffold had been erected in the Carbon County prison. State militia with fixed bayonets surrounded the prisons and the scaffolds. Miners arrived with their wives and children from the surrounding areas, walking through the night to honor the accused, and by nine o'clock "the crowd in Pottsville stretched as far as one could see." The families were silent, which was "the people's way of paying tribute" to those about to die. Tom Munley's aged father had walked more than ten miles (16&#160;km) from <a href="/wiki/Gilberton,_Pennsylvania" title="Gilberton, Pennsylvania">Gilberton</a> to assure his son that he believed in his innocence. Munley's wife had arrived a few minutes after they closed the gate, and they refused to open it even for close relatives to say their final good-byes. She screamed at the gate with grief, throwing herself against it until she collapsed, but she was not allowed to pass.</p>
<p>Four members of the Molly Maguires, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Campbell_(businessman)" title="Alexander Campbell (businessman)">Alexander Campbell</a>, John "Black Jack" Kehoe, Michael Doyle and Edward Kelly, were hanged on June 21, 1877 at a Carbon County prison in Mauch Chunk (renamed <a href="/wiki/Jim_Thorpe,_Pennsylvania" title="Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania">Jim Thorpe</a> in 1953), for the murder of mine bosses John P. Jones and Morgan Powell, following a trial that was later described by a Carbon County judge, John P. Lavelle, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Molly Maguire trials were a surrender of state sovereignty. A private corporation initiated the investigation through a private detective agency. A private police force arrested the alleged defenders, and private attorneys for the coal companies prosecuted them.

</blockquote>
<p>Allegedly, Alexander Campbell, just before his execution, slapped a muddy handprint on his cell wall stating "There is proof of my words. That mark of mine will never be wiped out. It will remain forever to shame the county for hanging an innocent man." Despite many efforts to remove the mark, including tearing down and rebuilding the wall, the handprint remains in the same spot.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>Many accounts of the Molly Maguires that were written during, or shortly after, the period offer no admission that there was widespread violence in the area, that vigilantism existed, nor that violence was carried out <i>against</i> the miners.</p>
<p>In 1910, industrialist and historian <a href="/wiki/James_Ford_Rhodes" title="James Ford Rhodes">James Ford Rhodes</a> published a major scholarly analysis in the leading professional history journal:<sup id="cite_ref-AHArticle_69-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AHArticle-69" title=""><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>Many of the Mollies were miners and the mode of working the mines lent itself to their peculiar policy. Miners were paid by the cubic yard, by the mine car, or by the ton, and (in the driving of entries) by the lineal yard. In the assignment of places, which was made by the mining boss, there were "soft" jobs and hard. If a Molly applied for a soft job and was refused, his anger was aroused and not infrequently in due time the offending boss was murdered. If he got employment, there was a constant chance of disagreement in measuring-up the work and in estimating the quality of the coal mined, for it was the custom to dock the miners' wages for bad coal with too much slate and dirt, and a serious disagreement was apt to be followed by violence. Little wonder was it that, as the source of the outrages was well understood, mining bosses refused to employ Irishmen, but this did not ensure their safety, as they might then be murdered for their refusal. A good Superintendent of any colliery would, in his quality of superior officer, support an efficient mining boss and would thus fall under the ban himself. John T. Morse, Jr., who made a contemporaneous study of the Molly Maguires, wrote in his vivid account of their operations: "The superintendents and 'bosses' in the collieries could all rest assured that their days would not be long in the land. Everywhere and at all times they were attacked, beaten, and shot down, by day and by night; month after month and year after year, on the public highways and in their own homes, in solitary places and in the neighborhood of crowds, these doomed men continued to fall in frightful succession beneath the hands of assassins."<sup id="cite_ref-AmerLaw_70-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AmerLaw-70" title=""><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup><br />
<br />
The murders were not committed in the heat of sudden passion for some fancied wrong: they were the result of a deliberate system. The wronged individual laid his case before a quasijudicial tribunal demanding the death, say, of a mining boss and urging his reasons. If they were satisfactory, as they usually were, the murder was decreed; but the task was not assigned to the aggrieved person or to any one in his and the victim's neighborhood: perhaps directly-aggrieved parties might be tempted to use more force or more cruelty than necessary. Two or more relatively disinterested Mollies from a different part of the county or even from the adjoining county were selected to do the killing because, being unknown, they could the more easily escape detection. Refusal to carry out the dictate of the conclave was dangerous and seldom happened, although an arrangement of substitution, if properly supported, was permitted. The meeting generally took place in an upper room of a hotel or saloon and, after the serious business, came the social reunion with deep libations of whiskey.<br />
<br />
In attempting to give precise figures, some writers have undoubtedly exaggerated the number of murders by this order from 1865 to 1875; but no one can go through the evidence without being convinced that a great many men were killed to satisfy the vengeful spirit of the Molly Maguires. Some of the victims were men so useful, so conspicuous, and so beloved in their communities that their assassinations caused a profound and enduring impression. In some cases, so Dewees (who has written a very useful story<sup id="cite_ref-Dewees_71-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dewees-71" title=""><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup>) asserts, robbery was added to murder: superintendents, who were carrying the money for the monthly pay of the miners and laborers, were waylaid as they drove along some lonely road in the desolate country. While the murders were numerous, still more numerous were the threats of murder and warnings to leave the country written on a sheet of paper with a rude picture of a coffin or a pistol and sometimes both. One notice read: "Mr. John Taylor â€” We will give you one week to go, but if you are alive on next Saturday you will die." Another, to three bosses, charged with "cheating thy men" had a picture of three pistols and a coffin and on the coffin was written, "This is your home."<sup id="cite_ref-Dewees2_72-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dewees2-72" title=""><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup> In other mining districts and in manufacturing localities, during strikes and times of turbulence similar warnings have been common and have been laughed at by mining bosses, superintendents, and proprietors; but, in the anthracite region between 1865 and 1876 the bravest of men could not forget how many of his fellows had been shot and suppress a feeling of uneasiness when he found such a missive on his doorstep or posted up on the door of his office at the mine. Many a superintendent and mining boss left his house in the morning with his hand on his revolver, wondering if he would ever see wife and children again.<br />
<br />
The young men of the order were selected for the commission of murder; above them were older heads holding high office and, in a variety of ways, displaying executive ability. They were quick to see what a weapon to their hand was universal suffrage, and, with the aptitude for politics which the Irish have shown in our country, they developed their order into a political power to be reckoned with. Numbering in Schuylkill county only 500 or 600 out of 5,000 Irishmen in a total population of 116,000,<sup id="cite_ref-Cen1870_73-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cen1870-73" title=""><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> the Molly Maguires controlled the common schools and the local government of the townships in the mining sections of the county. They elected at different times three county commissioners and came near electing one of their number, who had acquired twenty thousand dollars worth of property, Associate Judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. In one borough a Molly was Chief of Police; another in Mahanoy township, Jack Kehoe, was High Constable.<sup id="cite_ref-Dewees3_74-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dewees3-74" title=""><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup> In the elections were fraudulent voting, stuffing of the ballot-boxes and false returns; in the administration of the offices, fraud and robbery. In Mahanoy township, $60,000 were drawn for the schools and eleven-twelfths of it stolen. Exorbitant road taxes were a fruitful means by which township officials robbed the taxpayers and put the money in their own pockets. In August 1875 an ex-county commissioner, a Molly, and two commissioners then in office, not actually belonging to the order but in sympathy with it, had been convicted of stealing the county funds and each had been sentenced by a full bench [September 6] to two years' imprisonment. At the fall election for governor in this year [1875] the Molly Maguires, who were naturally Democrats, foresaw Republican success and sold their vote in Schuylkill and Luzerne counties to the Republicans for a certain amount of money in hand and an implied agreement that these convicted commissioners and other criminals who were called by a leading Molly "our men" should be pardoned.<sup id="cite_ref-Elections_75-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Elections-75" title=""><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup> It is hardly to be supposed that the Republican politicians who made this bargain were aware of the thoroughly criminal nature of the Molly Maguires, for they had astutely covered themselves with a virtuous cloak, securing from the Legislature in 1871 a charter for the Ancient Order of Hibernians whose motto was "Friendship, Unity and Christian Charity." On October 10, 1875, in a letter to the Shenandoah <i>Herald</i> Jack Kehoe denied with indignation that the Molly Maguires were synonymous with the Ancient Order of Hibernians, which latter was "composed of men who are law abiding and seek the elevation of their members."<sup id="cite_ref-Dewees4_76-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dewees4-76" title=""><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup> Kehoe was crafty enough to see the advantage of throwing dust in the eyes of the public and, when the outside world was bargained with, the A.O.H. was put forward; but, as matter of fact, it was the old story of ravening wolves in sheep's clothing.<sup id="cite_ref-passage_77-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-passage-77" title=""><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup><br />

<p>Some have declared unequivocally that justice was done. An industrial spokesman proclaimed after the last trial,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peace once more reigns in the anthracite coal regions. Mollie Maguireism is practically dead. The inhabitants of the anthracite coal regions are now enjoying the blessed peace which has recently come to them. God rules, justice must reign, and right must triumph.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78" title=""><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others do not seem so certain. Horan and Swiggett, ever supportive of the Pinkerton cause that is the subject of their book, declare that "evil men had conspired for years to do evil things and the law had at last overtaken them." Yet a footnote suggests that their verdict concerning the trials that condemned the Molly Maguires is heavily qualified. They write, "There was much, of course, in the practices and outlook of the times which is abhorrent today." The footnote to this observation explains,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the trials, special assistants to the district attorneys were supplied by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, the Lehigh and Wilkes Barre, and the Lehigh Valley. Professor Schlegel in his <i>Ruler of the Reading</i> (1947) calls "the Mollie trials and their aftermath among the least creditable incidents of [Gowen's] life." Professors Allan Nevins and Henry Steele Commager of Columbia University, both distinguished scholars, concur in the veracity and soundness of Professor Schlegel's research and conclusions.<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79" title=""><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Horan and Swiggett also note that others have argued,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...punishment had gone too far, and that the guilt of some of the condemned was that of association more than participation and but half established by other condemned men seeking clemency for themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-horan3_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-horan3-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boyer and Morais wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McParlan agreed to testify, and did testify, that all those whom Gowan wanted removed had freely and voluntarily confessed to him that they had committed various murders. His word was to be corroborated by various prisoners at various of the county's jails, freedom the reward for corroboration. Among those who buttressed McParlan's testimony at the ensuing trials was a prisoner known as Kelly the Bum, who admitted that he had committed every crime in the calendar. This person was another prisoner was one Jimmy Kerrigan whose wife testified that he himself had committed the murder with which he was charging the miners of the AOH.<sup id="cite_ref-bm3_54-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bm3-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joseph G. Rayback, author of <i>A History of American Labor</i>, has observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The charge has been made that the Molly Maguires episode was deliberately manufactured by the coal operators with the express purpose of destroying all vestiges of unionism in the area... There is some evidence to support the charge... the "crime wave" that appeared in the anthracite fields came after the appearance of the Pinkertons, and... many of the victims of the crimes were union leaders and ordinary miners. The evidence brought against [the defendants], supplied by James McParlan, a Pinkerton, and corroborated by men who were granted immunity for their own crimes, was tortuous and contradictory, but the net effect was damning... The trial temporarily destroyed the last vestiges of labor unionism in the anthracite area. More important, it gave the public the impression... that miners were by nature criminal in character...<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80" title=""><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The union point of view is expressed by the <i>Miners' Journal</i> of June 22, 1877, which asked simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What did they do? Whenever prices of labor did not suit them, they organized to proclaim a strike.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81" title=""><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Formulated the movement's ideology and <i>Supreme Commander</i> of the Etzel</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Members of the Irgun came mostly from <a href="/wiki/Betar" title="Betar">Beitar</a> and from the <a href="/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism" title="Revisionist Zionism">Revisionist Party</a> both in Palestine and abroad. The Revisionist Movement made up a popular backing for the underground organization. <a href="/wiki/Ze%27ev_Jabotinsky" title="Ze'ev Jabotinsky">Ze'ev Jabotinsky</a>, founder of Revisionist Zionism, was the commander of the organization until he died. He formulated the general realm of operation, regarding <i><a href="/wiki/Havlagah" title="Havlagah">Restraint</a></i> and the end thereof, and was the inspiration for the organization overall. An additional major source of idealogical inspiration was the poetry of <a href="/wiki/Uri_Zvi_Greenberg" title="Uri Zvi Greenberg">Uri Zvi Greenberg</a>. The symbol of the organization, with the motto רק כך (Only Thus), alongside a hand holding a rifle in the foreground of all of mandatory Palestine (both sides of the <a href="/wiki/Jordan_River" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a>), symbolized the striving for Hebrew independence over the entire land of Israel, to be achieved only by the power of "Jewish weapons".</p>
<p>The number of members of the Irgun varied from a few hundred to a few thousand. Most of its members were people who accepted the organization's command, under which they carried out various operations and filled positions, largely in opposition to <a href="/wiki/British_law" title="British law" class="mw-redirect">British law</a>. Most of them were "ordinary" people, who held regular jobs, and only a few dozen worked full time in the Irgun.</p>
<p>The Irgun disagreed with the policy of the <a href="/wiki/Yishuv" title="Yishuv">Yishuv</a> and with the <a href="/wiki/World_Zionist_Organization" title="World Zionist Organization">World Zionist Organization</a>, both with regard to strategy and basic ideology and with regard to PR and military tactics, such as use of force for Zionist ends, attitude towards the Arabs during the riots, and relations with the British mandatory government. Therefore the Irgun tended to ignore the decisions made by the Zionist leadership and the Yishuv's institutions. This fact caused the elected bodies not to recognize the independent organization, and during most of the time of its existence the organization was seen as irresponsible, and its actions thus worthy of thwarting. Therefore the Irgun accompanied its armed operations with public relations campaigns, in order to convince the public of the Irgun's way and the problems with the official political leadership of the Yishuv. The Irgun put out numerous advertisements, an underground newspaper and even ran the first independent Hebrew radio station - <a href="/wiki/Kol_TSion_HaLokhemet" title="Kol TSion HaLokhemet">Kol Zion HaLochemet</a>.</p>

<p>As an underground organization, members did not normally call it by its name, rather used other names. In the first years of its existence it was known primarily as "ההגנה הלאומית" (the National Haganah), and also by names such as "Irgun Bet", "Haganah Bet", the "Parallel Organization" and the "Rightwing Organization". Later on it was most widely known as "המעמד" (the Stand). The anthem adopted by the Irgun was "Anonymous Soldiers",<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> written by <a href="/wiki/Avraham_Stern" title="Avraham Stern">Avraham (Yair) Stern</a> who was at the time a commander in the Irgun. Later on Stern defected from the Irgun and founded <a href="/wiki/Lehi_(group)" title="Lehi (group)">Lehi</a>, and the song became the anthem of the Lehi. The Irgun's new anthem then became the third verse of the "Beitar Song", by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.</p>
<p>In August 1933 a "Supervisory Committee" for the Irgun was established, which included representatives from most of the Zionist political parties. The members of this committee were <a href="/w/index.php?title=Meir_Grossman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Meir Grossman (page does not exist)">Meir Grossman</a> (of the Hebrew State Party), <a href="/wiki/Meir_Bar-Ilan" title="Meir Bar-Ilan">Rabbi Meir Bar Ilan</a> (of the <a href="/wiki/Mizrachi_(Religious_Zionism)" title="Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)">Mizrachi Party</a>, either <a href="/w/index.php?title=Immanuel_Neumann&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Immanuel Neumann (page does not exist)">Immanuel Neumann</a> or <a href="/w/index.php?title=Yehoshua_Supersky&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yehoshua Supersky (page does not exist)">Yehoshua Supersky</a> (of the <a href="/wiki/General_Zionists" title="General Zionists">General Zionists</a>) and <a href="/wiki/Ze%27ev_Jabotinsky" title="Ze'ev Jabotinsky">Ze'ev Jabotinsky</a> or <a href="/w/index.php?title=Eliyahu_Ben_Horin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Eliyahu Ben Horin (page does not exist)">Eliyahu Ben Horin</a> (of <a href="/wiki/Hatzohar" title="Hatzohar">Hatzohar</a>). The committee was in charge of the Irgun until 1937, when the movement split yet again. From that point on, the Irgun was under Jabotinsky's command. After his death ties were formed between the Irgun and the <a href="/wiki/New_Zionist_Organization" title="New Zionist Organization">New Zionist Organization</a>. These ties were broken in 1944 when the Irgun declared war on the <a href="/wiki/British_government" title="British government" class="mw-redirect">British government</a>.</p>
<p>Within the Irgun, <a href="/wiki/Avraham_Tehomi" title="Avraham Tehomi">Avraham Tehomi</a> was the first to serve as "Head of the Headquarters" or "Chief Commander". Alongside Tehomi served the "Headquarters". When the movement expanded, districts were laid out within the movement. A local Irgun unit was called a "Branch". A "Brigade" in the Irgun was made up of three sections. A section was made up of two groups, at the head of each was a "Group Head", and a deputy. Later on various newer units were established, who answered to a "Center" or "Staff"). Ranks were put into use later on and were (in ascending order) Deputy, Group Head, Sergeant (for a Section), Sergeant A (Brigade), First Sergeant (Battalion); officer ranks were "Gundar" (District of Unit Commander) and First Gundar (Senior Commander). A rank of Major was awarded to the Irgun commander <a href="/wiki/Yaakov_Meridor" title="Yaakov Meridor">Yaakov Meridor</a> and a rank of Major General (<a href="/wiki/Aluf" title="Aluf">Aluf</a>) to <a href="/wiki/David_Raziel" title="David Raziel">David Raziel</a>. Until his death in 1940, Jabotinsky was known as the "Military Commander of the Etzel" or the "Supreme Commander".</p>
<p>The military nature of the organization manifested itself in two ways. First, was the execution of strict drill exercises, carrying out of ceremonies at different times, and strict attention given to discipline, formal ceremonies and military relationships between the various ranks. Another way the military nature was apparent was the organized training regime. The Irgun trained with handguns and submachine guns, hand grenade throwing, and combined attacks on targets. The Irgun put out professional publications on combat doctrine, weaponry, leadership, drill exercises, etc. Among these publications were the 240-page book "The Gun" by <a href="/wiki/David_Raziel" title="David Raziel">David Raziel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Avraham_(Yair)_Stern" title="Avraham (Yair) Stern" class="mw-redirect">Avraham (Yair) Stern</a>, and the 284-page book "The Compiled and Expanded Guide to Drill Exercises" by David Raziel. Up until the <a href="/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine" title="1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine">Arab Revolt of 1936-1939</a> the Haganah also made use of these guidebooks (afterwards the Haganah published its own military literature).</p>
<p>Until <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> the Irgun was able to arm itself by weapons purchased in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, primarily <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, and smuggled to Palestine. The Irgun also established workshops that manufactured spare parts and attachments for the weapons. Also manufactured were land mines and simple hand grenades. Another way in which the Irgun armed itself was "Confiscations" - stealing weapons from the <a href="/wiki/Palestine_Police" title="Palestine Police" class="mw-redirect">British police</a> and military.</p>

<p>The Irgun's first steps were in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/1929_Palestine_riots" title="1929 Palestine riots">Riots of 1929</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> branch of the Haganah there were feelings of disappointment and internal unrest towards the leadership of the movements and the <a href="/wiki/Histadrut" title="Histadrut">Histadrut</a> (at that time the organization running the Haganah). These feelings were a result of the view that the Haganah had failed after ten years of existence in the face of murders, violence, property vandalism and Jewish abandonment of settlements and neighborhoods in light of outlaws' violence and local Arab gangs towards Jews. Likewise, critics of the leadership spoke out against alleged failures in the amount of weapons, readiness of the movement and its policy of restraint and not fighting back. On April 10, 1931, commanders and equipment managers announced that they refuse to return weapons to the Haganah that had been issued to them earlier, prior to the Nebi Musa holiday. These weapons were later returned by the commander of the Jerusalem branch, Abraham Tehomi, aka "Gideon". However, the commanders who decided to rebel against the leadership of the Haganah relayed a message regarding their resignations to the <a href="/wiki/Vaad_Leumi" title="Vaad Leumi" class="mw-redirect">Vaad Leumi</a>, and thus this schism created a new independent movement.</p>
<p>At the helm of the new underground movement stood Abraham Tehomi, alongside other founding members who were all senior commanders in the Haganah, members of the Young Labor Party and of the Histadrut. Also among them was Eliyahu Ben Horin, an activist in the <a href="/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism" title="Revisionist Zionism">Revisionist Party</a>. This group was known as the "Odessan Gang", because they previously had been members of the <i>Haganah Ha'Atzmit</i> of Jewish <a href="/wiki/Odessa" title="Odessa">Odessa</a>. The new movement was named <i>Irgun Tsvai Leumi</i>, ("National Military Organization") in order to emphasize its active nature in contrast to the Haganah. Moreover, the organization was founded with the desire to become a true military organization and not just a militia as the Haganah was at the time.</p>
<p>In the autumn of that year the Jerusalem group merged with other armed groups affiliated with <a href="/wiki/Betar" title="Betar">Beitar</a>. The Beitar groups' center of activity was in <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, and they began their activity in 1928 with the establishment of "Officers and Instructors School of Beitar". Students at this institution had broken away from the Haganah earlier, for political reasons, and the new group called itself the "National Defense", הגנה הלאומית. During the riots of 1929 Beitar youth participated in the defense of Tel Aviv neighborhoods under the command of Yermiyahu Halperin, at the behest of the Tel Aviv city hall. After the riots the Tel Avivian group expanded, and was known as "The <a href="/wiki/Right_Wing" title="Right Wing" class="mw-redirect">Right Wing</a> Organization".</p>
<p>After the Tel Aviv expansion another branch was established in <a href="/wiki/Haifa" title="Haifa">Haifa</a>. Towards the end of 1932 the Haganah branch of <a href="/wiki/Safed" title="Safed">Safed</a> also defected and joined the Irgun, as well as many members of the <a href="/wiki/Maccabi_World_Union" title="Maccabi World Union">Maccabi</a> sports association. At that time the movement's underground newsletter, <i>Ha'Metsudah</i> (the Tower) also began publication, expressing the active trend of the movement. The Irgun also increased its numbers by expanding draft regiments of Beitar - groups of volunteers, committed to two years of security and pioneer activities. These regiments were based in places that from which stemmed new Irgun strongholds in the many places, including the settlements of <a href="/wiki/Yesod_HaMa%27ala" title="Yesod HaMa'ala" class="mw-redirect">Yesod HaMa'ala</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mishmar_HaYarden" title="Mishmar HaYarden">Mishmar HaYarden</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rosh_Pinna" title="Rosh Pinna">Rosh Pina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metula" title="Metula">Metula</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nahariya" title="Nahariya">Nahariya</a> in the north; in the center - <a href="/wiki/Hadera" title="Hadera">Hadera</a>, <a href="/wiki/Binyamina" title="Binyamina">Binyamina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herzliya" title="Herzliya">Herzliya</a>, <a href="/wiki/Netanya" title="Netanya">Netanya</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kfar_Sava" title="Kfar Sava" class="mw-redirect">Kfar Sava</a>, and south of there - <a href="/wiki/Rishon_LeZion" title="Rishon LeZion">Rishon LeZion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rehovot" title="Rehovot">Rehovot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ness_Ziona" title="Ness Ziona">Ness Ziona</a>. Later on regiments were also active in the <a href="/wiki/Old_City_of_Jerusalem" title="Old City of Jerusalem" class="mw-redirect">Old City of Jerusalem</a> ("the Kotel Brigades") among others. Primary training centers were based in <a href="/wiki/Ramat_Gan" title="Ramat Gan">Ramat Gan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Qastina" title="Qastina">Qastina</a> (by <a href="/wiki/Kiryat_Mal%27akhi" title="Kiryat Mal'akhi" class="mw-redirect">Kiryat Mal'akhi</a> of today) and other places.</p>

<p>In 1933 there some signs of unrest, seen by the incitement of the local Arab leadership to act against the authorities. The strong British response put down the disturbances quickly. During that time the Irgun operated in a similar manner to the Haganah and was a guarding organization. The two organizations cooperated in ways such as coordination of posts and even intelligence sharing.</p>
<p>In protest against, and with the aim of ending <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jewish_immigration_to_Palestine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jewish immigration to Palestine (page does not exist)">Jewish immigration to Palestine</a>, the <a href="/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine" title="1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine">Great Arab Revolt of 1936-1939</a> broke out on April 19, 1936. The riots took the form of attacks by Arab rioters ambushing main roads, bombing of roads and settlements as well as property and agriculture vandalism. In the beginning, the Irgun and the Haganah generally maintained a policy of restraint, apart from a few instances. Some expressed resentment at this policy, leading up internal unrest in the two organizations. The Irgun tended to retaliate more often, and sometimes Irgun members patrolled areas beyond their positions in order to encounter attackers ahead of time. However, there were differences of opinion regarding what to do in the Haganah, as well. Due to the joining of many <a href="/wiki/Beitar" title="Beitar" class="mw-redirect">Beitar</a> Youth members, Jabotinsky (founder of Beitar) had a great deal of influence over Irgun policy. Nevertheless, Jabotinsky was of the opinion that for moral reasons violent retaliation was not to be undertaken.</p>
<p>During the first stage of the Revolt, from April 1936 until October of that year, 80 Jews were killed, 369 were injured, 19 schools were attacked, nine orphanages and three old-age homes. 380 attacks on trains and buses were carried out, and approximately 4,000 acres (16&#160;km²) of agricultural land were destroyed. These actions were carried out by armed Arab gangs who were joined by <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syrian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraqi</a> reinforcements. The <a href="/w/index.php?title=Supreme_Arab_Committee&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Supreme Arab Committee (page does not exist)">Supreme Arab Committee</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/Mohammad_Amin_al-Husayni" title="Mohammad Amin al-Husayni">Haj Amin al-Husayni</a>, who directed these riots, also declared a <a href="/wiki/General_strike" title="General strike">general strike</a> on labor and trade. In the beginning of October 1936 gang activity declined due to the intervention of the <a href="/wiki/British_army" title="British army" class="mw-redirect">British army</a>.</p>
<p>In November 1936 the <a href="/wiki/Peel_Commission" title="Peel Commission">Peel Commission</a> was sent to inquire regarding the breakout of the riots and propose a solution to end the Revolt. In early 1937 there were still some in the <a href="/wiki/Yishuv" title="Yishuv">Yishuv</a> who felt the commission would recommend a partition of the land west of the <a href="/wiki/Jordan_River" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a>, thus creating a Jewish state on part of the land. The Irgun leadership, as well as the "Supervisory Committee" held similar beliefs, as did some members of the Haganah and the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency" title="Jewish Agency" class="mw-redirect">Jewish Agency</a>. This belief strengthened the policy of <a href="/wiki/Havlagah" title="Havlagah">restraint</a> and led to the position that there was no room for defense institutions in the future Jewish state. Tehomi was quoted as saying: "We stand before great events: a Jewish state and a Jewish army. There is a need for a single military force". This position intensified the differences of opinion regarding the policy of restraint, both within the Irgun and within the political camp aligned with the organization. The leadership committee of the Irgun supported a merger with the Haganah. On April 24, 1937 a referendum was held among Irgun members regarding its continued independent existence. David Raziel and Avraham (Yair) Stern came out publicly in support for the continued existence of the Irgun:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Irgun has been placed... before a decision to make, whether to submit to the authority of the government and the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Agency" title="Jewish Agency" class="mw-redirect">Jewish Agency</a> or to prepare for a double sacrifice and endangerment. Some of our friends do not have appropriate willingness for this difficult position, and have submitted to the Jewish Agency and has left the battle... all of the attempts... to unite with the leftist organization have failed, because the Left entered into negotiations not on the basis of unification of forces, but the submission of one such force to the other...</i><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>In April 1937 the Irgun split after the referendum. Approximately 1,500-2,000 people, about half of the Irgun's membership, including the senior command staff, regional committee members, along with most of the Irgun's weapons, returned to the Haganah, which at that time was under the Jewish Agency's leadership. In their opinion, in order to remove the Haganah from the Jewish Agency's leadership to the national institutions necessitated their return. Furthermore, they no longer saw significant ideological differences between the movements. Those who remained in the Irgun were primarily young activists, mostly laypeople, who sided with the independent existence of the Irgun. In fact, most of those who remained were originally Beitar people. Moshe Rosenberg estimated that approximately 1,800 members remained. In theory, the Irgun remained an organization not aligned with a political party, but in reality the supervisory committee was disbanded and the Irgun's continued ideological path was outlined according to Ze'ev Jabotinsky's school of thought and his decisions, until the movement eventually became Revisionist Zionism's military arm. One of the major changes in policy by Jabotinsky was the end of the policy of <a href="/wiki/Havlagah" title="Havlagah">restraint</a>.</p>
<p>On April 27, 1937 the Irgun founded a new headquarters, staffed by Moshe Rosenberg at the head, <a href="/wiki/Avraham_Stern" title="Avraham Stern">Avraham (Yair) Stern</a> as secretary, David Raziel as head of the Jerusalem branch, Hanoch Kalai as commander of Haifa and Aharon Haichman as commander of Tel Aviv. On the 20th of <a href="/wiki/Tammuz_(month)" title="Tammuz (month)">Tammuz</a>, (June 29) the day of <a href="/wiki/Theodor_Herzl" title="Theodor Herzl">Theodor Herzl's</a> death, a ceremony was held in honor of the reorganization of the underground movement. For security purposes this ceremony was held at a construction site in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Ze'ev Jabotinsky placed Col. Robert Bitker at the head of the Irgun. Bitker had previously served as Beitar commissioner in China and had military experience. A few months later, probably due to total incompatibility with the position, Jabotinsky replaced Bitker with Moshe Rosenberg. When the <a href="/wiki/Peel_Commission" title="Peel Commission">Peel Commission</a> report was published a few months later, the Revisionist camp decided not to accept the commission's recommendations. Moreover, the organizations of Beitar, <a href="/wiki/Hatzohar" title="Hatzohar">Hatzohar</a> and the Irgun began to increase their efforts to bring Jews to the land of Israel, illegally. This <a href="/wiki/Aliyah" title="Aliyah">Aliyah</a> was known as the עליית אף על פי "Af Al Pi (Nevertheless) Aliyah". As opposed to this position, the Jewish Agency began acting on behalf of the Zionist interest on the political front, and continued the policy of restraint. From this point onwards the differences between the Haganah and the Irgun were much more obvious.</p>

<p>According to Jabotinsky's "Evacuation Plan", which called for millions of European Jews to be brought to Palestine at once, the Irgun helped the <a href="/wiki/Aliyah_Bet" title="Aliyah Bet">illegal immigration</a> of European Jews to the land of Israel. This was named by Jabotinsky the "National Sport". The most significant part of this immigration prior to <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> was carried out by the <a href="/wiki/Revisionist_Zionism" title="Revisionist Zionism">Revisionist</a> camp, largely because the <a href="/wiki/Yishuv" title="Yishuv">Yishuv</a> institutions and the Jewish Agency shied away from such an expensive project, as well as the belief that Britain would in the future allow widespread Jewish immigration.</p>
<p>The Irgun joined forces with <a href="/wiki/Hatzohar" title="Hatzohar">Hatzohar</a> and <a href="/wiki/Betar" title="Betar">Beitar</a> in September 1937, when it assisted with the Aliyah of a convoy of 54 Beitar members at Tantura Beach (near <a href="/wiki/Haifa" title="Haifa">Haifa</a>). The Irgun was responsible for discreetly bringing the <a href="/wiki/Olim" title="Olim" class="mw-redirect">Olim</a>, or Jewish immigrants, to the beaches, and dispersing them among the various Jewish settlements. The Irgun also began participating in the organizing of the immigration enterprise and undertook the process of accompanying the ships. This began with the ship <i>Draga</i> which arrived at the coast of the land of Israel in September 1938. In August of the same year, an agreement was made between Ari Jabotinsky (the son of Ze'ev Jabotinsky), the Beitar representative and <a href="/wiki/Hillel_Kook" title="Hillel Kook">Hillel Kook</a>, the Irgun representative, to coordinate the immigration (also known as <a href="/wiki/Haapala" title="Haapala" class="mw-redirect">Haapala</a>). This agreement was also made in the "Paris Convention" in February 1939, at which also present were Ze'ev Jabotinsky and David Raziel. Afterwards, the "Aliyah Center" was founded, made up of representatives of Hatzohar, Beitar, and the Irgun, thereby making the Irgun a full participant in the organization and execution process.</p>
<p>The difficult conditions on the ships demanded a high level of discipline. The people on board the ships were often split into units, led by commanders. In addition to having a daily roll call and the distribution of food and water (usually very little of either), organized talks were held to provide information regarding the actual arrival in Palestine. One of the largest ships was the <i>Sakaria</i>, with 2,300 <a href="/wiki/Olim" title="Olim" class="mw-redirect">Olim</a>, who at the time made up 0.5% of the Jewish population in Palestine. The first vessel arrived on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1937-04-13"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="04-13"><a href="/wiki/April_13" title="April 13">April 13</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1937" title="1937">1937</a></span>, and the last on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1940-02-13"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="02-13"><a href="/wiki/February_13" title="February 13">February 13</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1940" title="1940">1940</a></span>.

<p>Irgun members continued to defend settlements, but at the same time began counter-attacks, thus ending the policy of restraint. These attacks were intended to instill fear in the Arab side, in order to cause the Arabs to wish for peace and quiet. In March 1938, David Raziel wrote in the underground newspaper "By the Sword" a constitutive article for the Irgun overall, in which he coined the term <b>"Active Defense"</b>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The actions of the Haganah alone will never be a true victory. If the goal of the war is to break the will of the enemy - and this cannot be attained without destroying his spirit - clearly we cannot be satisfied with solely defensive operations... Such a method of defense, that allows the enemy to attack at will, to reorganize and attack again... and does not intend to remove the enemy's ability to attack a second time - is called passive defense, and ends in downfall and destruction... whoever does not wish to be beaten has no choice but to attack. The fighting side, that does not intend to oppress but to save its liberty and honor, he too has only one way available - the way of attack.

<p>The first operations began around April 1936, and by the end of World War II, more than 250 Arabs had been killed. The trend of activities was an attempt to respond "<a href="/wiki/An_eye_for_an_eye" title="An eye for an eye" class="mw-redirect">an eye for an eye</a>" in the form of violent operations against Arab violence, and often to match the form of retaliation or its location to correspond to the attack that provoked it. A number of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>After an Arab shooting at Carmel school in Tel Aviv, which resulted in the death of a Jewish child, Irgun members attacked an Arab neighborhood near <a href="/wiki/Kerem_Hatemanim" title="Kerem Hatemanim" class="mw-redirect">Kerem Hatemanim</a> in Tel Aviv, killing one Arab man and injuring another.</li>
<li>On August 17, the Irgun responded to shootings by Arabs from the <a href="/wiki/Jaffa" title="Jaffa">Jaffa</a>-<a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> train towards Jews that were waiting by the train block on Herzl Street in Tel Aviv. The same day, when a Jewish child was injured by the shooting, Irgun members attacked a train on the same route, killing one Arab and injuring five.</li>
</ul>
<p>During 1936, Irgun members carried out approximately ten retaliatory operations.</p>
<p>Throughout 1937 the Irgun continued this line of operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>On March 6, a Jew at Sabbath prayers at the <a href="/wiki/Western_Wall" title="Western Wall">Western Wall</a> was shot by a local Arab. A few hours later, the Irgun shot at an Arab in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Rechavia.</li>
<li>On June 29, a band of Arabs attacked an <a href="/wiki/Egged_Bus_Cooperative" title="Egged Bus Cooperative">Egged</a> bus on the Jerusalem - Tel Aviv road, killing one Jew. The following day, two Jews were also killed near <a href="/wiki/Pardes_Hanna-Karkur" title="Pardes Hanna-Karkur">Karkur</a>. A few hours later, the Irgun carried out a number of operations.
<ul>
<li>An Arab bus making its way from <a href="/wiki/Lifta" title="Lifta">Lifta</a> was attacked in Jerusalem.</li>
<li>In two other locations in Jerusalem, Arabs were shot as well.</li>
<li>In Tel Aviv, a hand grenade was thrown at an Arab coffee shop on Carmel St., injuring many of the patrons.</li>
<li>Irgun members also injured an Arab on Reines St. in Tel Aviv.</li>
<li>On September 5, the Irgun responded to the murder of a rabbi on his way home from prayer in the <a href="/wiki/Old_City_of_Jerusalem" title="Old City of Jerusalem" class="mw-redirect">Old City of Jerusalem</a> by throwing explosives at an Arab bus that had left Lifta, injuring two female passengers and a British police officer.</li>
</ul>

<p>At that time, however, these acts were not yet a part of a formulated policy of the Irgun.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Not all of the aforementioned operations received a commander's approval, and Jabotinsky was not in favor of such actions at the time. Jabotinsky still hoped to establish a Jewish force out in the open that would not have to operate underground. However, the failure, in its eyes, of the <a href="/wiki/Peel_Commission" title="Peel Commission">Peel Commission</a> and the renewal of violence on the part of the Arabs caused the Irgun to rethink its official policy.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Irgun&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Increase in operations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Increase in operations</span></h3>
<p>14 November, 1937 was a watershed in Irgun activity. From that date, the Irgun increased its reprisals. Following an increase in the number of attacks aimed at Jews, including the killing of five <a href="/wiki/Kibbutz" title="Kibbutz">kibbutz</a> members near <a href="/wiki/Kiryat_Anavim" title="Kiryat Anavim">Kiryat Anavim</a> (today kibbutz <a href="/wiki/Ma%27ale_HaHamisha" title="Ma'ale HaHamisha">Ma'ale HaHamisha</a>), the Irgun undertook a series of attacks in various places in Jerusalem, killing five Arabs. Operations were also undertaken in <a href="/wiki/Haifa" title="Haifa">Haifa</a> (shooting at the Arab-populated Wadi Nisnas neighborhood) and in <a href="/wiki/Herzliya" title="Herzliya">Herzliya</a>. The date is known as the day the policy of restraint (<a href="/wiki/Havlagah" title="Havlagah">Havlagah</a>) ended, or as "Black Sunday". This is when the organization fully changed its policy, with the approval of Jabotinsky and Headquarters to the policy of "active defense" in respect of Irgun actions.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The British responded with the arrest of Beitar and Hatzohar members as suspected members of the Irgun. Military courts were allowed to act under "Time of Emergency Regulations" and even sentence people to death. In this manner Yehezkel Altman, a guard in a Beitar battalion in the Nahalat Yizchak neighborhood of Tel Aviv, shot at an Arab bus, without his commanders' knowledge. Altman was acting in response to a shooting at Jewish vehicles on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem road the day before. He turned himself in later and was sentenced to death, a sentence which was later commuted to a life sentence.</p>
<p>Despite the arrests, Irgun members continued fighting. Jabotinsky lent his moral support to these activities. In a letter to Moshe Rosenberg on 18 March 1938 he wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Tell them: from afar I collect and save, as precious treasures, news items about your lives. I know of the obstacles that have not impeded your spirit; and I know of your actions as well. I am overjoyed that I have been blessed with such students.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Irgun continued activities such as these, however following Rosenberg's orders they were greatly curtailed. Furthermore, in fear of the British threat of the death sentence for anyone found carrying a weapon, all operations were suspended for eight months. However, opposition to this policy gradually increased. In April, 1938, responding to the killing of six Jews, in which a woman was raped and dismembered, Beitar members from the <a href="/wiki/Rosh_Pinna" title="Rosh Pinna">Rosh Pina</a> Brigade went on a reprisal mission, without the consent of their commander, as described by historian <a href="/wiki/Avi_Shlaim" title="Avi Shlaim">Avi Shlaim</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>On 21 April 1938, after several weeks of planning, he and two of his colleagues from the Irgun (Etzel) ambushed an Arab bus at a bend on a mountain road near Safad. They had a hand-grenade, a gun and a pistol. Their plan was to destroy the engine so that the bus would fall off the side of the road and all the passengers would be killed. When the bus approached, they fired at it (not in the air, as Mailer has it) but the grenade lobbed by Ben Yosef did not detonate. The bus with its screaming and terrified passengers drove on.</i><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Although the incident ended without casualties, the three were caught, and one of them - <a href="/wiki/Shlomo_Ben-Yosef" title="Shlomo Ben-Yosef">Shlomo Ben-Yosef</a> was sentenced to death. Demonstrations around the country, as well as pressure from institutions and people such as <a href="/wiki/Haim_Weizman" title="Haim Weizman" class="mw-redirect">Dr. Chaim Weizmann</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Rabbi" title="Chief Rabbi">Chief Rabbi</a> of <a href="/wiki/British_Mandate_of_Palestine" title="British Mandate of Palestine">Mandatory Palestine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yitzhak_HaLevi_Herzog" title="Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog">Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog</a> did not reduce his sentence. In Shlomo Ben-Yosef's writings in Hebrew were later found:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I am going to die and I am not sorry at all. Why? Because I am going to die for our country. Shlomo Ben-Yosef.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>On 29 June 1938 he was executed, and was the first of <a href="/wiki/Olei_Hagardom" title="Olei Hagardom">Olei Hagardom</a>. The Irgun revered him after his death and many regarded him as an example.</p>
<p>In light of this, and due to the anger of the Irgun leadership over the decision to adopt a policy of restraint until that point, Jabotinsky relieved Rosenberg of his post and replaced him with David Raziel, who proved to be the most prominent Irgun commander until <a href="/wiki/Menachem_Begin" title="Menachem Begin">Menachem Begin</a>. Jabotinsky simultaneously instructed the Irgun to end its policy of restraint, leading to armed offensive operations until the end of the Arab Revolt in 1939. In this time, the Irgun mounted about 40 operations against Arabs and Arab villages, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>After a Jewish father and son were killed in the Old City of Jerusalem, on June 6, 1938, Irgun members threw explosives from the roof of a nearby house, killing two Arabs and injuring four.</li>
<li>The Irgun planted <a href="/wiki/Land_mine" title="Land mine">land mines</a> in a number of Arab <a href="/wiki/Souk" title="Souk" class="mw-redirect">markets</a>, primarily in places identified by the Irgun as activity centers of armed Arab gangs.
<ul>
<li>Explosives detonated in the Arab <a href="/wiki/Souk" title="Souk" class="mw-redirect">souk</a> in Jerusalem on July 15, killed ten local Arabs.</li>
<li>In similar circumstances, 70 Arabs were killed by a land mine planted in the Arab souk in Haifa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This action led the <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">British Parliament</a> to discuss the disturbances in Palestine. On 23 February 1939 the <a href="/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_the_Colonies" title="Secretary of State for the Colonies">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_MacDonald" title="Malcolm MacDonald">Malcolm MacDonald</a> revealed the British intention to cancel the mandate and establish a state that would preserve Arab rights. This caused a wave of riots and attacks by Arabs against Jews. The Irgun responded four days later with a series of attacks on Arab buses and other sites. The British used military force against the Arab rioters and in the latter stages of the revolt by the Arab community in Palestine deteriorated into a series of internal gang wars.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Irgun&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: During the same period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">During the same period</span></h4>
<p>In reality, the armed operations against Arabs were the actions of small groups, or even individual Irgun members. Most of the Irgun were involved during this time with protection and defense of settlements. By the late thirties, the Irgun comprised mainly Beitar youth (from its branches or from its work brigades), Hazohar members and the National Workers Union, youth belonging to the <a href="/wiki/Maccabi_World_Union" title="Maccabi World Union">Maccabi</a> youth group, members of the religious youth group "Alliance of the Hasmoneans" and students from the national unions <i>Yavneh</i>, <i>Yodfat</i> and <i>Elal</i>. In certain places, including settlements in <a href="/wiki/Samaria" title="Samaria">Samaria</a> (now known as the northern <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>), the <a href="/wiki/Sharon_plain" title="Sharon plain">Sharon</a> and southern <a href="/wiki/Judea" title="Judea">Judea</a>, these were the primary defensive forces. In some areas Irgun forces cooperated with Haganah members, such as in the setting up of Tel Tzur (now known as <a href="/wiki/Even_Yehuda" title="Even Yehuda">Even Yehuda</a>), a <a href="/wiki/Tower_and_stockade" title="Tower and stockade">tower and stockade</a> Beitar settlement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Irgun also established itself in Europe. The Irgun built underground cells that participated in organizing Aliyah convoys. The cells were made up almost entirely of Beitar members, and their primary activity was military training in preparation for emigration to Palestine. Ties formed with the Polish authorities brought about courses in which Irgun commanders were trained by Polish officers in advanced military issues such as <a href="/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare" title="Guerrilla warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tactic_(method)" title="Tactic (method)">tactics</a> and laying land mines. <a href="/wiki/Avraham_Stern" title="Avraham Stern">Avraham (Yair) Stern</a> was notable among the cell organizers in Europe. In 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the underground. The transfer of handguns, rifles, explosives and ammunition stopped with the outbreak of World War II. Another field in which the Irgun operated was the training of pilots, so they could serve in the <a href="/wiki/Air_Force" title="Air Force" class="mw-redirect">Air Force</a> in the future war for independence, in the flight school in <a href="/wiki/Lod" title="Lod">Lod</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 1938 there was progress towards aligning the ideologies of the Irgun and the Haganah. Many rid themselves of the illusion that the land would be divided and a Jewish state would soon exist. The Haganah founded פו"מ, a special operations unit, (pronounced <i>poom</i>), which carried out armed operations in response to, and in order to prevent Arab violence. These operations continued into 1939. Furthermore, the opposition within the <a href="/wiki/Yishuv" title="Yishuv">Yishuv</a> to illegal immigration significantly decreased, and the Haganah began to bring Jews to Palestine using rented ships, as the Irgun had in the past.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Irgun&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: First operations against the British">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First operations against the British</span></h3>
<p>The publishing of <a href="/wiki/MacDonald_White_Paper" title="MacDonald White Paper" class="mw-redirect">MacDonald White Paper</a> in May 1939 brought with it new edicts that were intended to lead to a more equitable settlement between Jews and Arabs. However, it was considered by some to have an adverse effect on the continued development of the Jewish community. Chief among these was the prohibition on selling land to Jews, and minuscule quotas for Jewish immigration. The entire Yishuv was furious at the contents of the White Paper. There were demonstrations against the "Treacherous Paper", the ultimate British betrayal of the Jews as it was thought to preclude the establishment of a homeland in the land of Israel.</p>
<p>The Irgun began sabotaging strategic infrastructure such as electricity facilities, radio and telephone lines. It also started publicizing its activity and its goals. This was done in street announcements, newspapers, as well as the underground radio station <a href="/wiki/Kol_TSion_HaLokhemet" title="Kol TSion HaLokhemet">Kol Zion HaLochemet</a>. The British responded with numerous arrests of Beitar and <a href="/wiki/Hatzohar" title="Hatzohar">Hatzohar</a> members, some of whom were mistreated to obtain information about the Irgun. The Irgun warned that such activity would lead to a response. On August 26, 1939 the Irgun published a death sentence against Ralph Krans, a British police officer who, as head of the Jewish Department in their secret police, had tortured a number of youths who were underground members. Krans and another British officer in the secret police were killed from a hidden mine explosion by the Irgun.</p>
<p>The British increased their efforts against the Irgun. As a result David Raziel, commander of the Irgun was arrested on May 19. On August 31 the British police arrested members meeting of the Irgun headquarters.

<p>Following the outbreak of war, Ze'ev Jabotinsky and the <a href="/wiki/New_Zionist_Organization" title="New Zionist Organization">New Zionist Organization</a> voiced their support for Britain and France. In mid-September 1939 Raziel was moved from his place of detention in <a href="/wiki/Tzrifin" title="Tzrifin">Tzrifin</a>. This, among other events, triggered the Irgun to announce a cessation of its activities against the British so as not to hinder Britain's effort to fight "the Hebrew's greatest enemy in the world - German <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>". This announcement ended with the hope that after the war a Hebrew state would be founded "within the historical borders of the liberated homeland". After this announcement Irgun, Beitar and Hatzohar members, including Raziel and the Irgun leadership, were gradually released from detention. The Irgun did not rule out joining the British Army and the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Brigade" title="Jewish Brigade">Jewish Brigade</a>. Irgun members did enlist in various army units.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Irgun members also assisted British forces with intelligence in <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>. An Irgun unit also operated in <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lebanon" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. David Raziel later died in such an operation in the service of Britain.</p>
<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Holocaust" title="Holocaust" class="mw-redirect">Holocaust</a> Beitar members revolted numerous times against the Nazis in occupied Europe. The largest of these revolts was the <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising" title="Warsaw Ghetto Uprising">Warsaw Ghetto Uprising</a> where an armed underground organization fought, comprising Beitar, Hatzohar and Polish Irgun cell members and known as <i><a href="/wiki/Jewish_Military_Union" title="Jewish Military Union">Żydowski Związek Wojskowy</a></i> (Jewish Military Union). There were instances of Beitar members enlisted in the British military smuggling British weapons to the Irgun.</p>
<p>From 1939 onwards, an Irgun delegation in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> worked for the creation of a Jewish army made up of Jewish refugees and Jews from Palestine, to fight alongside the Allied Forces. In July 1943 the "Emergency Committee to Save the Jewish People in Europe" was formed, and worked until the end of the war to rescue the Jews of Europe from the Nazis and to garner public support. However, it was not until January 1944 that President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D.

Avraham (Yair) Stern</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Throughout this entire period the British continued enforcing the <a href="/wiki/MacDonald_White_Paper" title="MacDonald White Paper" class="mw-redirect">MacDonald White Paper</a>'s provisions, which included a ban on the sale of land to Jews, restrictions on Jewish immigration and increased vigilance against illegal immigration. Part of the reason why the British banned land sales (to anyone) was the confused state of the post Ottoman land registery; it was difficult to determine who actually owned the land that was for sale.</p>
<p>Within the ranks of the Irgun this created much disappointment and unrest, at the center of which was disagreement with the leadership of the <a href="/wiki/New_Zionist_Organization" title="New Zionist Organization">New Zionist Organization</a>, David Raziel and the Irgun Headquarters. On June 18, 1939 Avraham (Yair) Stern and others of the leadership were released from prison and a rift opened between them the Irgun and Hatzohar leadership. The controversy centred on the issues of the underground movement submitting to public political leadership and those of fighting the British. On his release from prison Raziel resigned from Headquarters. To his chagrin, independent operations of senior members of the Irgun were carried out and even some commanders who doubted Raziel's loyalty.</p>
<p>In this stead, Stern was elected to the leadership. Beitar and Hatzohar members resented this appointment because it was seen as undermining Jabotinsky's authority. In the past, Stern had founded secret Irgun cells in Poland without Jabotinsky's knowledge, in opposition to his opinion. Furthermore, Stern was in favor of removing the Irgun from the authority of New Zionist Organization, whose leadership urged Raziel to return to the command of the Irgun, and he finally consented. Jabotinsky wrote to Raziel and to Stern. These letters were distributed to the branches of the Irgun:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>'...I call upon you: Let nothing disturb our unity. Listen to the commissioner (Raziel), whom I trust, and promise me that you and <a href="/wiki/Betar" title="Betar">Beitar</a>, the greatest of my life's achievements, will stand strong and united and allow me to continue with the hope for victory in the war to realize our old <a href="/wiki/Maccabees" title="Maccabees">Maccabean</a> dream...'</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Stern was sent a telegram with an order to obey Raziel, who was reappointed. However, these events did not prevent the splitting of the organization. Suspicion and distrust were rampant among the members. Out of the Irgun a new organization was created on July 17, 1940,<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> which was first named "The National Military Organization in Israel" (as opposed to the "National Military Organization in <b>the Land of</b> Israel") and later on changed its name to <a href="/wiki/Lehi_(group)" title="Lehi (group)">Lehi</a>, an acronym for <b>Lohamei Herut Israel</b>, "Fighters for the Freedom of Israel", (לח"י - לוחמי חירות ישראל). Jabotinsky died in <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, on August 4, 1940, yet this did not prevent the Lehi split.</p>
<p>The primary difference between the Irgun and the newly formed organization was its intention to fight the British in Palestine, regardless of their war against Germany. Later, additional operational and ideological differences developed that contradicted some of the Irgun's guiding principles. For example the Lehi supported the exchange of population with regards to the local Arabs. The Irgun, on the other hand, acted according the Revisionist school of thought that said 'There he shall quench his thirst with plenty and happiness, the son of Arab, son of Nazareth (i.e. Christian) and my son.'</p>
<p>Moreover, the Irgun's fight against the British was only intended to expel them from the area, and the option of future diplomatic ties with Britain was not discounted. The Lehi, however, declared total war against imperialism and the empire. Also unlike Irgun fighters, Lehi fighters would travel with their weapon on them at all times. One more striking difference was the fact that the Irgun concentrated its operations against British centers of government and its facilities in Palestine, and sometimes warned the British about impending explosions. This contrasted the Lehi's struggle that, at times, was directed towards personal attacks and the assassination of leadership, military, and police figures.</p>

<p>The split damaged the Irgun both organizationally and from a morale point of view. As their spiritual leader, Jabotinsky's death also added to this feeling. Together, these factor brought about a mass abandonment by members. The British secret police took advantage of this weakness to gather intelligence and arrest Irgun activists. The new Irgun leadership, which included Meridor, Yerachmiel Ha'Levi, Moshe Segal and others used the forced hiatus in activity to rebuild the injured organization. This period was also marked by more cooperation between the Irgun and the Jewish Agency, however <a href="/wiki/David_Ben_Gurion" title="David Ben Gurion" class="mw-redirect">Ben Gurion's</a> uncompromising demand that Irgun accept the Agency's command foiled any further cooperation.</p>
<p>In both the Irgun and the Haganah more voices were being heard opposing any cooperation with the British. Nevertheless, an Irgun operation carried out in the service of Britain was aimed at sabotaging pro-Nazi forces in <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, including the assassination of <a href="/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husayni" title="Haj Amin al-Husayni" class="mw-redirect">Haj Amin al-Husayni</a>. Among others, Raziel and <a href="/wiki/Yaakov_Meridor" title="Yaakov Meridor">Yaakov Meridor</a> participated. On April 20, 1941, during a Luftwaffe air raid on Habbaniya Airport near <a href="/wiki/Baghdad" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, David Raziel, commander of the Irgun, was killed during the operation.</p>
<p>In late 1943 a joint Haganah - Irgun initiative was developed, to form a single fighting body, unaligned with any political party, by the name of עם לוחם (<i>Fighting Nation</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> The new body's first plan was to kidnap the British High Commissioner of Palestine, <a href="/wiki/Harold_MacMichael" title="Harold MacMichael">Sir Harold MacMichael</a> and deport him to <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. However the Haganah leaked the planned operation and it was thwarted before it got off the ground. Nevertheless, at this stage the Irgun ceased its cooperation with the British. As <a href="/wiki/Eliyahu_Lankin" title="Eliyahu Lankin">Eliyahu Lankin</a> tells in his book:</p>

<p>In 1943 the <a href="/wiki/II_Corps_(Poland)" title="II Corps (Poland)">Polish II Corps</a>, commanded by <a href="/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Anders" title="Władysław Anders">Władysław Anders</a>, arrived in Palestine from <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. The British insisted that no Jewish units of the army be created. Eventually, many of the soldiers of Jewish origin that arrived with the army were released and allowed to stay in Palestine. One of them was <a href="/wiki/Menachem_Begin" title="Menachem Begin">Menachem Begin</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> whose arrival in Palestine created new-found expectations within the Irgun and Beitar. Begin had served as head of the Beitar movement in <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> and was a respected leader. <a href="/wiki/Yaakov_Meridor" title="Yaakov Meridor">Yaakov Meridor</a>, then the commander of the Irgun, raised the idea of appointing Begin to the post. In late 1943, when Begin accepted the position, a new leadership was formed. Meridor became Begin's deputy, and other members of the board were Aryeh Ben Eliezer, Eliyahu Lankin, and Shlomo Lev Ami.<sup id="cite_ref-etzel06_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-etzel06-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On February 1, 1944 the Irgun put up posters all around the country, proclaiming a revolt against the British mandatory government. The posters began by saying that all of the <a href="/wiki/Zionism" title="Zionism">Zionist</a> movements stood by the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied Forces</a> and over 25,000 Jews had enlisted in the British military. The hope to establish a Jewish army had died. Throughout the war the Middle East Arabs had favoured Germany's side. European Jewry was trapped and was being destroyed, yet Britain, for its part, did not allow any rescue missions. This part of the document ends with the following words:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><a href="/wiki/MacDonald_White_Paper" title="MacDonald White Paper" class="mw-redirect">The White Paper</a> is still in effect. It is enforced, despite the betrayal of the Arabs and the loyalty of the Jews; despite the mass enlisting to the British Army; despite the <a href="/wiki/Ceasefire" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a> and the quiet in The Land of Israel; despite the massacre of masses of the Jewish people in Europe...</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The facts are simple and horrible as one. Over the last four years of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">the war</a> we have lost millions of the best of our people; millions more are in danger of eradication. And The Land of Israel is closed off and quarantined because the British rule it, realizing the White Paper, and strives for the destruction of our people's last hope.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Irgun then declared that, for its part, the ceasefire was over and they were now at war with the British. It demanded the transfer of rule to a Jewish government, to implement ten policies. Among these were the mass evacuation of Jews from Europe, the signing of treaties with any state that recognized the Jewish state's sovereignty, including Britain, granting social justice to the state's residents, and full equality to the Arab population. The proclamation ended with:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The God of Israel, God of Hosts, will be at our side. There is no retreat. Liberty or death. ...the fighting youth will not recoil in the face of sacrifices and suffering, blood and torment. They will not surrender, so long as our days of old are not renewed, so long as our nation is not ensured a homeland, liberty, honor, bread, justice and law.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The Irgun began this campaign rather weakly — the organization was only about 1,000 strong, out of which only some 200 were fighters. Weapons were also sparse. The Irgun underwent a reorganization and was redivided in different brigades: Combat Corps - the Irgun's primary fighting force; The Sea - the Irgun's special operations unit; Delek (דלק - Gasoline) - intelligence; HATAM ( חת"מ - Revolutionary Publicity Corps); and HAT (ח"ת - Planning Division). The Irgun became more secretive and its commanders assumed new identities and homes. Begin, for example, assumed a Rabbi's identity ("Yisrael Sasover"), and was sometimes known as "Ben Ze'ev" or "Dr. Kenigshopper".</p>

<p>The Irgun began a militant operation against the symbols of government, in an attempt to harm the regime's operation as well as its reputation. The Irgun made a rule for itself - no individual terror and an attempt to avoid casualties;<sup id="cite_ref-etzel06_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-etzel06-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> it is a matter of debate as to whether Irgun met these rules. The first attack was on February 12, 1944 at the government immigration offices, a symbol of the immigration laws. The attacks went smoothly and ended with no casualties—as they took place on a Saturday night, when the buildings were empty—in the three largest cities: Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. On February 27 the income tax offices were bombed. Parts of the same cities were blown up, also on a Saturday night; prior warnings were put up near the buildings. On March 23 the national headquarters building of the British police in the <a href="/wiki/Migrash_Harusim" title="Migrash Harusim" class="mw-redirect">Russian Compound</a> in Jerusalem was attacked, and part of it was blown up. These attacks in the first few months were sharply condemned by the organized leadership of the Yishuv and by the Jewish Agency, who saw them as dangerous provocations.</p>
<p>At the same time the <a href="/wiki/Lehi_(group)" title="Lehi (group)">Lehi</a> also renewed its attacks against the British.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> The Irgun continued to attack police stations and headquarters, and <a href="/wiki/Tegart_fort" title="Tegart fort">Tegart Fort</a>, a fortified police station (today the location of <a href="/wiki/Latrun" title="Latrun">Latrun</a>). One relatively complex operation was overtaking of the governmental radio station in <a href="/wiki/Ramallah" title="Ramallah">Ramallah</a>, on May 17, 1944.</p>
<p>One symbolic act by the Irgun happened before <a href="/wiki/Yom_Kippur" title="Yom Kippur">Yom Kippur</a> of 1944. They plastered notices around town, warning that no British officers should come to the <a href="/wiki/Western_Wall" title="Western Wall">Western Wall</a> on Yom Kippur, and for the first time since the mandate began no British police officers were there to prevent the Jews from the traditional <a href="/wiki/Shofar" title="Shofar">Shofar</a> blowing at the end of the fast.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> After the fast that year the Irgun attacked four police stations in Arab settlements. In order to obtain weapons, the Irgun carried out "confiscation" operations - they took over British armouries and smuggled stolen weapons to their own hiding places. During this phase of activity the Irgun also cut all of its official ties with the <a href="/wiki/New_Zionist_Organization" title="New Zionist Organization">New Zionist Organization</a>, so as not to tie their fate in the underground organization.</p>

<p>In October 1944 the British began expelling hundreds of arrested Irgun and Lehi members to detention camps in Africa. 251 detainees from <a href="/wiki/Latrun" title="Latrun">Latrun</a> were flown on thirteen planes, on October 19 to a camp in <a href="/wiki/Asmara" title="Asmara">Asmara</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eritrea" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>. Eleven additional transports were made. Throughout the period of their detention, the detainees often initiated rebellions and hunger strikes. Many escape attempts were made until July 1948 when the exiles were returned to Israel. While there were numerous successful escapes from the camp itself, only nine men actually made it back all the way. One noted success was that of <a href="/wiki/Yaakov_Meridor" title="Yaakov Meridor">Yaakov Meridor</a>, who escaped nine times before finally reaching Europe in April 1948.

<p>On November 6, 1944, <a href="/wiki/Walter_Guinness,_1st_Baron_Moyne" title="Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne">Lord Moyne</a>, British Deputy Resident Minister of State in <a href="/wiki/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> was assassinated by Lehi members <a href="/wiki/Eliyahu_Hakim" title="Eliyahu Hakim">Eliyahu Hakim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eliyahu_Bet-Zuri" title="Eliyahu Bet-Zuri">Eliyahu Bet-Zuri</a>. This act raised concerns within the Yishuv from the British regime's reaction to the underground's violent acts against them. Therefore the Jewish Agency decided on starting a <i>Hunting Season</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> known as the <i>saison</i>, (from the <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> "la saison de chasse"). During the Hunting Season people suspected of belonging to or supporting the Irgun or the Lehi were removed from schools, work places and the <i>Klalit</i> <a href="/wiki/Health_maintenance_organization" title="Health maintenance organization">HMO</a>. Most of the people who partook in these activities were members of the Haganah and the <a href="/wiki/Palmach" title="Palmach">Palmach</a>. They carried out surveillance, kidnapping, investigation of Irgun and Lehi members and either turned them over to the British, or provided details regarding their whereabouts. Among those turned over were members of the Irgun headquarters - Yaakov Meridor, Shlomo Lev Ami, and Eliyahu Lankin.</p>
<p>The Hunting Season managed to paralyze the Irgun's activity for a few months, but not destroy the organization. The Irgun's recuperation was noticeable when it began to renew its cooperation with the Lehi in May 1945, when it sabotaged oil pipelines, telephone lines and railroad bridges. All in all, over 1,000 members of the Irgun and Lehi were arrested and interred in British camps during the <i>Saison</i>. Eventually the Hunting Season died out, and there was even talk of cooperation with the Haganah leading to the formation of <a href="/wiki/The_Jewish_Resistance_Movement" title="The Jewish Resistance Movement" class="mw-redirect">The Jewish Resistance Movement</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of July 1945 the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> party in Britain was elected to power. The Yishuv leadership had high hopes that this would change the anti-Zionist policy that the British maintained at the time. However, these hopes were quickly dashed when the government limited <a href="/wiki/Aliyah" title="Aliyah">Aliyah</a> with the intention that the population of Palestine west of the <a href="/wiki/Jordan_River" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a> would not be more than one third of the total. This, along with the stepping up of arrests and their pursuit of underground members and illegal immigration organizers led to the formation of the <a href="/wiki/The_Jewish_Resistance_Movement" title="The Jewish Resistance Movement" class="mw-redirect">Jewish Resistance Movement</a>. This body consolidated the armed resistance to the British of the Irgun, Lehi, and the Haganah. For ten months the Irgun and the Lehi cooperated and they carried out nineteen attacks and defense operations. The Haganah and the Palmach carried out ten such operations. Furthermore, the Haganah assisted in landing 13,000 illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Tension between the underground movements and the British increased with the increase in operations. On April 23, 1945 an operation undertaken by the Irgun in <a href="/wiki/Tegart_fort" title="Tegart fort">Tegart Fort</a> went badly and gunfights broke out. One Irgun member was killed and his body was later hanged on the fort's fence. Another fighter, Yizchak Bilu, was killed as well in a diversionary ploy - an explosive device fell out of his hand, and he leapt onto it in order to save his comrades, who were also carrying explosives. A third fighter, <a href="/wiki/Dov_Gruner" title="Dov Gruner">Dov Gruner</a>, was caught. He stood trial and was sentenced to be death by hanging, refusing to sign a pardon request.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1946, British relations with the Yishuv worsened, building up to <a href="/wiki/Operation_Agatha" title="Operation Agatha">Operation Agatha</a> of June 29. The government denied the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-American_Committee_of_Inquiry" title="Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry">Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry</a>'s recommendation to bring 100,000 Jews to Palestine at once. As a result of the discovery of documents tying the Jewish Agency to The Jewish Resistance Movement, the Irgun was asked to speed up the plans for the <a href="/wiki/King_David_Hotel_bombing" title="King David Hotel bombing">King David Hotel bombing</a> of July 22.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> The hotel was where the documents were located, the base for the British Secretariat, the military command and a branch of the Criminal Investigation Division (police). The Irgun later said that a warning sent out ahead of time was never taken seriously.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The King David Hotel bombing and the arrest of Jewish Agency and other Yishuv leaders as part of <a href="/wiki/Operation_Agatha" title="Operation Agatha">Operation Agatha</a> caused the Haganah to cease their armed resistance activity against the British. Yishuv and Jewish Agency leaders were released from prison at <a href="/wiki/Tegart_fort" title="Tegart fort">Tegart Fort</a>. From then until the end of the British mandate the resistance was led by the Irgun and Lehi. In early September 1946 the Irgun renewed its attacks, against railroads, communication lines and bridges. One prominent operation was the attack on the train station in Jerusalem, in which <a href="/wiki/Meir_Feinstein" title="Meir Feinstein">Meir Feinstein</a> was arrested and later committed suicide awaiting execution. According to the Irgun these sort of operations were legitimate, since the trains primarily served the British, for redeployment of their forces. For a while the British stopped train traffic at night. The Irgun also publicized warnings, in three languages, not to use specific trains in danger of being attacked. The Irgun also re-established many representative offices internationally, and by 1948 operated in 23 states. In these countries the Irgun sometimes acted against the local British representatives or led public relations campaigns against Britain. On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1946-10-31"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="10-31"><a href="/wiki/October_31" title="October 31">October 31</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1946" title="1946">1946</a></span>, in response to the British barring entry of Jews from Palestine, the Irgun blew up the British embassy in <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In December 1946 a sentence of 18 years and 18 beatings was handed down to a young Irgun member. The Irgun made good on a threat they made and after the detainee was beaten, Irgun members kidnapped British officers and beat them in public. The operation, known as the "<a href="/wiki/Night_of_the_Beatings" title="Night of the Beatings">Night of the Beatings</a>" brought an end to British beatings punishments. The British, taking these acts seriously, moved many British families in Palestine into the confines of military bases, and some moved home.</p>

The Yishuv thought of the idea to transfer the issue to the UN as a British attempt to save time until a UN inquiry commission would be established, and its ideas discussed, all the while the Yishuv would weaken. <a href="/wiki/Mossad_Le%27aliyah_Bet" title="Mossad Le'aliyah Bet">Foundation for Immigration B</a> increased the number of ships which, in fact, saved the lives of European Jews. The British still strictly enforced the policy of immigration and illegal immigrants were placed in detention camps in <a href="/wiki/Cyprus" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, which only increased the anger of the Jewish community towards the mandate government.</p>
<p>The Irgun stepped up its activity and from <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="02-19"><a href="/wiki/February_19" title="February 19">February 19</a></span> until <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="03-03"><a href="/wiki/March_3" title="March 3">March 3</a></span> it attacked 18 British military camps, convoy routes, vehicles, and other facilities.

<p>This episode, along with the King David Hotel bombing, and the beating of the British officers is thought to be one of the deciding factors in the British final choice to leave Palestine. The <a href="/wiki/United_Nations_Special_Committee_on_Palestine" title="United Nations Special Committee on Palestine">United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)</a> was also influenced by these actions.

During the UN's deliberations regarding the committee's recommendations the Irgun avoided initiating any attacks, so as not to influence the UN negatively on the idea of a Jewish state. On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="11-29"><a href="/wiki/November_29" title="November 29">November 29</a></span> the <a href="/wiki/UN_General_Assembly" title="UN General Assembly" class="mw-redirect">UN General Assembly</a> voted in favor of ending the mandate and <a href="/wiki/1947_UN_Partition_Plan" title="1947 UN Partition Plan" class="mw-redirect">establishing two states</a> on the land. That very same day the Irgun and the Lehi renewed their attacks on British targets. Then next day the local Arabs began attacking the Jewish community, thus beginning the first stage of the <a href="/wiki/Israeli_War_of_Independence" title="Israeli War of Independence" class="mw-redirect">Israeli War of Independence</a>. The first attacks on Jews were in Jewish neighborhoods of <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, in and around <a href="/wiki/Jaffa" title="Jaffa">Jaffa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bat_Yam" title="Bat Yam">Bat Yam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Holon" title="Holon">Holon</a>, and Ha'Tikvah neighborhood in <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1947 the Irgun membership was approximately 4,000 people. The goal of the organization at that point was the conquest of the land between the Jordan River and the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> for the sake of the future Jewish state and preventing the <a href="/wiki/Arab_Legion" title="Arab Legion">Arab Legion</a> from destroying the Jewish community. The Irgun became almost an overt organization, establishing military bases in <a href="/wiki/Ramat_Gan" title="Ramat Gan">Ramat Gan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Petah_Tikva" title="Petah Tikva">Petah Tikva</a>. Additionally it recruited openly, thus significantly increasing in size. During the war the Irgun fought alongside the Lehi and the Haganah in the front against the Arab attacks. At first the Haganah maintained a defensive policy, as it had until then, but after the <a href="/wiki/Convoy_of_35" title="Convoy of 35">Convoy of 35</a> incident it completely abandoned its policy of restraint: "Distinguishing between individuals is longer possible, for now - it is a war, and the even the innocent shall not be absolved."<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Irgun also began carrying out reprisal missions, as it had under David Raziel's command. At the same time though, it published announcements calling on the Arabs to lay down their weapons and maintain a ceasefire:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The National Military Organization has warned you, if the murderous attacks on Jewish civilians shall continue, its soldiers will penetrate your centers of activity and plague you. You have not heeded the warning. You continued to harm our brothers and murder them in wild cruelty. Therefore soldiers of the National Military Organization will go on the attack, as we have warned you.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>...However even in these frenzied time, when Arab and Jewish blood is spilled at the British enslaver, we hereby call upon you... to stop the attacks and create peace between us.

<p>However the mutual attacks continued. The Irgun attacked the Arab villages of <a href="/wiki/Al-Tira_(Haifa)" title="Al-Tira (Haifa)" class="mw-redirect">Tira</a> near <a href="/wiki/Haifa" title="Haifa">Haifa</a>, Yehudiya ('Abassiya) in the center, and <a href="/wiki/Shuafat" title="Shuafat">Shuafat</a> by Jerusalem. The Irgun also attacked in the Wadi Rushmiya neighborhood in Haifa and Abu Kabir in <a href="/wiki/Jaffa" title="Jaffa">Jaffa</a>. On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="12-29"><a href="/wiki/December_29" title="December 29">December 29</a></span> Irgun units arrived by boat to the Jaffa shore and a gunfight between them and Arab gangs ensued. The <a href="/wiki/December_30" title="December 30">following day</a> seven Arabs were killed, and dozens injured, near the refineries in Haifa. In response, Arab workers <a href="/wiki/Haifa_Oil_Refinery_massacre" title="Haifa Oil Refinery massacre">attacked Jews in the area</a>, killing 41. This sparked a Haganah response in <a href="/wiki/Balad_al-Shaykh_raid" title="Balad al-Shaykh raid" class="mw-redirect">Balad al-Sheykh</a>. The Irgun's goal in the fighting was to move the battles from Jewish populated areas to Arab populated areas.

On 5 January 1948 the Irgun detonated a lorry bomb outside Jaffa's Ottoman built Town Hall, killing 14 and injuring 19.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> In Jerusalem, two days later, Irgun members in a stolen police van rolled a barrel bomb<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> into a large group of civilians who were waiting for a bus by the <a href="/wiki/Jaffa_Gate" title="Jaffa Gate">Jaffa Gate</a>, killing around sixteen.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> In the pursuit that followed three of the attackers were killed and two taken prisoner.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In February the Irgun attacked traffic near Yehudiya ('Abassiya), Yazur, and <a href="/wiki/Ramle" title="Ramle" class="mw-redirect">Ramle</a>. Irgun fighters participated in fights against Arab militants in Ramle and <a href="/wiki/Qalqilyah" title="Qalqilyah">Qalqilyah</a>. On 29 February the Irgun blew up the Cairo to Haifa train shortly after it left <a href="/wiki/Rehovot_Railway_Station" title="Rehovot Railway Station">Rehovot Railway Station</a> killing 29 British soldiers. The Irgun announcement said the bombing was in retaliation for the bombing of <a href="/wiki/Ben_Yehuda_Street" title="Ben Yehuda Street">Ben Yehuda Street</a>, Jerusalem, a week earlier.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> An identical attack, on 31 March, killed forty people and injured 60 'when the Haifa-Cairo express train was blown up by electrically-detonated mines near the Jewish colony of Benyamina'.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> In March the Irgun attacked the village of Qaqun (near <a href="/wiki/Tulkarem" title="Tulkarem" class="mw-redirect">Tulkarem</a>), which had many Arab militants among its residents. On 6 April 1948, the Irgun raided the British Army camp at <a href="/wiki/Pardes_Hanna" title="Pardes Hanna" class="mw-redirect">Pardes Hanna</a> killing six British soldiers and their commanding officer.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre" title="Deir Yassin massacre">Deir Yassin massacre</a> was carried out in a village west of Jerusalem that had signed a non-belligerency pact with its Jewish neighbors and the Haganah, and repeatedly had barred entry to foreign irregulars.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45" title=""><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46" title=""><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> On 9 April approximately 120 Irgun and <a href="/wiki/Lehi_(group)" title="Lehi (group)">Lehi</a> members began an operation to capture the village. During the operation Irgun members shot at fleeing individuals and families. A Haganah report writes:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The conquest of the village was carried out with great cruelty. Whole families - women, old people, children - were killed. ... Some of the prisoners moved to places of detention, including women and children, were murdered viciously by their captors.</i><sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47" title=""><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>Some say that this incident was an event that accelerated the Arab exodus from Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup>Four days later, on April 13, the Arabs launched a strike on a medical convoy traveling to <a href="/wiki/Hadassah_medical_convoy_massacre" title="Hadassah medical convoy massacre">Hadassah Hospital</a>. Around 77 doctors, nurses, and other Jewish civilians were massacred.</p>
<p>The Irgun cooperated with the Haganah in the conquest of Haifa. At the regional commander's request, on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="04-21"><a href="/wiki/April_21" title="April 21">April 21</a></span> the Irgun took over an Arab post above Hadar Ha'Carmel as well as the Arab neighborhood of Wadi Nisnas, adjacent to the Lower City.</p>
<p>The Irgun acted independently in the conquest of <a href="/wiki/Jaffa" title="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> (part of the proposed Arab State according to the <a href="/wiki/UN_Partition_Plan" title="UN Partition Plan" class="mw-redirect">UN Partition Plan</a>). On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="04-25"><a href="/wiki/April_25" title="April 25">April 25</a></span> Irgun units, about 600 strong, left the Irgun base in <a href="/wiki/Ramat_Gan" title="Ramat Gan">Ramat Gan</a> towards Arab Jaffa. Difficult battles ensued, and the Irgun faced resistance from the Arabs as well as the British.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50" title=""><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> Under Amichai "Gidi" Faglin's command, the Irgun's chief operations officer, the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya, which threatened the city of <a href="/wiki/Tel_Aviv" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>. Afterwards the force continued to the sea, towards the area of the port, and using mortars, shelled the southern neighborhoods. In his report concerning the fall of Jaffa the local Arab military commander, Michel Issa, writes: 'Continuous shelling with mortars of the city by Jews for four days, beginning 25 April, […] caused inhabitants of city, unaccustomed to such bombardment, to panic and flee.'<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51" title=""><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup> According to Morris the shelling was done by the Irgun. Their objective was 'to prevent constant military traffic in the city, to break the spirit of the enemy troops [and] to cause chaos among the civilian population in order to create a mass flight'.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_52-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-52" title=""><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> High Commissioner Cunningham wrote a few days later 'It should be made clear that IZL attack with mortars was indiscriminate and designed to create panic among the civilian inhabitants'.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_52-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-52" title=""><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> These actions caused many Arab residents to flee the city, and 30 Irgun members were killed in the flight. The British demanded the evacuation of the newly conquered city, however the Irgun had previously agreed with the Haganah that British pressure would not lead to withdrawal from Jaffa and that custody of captured areas would be turned over to the Haganah. The city ultimately fell on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="05-13"><a href="/wiki/May_13" title="May 13">May 13</a></span> after Haganah forces entered the city and took control of the rest of the city, from the south - part of the <i>Hametz Operation</i> which included the conquest of a number of villages in the area. The battles in Jaffa were a great victory for the Irgun. This operation was the largest in the history of the organization, which took place in highly built up area that had many militants in shooting positions. During the battles explosives were used in order to break into homes and continue forging a way though them. Furthermore, this was the first occasion in which the Irgun had directly fought British forces, reinforced with armor and heavy weaponry. The city began these battles with a population estimated at 55,000, which shrank to some 4,100 Arab residents by the end of major hostilities. Since the Irgun captured the neighborhood of Manshiya on its own, causing the flight of many of Jaffa's residents, the Irgun took credit for the conquest of Jaffa.</p>
<p>The Irgun radio also broadcast in Arabic in order to inspire panic. On 27 March, four days before the Haganah began their big offensive against Arab centres, they warned "Arabs in urban agglomerations" that typhus, cholera and similar diseases would break out, "heavily" amongst them "in April and May."<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53" title=""><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In June 1948 the Irgun became invoved in open confrontaion with the <a href="/wiki/Haganah" title="Haganah">Haganah</a> and <a href="/wiki/Palmach" title="Palmach">Palmach</a> when they tried to land weapons from the <a href="/wiki/Altalena" title="Altalena" class="mw-redirect">Altalena</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> Several dozen members of the Irgun were killed.</p>

<p>While the strategy, tactics, and operational methods of the organization changed through the years, its primary goals were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a non-Socialist alternative to the leading Zionist organizations;</li>
<li>Eliminate or reduce the threat of Arab attacks on Jewish targets by assured and harsh retaliation for such attacks;</li>
<li>Bring to an end the British mandatory rule</li>

<p>The group went through several phases in its short lifespan, not listed above:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1948, the group was formally dissolved and its members integrated into the newly formed <a href="/wiki/Israeli_Defense_Forces" title="Israeli Defense Forces" class="mw-redirect">Israeli Defense Forces</a>.

<p>A US Military Intelligence report, dated January 1948, described Irgun recruiting tactics amongst Displaced Persons (DP) in the camps across Germany: 'Irgun ... seems to be concentrating on the DP police force. This is an old technique in Eastern Europe and in all police states. By controlling the police, a small, unscrupulous group of determined people can impose its will on a peaceful and inarticulate majority; it is done by threats, intimidation, by violence and if need be bloodshed ... they have embarked upon a course of violence within the camps.'<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57" title=""><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

They also called for the removal of plaques at the site which blame the deaths on "ignored warning calls."

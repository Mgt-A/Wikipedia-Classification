<p>Commercially insurable risks typically share seven common characteristics.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li><b>A large number of homogeneous exposure units</b>. The vast majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of very large classes. Automobile insurance, for example, covered about 175 million automobiles in the United States in 2004.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The existence of a large number of homogeneous exposure units allows insurers to benefit from the so-called “<a href="/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers" title="Law of large numbers">law of large numbers</a>,” which in effect states that as the number of exposure units increases, the actual results are increasingly likely to become close to expected results. There are exceptions to this criterion. <a href="/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London" title="Lloyd's of London">Lloyd's of London</a> is famous for insuring the life or health of actors, actresses and sports figures. Satellite Launch insurance covers events that are infrequent. Large commercial property policies may insure exceptional properties for which there are no ‘homogeneous’ exposure units. Despite failing on this criterion, many exposures like these are generally considered to be insurable.</li>
<li><b>Definite Loss</b>. The event that gives rise to the loss that is subject to the insured, at least in principle, take place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life insurance policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three <a href="/wiki/Elements" title="Elements" class="mw-redirect">elements</a>.</li>
<li><b>Accidental Loss</b>. The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be ‘pure,’ in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that contain speculative elements, such as ordinary business risks, are generally not considered insurable.</li>
<li><b>Large Loss</b>. The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses. There is little point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.</li>
<li><b>Affordable Premium</b>. If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, it is not likely that anyone will buy insurance, even if on offer. Further, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer. If there is no such chance of loss, the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance. (See the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Financial_Accounting_Standards_Board" title="Financial Accounting Standards Board">Financial Accounting Standards Board</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_FASB_Pronouncements" title="List of FASB Pronouncements" class="mw-redirect">standard number 113</a>)</li>
<li><b>Calculable Loss</b>. There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.</li>
<li><b>Limited risk of catastrophically large losses</b>. The essential risk is often aggregation. If the same event can cause losses to numerous policyholders of the same insurer, the ability of that insurer to issue policies becomes constrained, not by factors surrounding the individual characteristics of a given policyholder, but by the factors surrounding the sum of all policyholders so exposed. Typically, insurers prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base, on the order of 5 <a href="/wiki/Percentage" title="Percentage">percent</a>. Where the loss can be aggregated, or an individual policy could produce exceptionally large claims, the capital constraint will restrict an insurer's appetite for additional policyholders. The classic example is earthquake insurance, where the ability of an underwriter to issue a new policy depends on the number and size of the policies that it has already underwritten. Wind insurance in hurricane zones, particularly along coast lines, is another example of this phenomenon. In extreme cases, the aggregation can affect the entire industry, since the combined capital of insurers and reinsurers can be small compared to the needs of potential policyholders in areas exposed to aggregation risk. In commercial fire insurance it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer’s capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the <a href="/wiki/Reinsurance" title="Reinsurance">reinsurance</a> market.</li>

<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Indemnity" title="Indemnity">Indemnity</a></div>
<p>The technical definition of "indemnity" means to make whole again. There are two types of insurance contracts;</p>
<ol>
<li>an "indemnity" policy and</li>
<li>a "pay on behalf" or "on behalf of"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>The difference is significant on paper, but rarely material in practice.</p>
<p>An "indemnity" policy will never pay claims until the insured has paid out of pocket to some third party; for example, a visitor to your home slips on a floor that you left wet and sues you for $10,000 and wins. Under an "indemnity" policy the homeowner would have to come up with the $10,000 to pay for the visitor's fall and then would be "indemnified" by the insurance carrier for the out of pocket costs (the $10,000)<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Under the same situation, a "pay on behalf" policy, the insurance carrier would pay the claim and the insured (the homeowner) would not be out of pocket for anything. Most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of "pay on behalf" language<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>An entity seeking to transfer risk (an individual, corporation, or association of any type, etc.) becomes the 'insured' party once risk is assumed by an 'insurer', the insuring party, by means of a <a href="/wiki/Contract" title="Contract">contract</a>, called an insurance 'policy'. Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following elements: the parties (the insurer, the insured, the beneficiaries), the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss event covered, the amount of coverage (i.e., the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss), and exclusions (events not covered). An insured is thus said to be "<a href="/wiki/Indemnity" title="Indemnity">indemnified</a>" against the loss covered in the policy.</p>
<p>When insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a 'claim' against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the 'premium'. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims—in theory for a relatively few claimants—and for <a href="/wiki/Overhead_(business)" title="Overhead (business)">overhead</a> costs. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (i.e., reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's <a href="/wiki/Profit_(accounting)" title="Profit (accounting)">profit</a>.</p>

<p>Insurers make money in two ways: (1) through <a href="/wiki/Underwriting" title="Underwriting">underwriting</a>, the process by which insurers select the risks to insure and decide how much in premiums to charge for accepting those risks and (2) by <a href="/wiki/Investing" title="Investing">investing</a> the premiums they collect from insured parties.</p>
<p>The most complicated aspect of the insurance business is the <a href="/wiki/Underwriting" title="Underwriting">underwriting</a> of policies. Using a wide assortment of data, insurers predict the likelihood that a claim will be made against their policies and price products accordingly. To this end, insurers use <a href="/wiki/Actuarial_science" title="Actuarial science">actuarial science</a> to quantify the risks they are willing to assume and the premium they will charge to assume them. Data is analyzed to fairly accurately project the rate of future claims based on a given risk. Actuarial science uses <a href="/wiki/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Probability" title="Probability">probability</a> to analyze the risks associated with the range of perils covered, and these scientific principles are used to determine an insurer's overall exposure. Upon termination of a given policy, the amount of premium collected and the investment gains thereon minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurer's <a href="/wiki/Underwriting_profit" title="Underwriting profit">underwriting profit</a> on that policy. Of course, from the insurer's perspective, some policies are winners (i.e., the insurer pays out less in claims and expenses than it receives in premiums and investment income) and some are losers (i.e., the insurer pays out more in claims and expenses than it receives in premiums and investment income).</p>
<p>An insurer's underwriting performance is measured in its combined ratio. The loss ratio (incurred losses and loss-adjustment expenses divided by net earned premium) is added to the expense ratio (underwriting expenses divided by net premium written) to determine the company's combined ratio. The combined ratio is a reflection of the company's overall <a href="/wiki/Underwriting" title="Underwriting">underwriting</a> profitability. A combined ratio of less than 100 percent indicates underwriting profitability, while anything over 100 indicates an underwriting loss.</p>
<p>Insurance companies also earn <a href="/wiki/Investment" title="Investment">investment</a> profits on “float”. “Float” or available reserve is the amount of money, at hand at any given moment, that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not been paid out in claims. Insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest on them until claims are paid out. The <i>Association of British Insurers</i> (gathering 400 insurance companies and 94% of UK insurance services) has almost 20% of the investments in the <a href="/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange" title="London Stock Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, the underwriting loss of <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a> and <a href="/wiki/Casualty_insurance" title="Casualty insurance">casualty insurance</a> companies was $142.3 billion in the five years ending 2003. But overall profit for the same period was $68.4 billion, as the result of float. Some insurance industry insiders, most notably <a href="/wiki/Maurice_R._Greenberg" title="Maurice R. Greenberg">Hank Greenberg</a>, do not believe that it is forever possible to sustain a profit from float without an underwriting profit as well, but this opinion is not universally held. Naturally, the “float” method is difficult to carry out in an economically depressed period. Bear markets do cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards. So a poor economy generally means high insurance premiums. This tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known as the "underwriting" or <a href="/wiki/Insurance_cycle" title="Insurance cycle">insurance cycle</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Property and casualty insurers currently make the most money from their auto insurance line of business. Generally better statistics are available on auto losses and underwriting on this line of business has benefited greatly from advances in computing. Additionally, property losses in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, due to unpredictable natural catastrophes, have exacerbated this trend.</p>

<p>Finally, claims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance; it is the actual "product" paid for, though one hopes it will never need to be used. Claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or through brokers or agents. The insurer may require that the claim be filed on its own proprietary forms, or may accept claims on a standard industry form such as those produced by <a href="/wiki/ACORD" title="ACORD">ACORD</a>.</p>
<p>Insurance company claim departments employ a large number of <a href="/wiki/Claims_adjuster" title="Claims adjuster">claims adjusters</a> supported by a staff of <a href="/wiki/Records_management" title="Records management">records management</a> and <a href="/wiki/Data_entry_clerk" title="Data entry clerk">data entry clerks</a>. Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience. The adjuster undertakes a thorough investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with the insured, determines its reasonable monetary value, and authorizes payment. Adjusting liability insurance claims is particularly difficult because there is a third party involved (the plaintiff who is suing the insured) who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and in fact may regard the insurer as a <a href="/wiki/Deep_pocket" title="Deep pocket">deep pocket</a>. The adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured (either inside "house" counsel or outside "panel" counsel), monitor litigation that may take years to complete, and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement conference when requested by the judge.</p>
<p>In managing the claims handling function, insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction, administrative handling expenses, and claims overpayment leakages. As part of this balancing act, <a href="/wiki/Insurance_fraud" title="Insurance fraud">fraudulent insurance practices</a> are a major business risk that must be managed and overcome. Disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation; see <a href="/wiki/Insurance_bad_faith" title="Insurance bad faith">insurance bad faith</a>.</p>

<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/History_of_insurance" title="History of insurance">History of insurance</a></div>
<p>In some sense we can say that insurance appears simultaneously with the appearance of human society. We know of two types of economies in human societies: money economies (with markets, money, financial instruments and so on) and non-money or natural economies (without money, markets, financial instruments and so on). The second type is a more ancient form than the first. In such an economy and community, we can see insurance in the form of people helping each other. For example, if a house burns down, the members of the community help build a new one. Should the same thing happen to one's neighbour, the other neighbours must help. Otherwise, neighbours will not receive help in the future. This type of insurance has survived to the present day in some countries where modern money economy with its financial instruments is not widespread (for example countries in the territory of the former Soviet Union).</p>
<p>Turning to insurance in the modern sense (i.e., insurance in a modern money economy, in which insurance is part of the financial sphere), early methods of transferring or distributing risk were practised by <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">Chinese</a> and <a href="/wiki/Babylonia" title="Babylonia">Babylonian</a> traders as long ago as the <a href="/wiki/3rd_millennium_BC" title="3rd millennium BC">3rd</a> and <a href="/wiki/2nd_millennium_BC" title="2nd millennium BC">2nd</a> <a href="/wiki/Millennium" title="Millennium">millennia</a> BC, respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel's capsizing. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous <a href="/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi" title="Code of Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a>, c. 1750 BC, and practised by early <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean" title="Mediterranean" class="mw-redirect">Mediterranean</a> sailing <a href="/wiki/Merchant" title="Merchant">merchants</a>. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Achaemenian" title="Achaemenian" class="mw-redirect">Achaemenian</a> monarchs of Iran were the first to insure their people and made it official by registering the insuring process in governmental notary offices. The insurance tradition was performed each year in Norouz (beginning of the Iranian New Year); the heads of different ethnic groups as well as others willing to take part, presented gifts to the monarch. The most important gift was presented during a special ceremony. When a gift was worth more than 10,000 Derrik (Achaemenian gold coin) the issue was registered in a special office. This was advantageous to those who presented such special gifts. For others, the presents were fairly assessed by the confidants of the court. Then the assessment was registered in special offices.</p>
<p>The purpose of registering was that whenever the person who presented the gift registered by the court was in trouble, the monarch and the court would help him. Jahez, a historian and writer, writes in one of his books on <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Iran" title="Ancient Iran" class="mw-redirect">ancient Iran</a>: "[W]henever the owner of the present is in trouble or wants to construct a building, set up a feast, have his children married, etc. the one in charge of this in the court would check the registration. If the registered amount exceeded 10,000 Derrik, he or she would receive an amount of twice as much."<a href="http://www.iran-law.com/article.php3?id_article=61" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.iran-law.com/article.php3?id_article=61" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>A thousand years later, the inhabitants of <a href="/wiki/Rhodes" title="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> invented the concept of the '<a href="/wiki/General_average" title="General average">general average</a>'. Merchants whose goods were being shipped together would pay a proportionally divided premium which would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during storm or sinkage.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> introduced the origins of health and life insurance c. 600 AD when they organized guilds called "benevolent societies" which cared for the <a href="/wiki/Family" title="Family">families</a> and paid <a href="/wiki/Funeral" title="Funeral">funeral</a> expenses of members upon <a href="/wiki/Death" title="Death">death</a>. <a href="/wiki/Guild" title="Guild">Guilds</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> served a similar purpose. The <a href="/wiki/Talmud" title="Talmud">Talmud</a> deals with several aspects of insuring <a href="/wiki/Good_(economics)" title="Good (economics)">goods</a>. Before insurance was established in the late 17th century, "friendly societies" existed in England, in which people donated amounts of money to a general sum that could be used for emergencies.</p>
<p>Separate insurance contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts) were invented in <a href="/wiki/Genoa" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. These new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of roles that first proved useful in marine insurance. Insurance became far more sophisticated in post-<a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and specialized varieties developed.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the seventeenth century, London's growing importance as a centre for trade increased demand for marine insurance. In the late 1680s, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lloyd_(coffeehouse_owner)" title="Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)">Edward Lloyd</a> opened a coffee house that became a popular haunt of ship owners, merchants, and ships’ captains, and thereby a reliable source of the latest shipping news. It became the meeting place for parties wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. Today, <a href="/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London" title="Lloyd's of London">Lloyd's of London</a> remains the leading market (note that it is not an insurance company) for marine and other specialist types of insurance, but it works rather differently than the more familiar kinds of insurance.</p>
<p>Insurance as we know it today can be traced to the <a href="/wiki/Great_Fire_of_London" title="Great Fire of London">Great Fire of London</a>, which in 1666 devoured 13,200 houses. In the aftermath of this disaster, <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Barbon" title="Nicholas Barbon">Nicholas Barbon</a> opened an office to insure buildings. In 1680, he established England's first fire insurance company, "The Fire Office," to insure brick and frame homes.</p>
<p>The first insurance company in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> underwrote fire insurance and was formed in Charles Town (modern-day <a href="/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston</a>), <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>, in 1732. <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> helped to popularize and make standard the practice of insurance, particularly against <a href="/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a> in the form of <a href="/wiki/Perpetual_Insurance" title="Perpetual Insurance">perpetual insurance</a>. In 1752, he founded the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Contributionship_for_the_Insurance_of_Houses_from_Loss_by_Fire" title="Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire" class="mw-redirect">Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire</a>. Franklin's company was the first to make contributions toward fire prevention. Not only did his company warn against certain <a href="/wiki/Fire_hazards" title="Fire hazards" class="mw-redirect">fire hazards</a>, it refused to insure certain buildings where the risk of fire was too great, such as all wooden houses. In the United States, <a href="/wiki/Regulation" title="Regulation">regulation</a> of the insurance industry is highly <a href="/wiki/Balkanization" title="Balkanization">Balkanized</a>, with primary responsibility assumed by individual <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" title="U.S. state">state</a> insurance departments. Whereas insurance markets have become centralized nationally and internationally, state insurance commissioners operate individually, though at times in concert through a <a href="/wiki/National_Association_of_Insurance_Commissioners" title="National Association of Insurance Commissioners">national insurance commissioners' organization</a>. In recent years, some have called for a dual state and federal regulatory system (commonly referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Optional_federal_charter" title="Optional federal charter">Optional federal charter</a> (OFC)) for insurance similar to that which oversees state banks and national banks.</p>

<p>Any risk that can be quantified can potentially be insured. Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as "perils". An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are (non-exhaustive) lists of the many different types of insurance that exist. A single policy may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out below. For example, auto insurance would typically cover both property risk (covering the risk of theft or damage to the car) and liability risk (covering legal claims from causing an accident). A <a href="/wiki/Home_insurance" title="Home insurance">homeowner</a>'s insurance policy in the U.S. typically includes property insurance covering damage to the home and the owner's belongings, liability insurance covering certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Business_insurance" title="Business insurance" class="mw-redirect">Business insurance</a> can be any kind of insurance that protects businesses against risks. Some principal subtypes of business insurance are (a) the various kinds of <i>professional liability insurance</i>, also called <i>professional indemnity insurance</i>, which are discussed below under that name; and (b) the business owner's policy (BOP), which bundles into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that a business owner needs, in a way analogous to how homeowners insurance bundles the coverages that a homeowner needs.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Auto insurance protects you against financial loss if you have an accident. It is a contract between you and the insurance company. You agree to pay the premium and the insurance company agrees to pay your losses as defined in your policy. Auto insurance provides property, liability and medical coverage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Property coverage pays for damage to or theft of your car.</li>
<li>Liability coverage pays for your legal responsibility to others for bodily injury or property damage.</li>
<li>Medical coverage pays for the cost of treating injuries, rehabilitation and sometimes lost wages and funeral expenses.</li>
</ol>
<p>An auto insurance policy is comprised of six different kinds of coverage. Most countries require you to buy some, but not all, of these coverages. If you're financing a car, your lender may also have requirements. Most auto policies are for six months to a year.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, your insurance company should notify you by mail when it’s time to renew the policy and to pay your premium. <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Life insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedent's family or other designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for income to an insured person's family, <a href="/wiki/Burial" title="Burial">burial</a>, <a href="/wiki/Funeral" title="Funeral">funeral</a> and other final expenses. Life insurance policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary either in a lump sum cash payment or an annuity.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Annuity_(financial_contracts)" title="Annuity (financial contracts)" class="mw-redirect">Annuities</a> provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies and regulated as insurance and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and <a href="/wiki/Pension" title="Pension">pensions</a> that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a <a href="/wiki/Retirement" title="Retirement">retiree</a> will outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.</p>
<p>Certain life insurance contracts accumulate <a href="/wiki/Cash" title="Cash">cash</a> values, which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities and <a href="/wiki/Endowment_policy" title="Endowment policy">endowment policies</a>, are financial instruments to accumulate or <a href="/wiki/Liquidation" title="Liquidation">liquidate</a> <a href="/wiki/Wealth" title="Wealth">wealth</a> when it is needed.</p>
<p>In many countries, such as the U.S. and the UK, the <a href="/wiki/Tax_law" title="Tax law">tax law</a> provides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-efficient method of <a href="/wiki/Saving" title="Saving">saving</a> as well as protection in the event of early death.</p>
<p>In U.S., the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, in some cases the benefit derived from tax deferral may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation. A combination of low-cost term life insurance and a higher-return tax-efficient retirement account may achieve better investment return.</p>

<p>Liability insurance is a very broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.</p>

For example, professional liability insurance in reference to the medical profession may be called <i>malpractice insurance.</i> Notaries public may take out <i>errors and omissions insurance (E&amp;O).</i> Other potential E&amp;O policyholders include, for example, real estate brokers, Insurance agents, home inspectors, appraisers, and website developers.</li>

<li>Protected Self-Insurance is an alternative risk financing mechanism in which an organization retains the mathematically calculated cost of risk within the organization and transfers the catastrophic risk with specific and aggregate limits to an insurer so the maximum total cost of the program is known.

<li><a href="/wiki/Retrospectively_Rated_Insurance" title="Retrospectively Rated Insurance">Retrospectively Rated Insurance</a> is a method of establishing a premium on large commercial accounts. The final premium is based on the insured's actual loss experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a formula. Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium × tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.</li>
<li>Formal <a href="/wiki/Self_insurance" title="Self insurance">self insurance</a> is the deliberate decision to pay for otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money. This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self insurance is usually used to pay for high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.</li>

<li><a href="/wiki/Social_insurance" title="Social insurance">Social insurance</a> can be many things to many people in many countries. But a summary of its essence is that it is a collection of insurance coverages (including components of life insurance, disability income insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance, and others), plus retirement savings, that requires participation by all citizens. By forcing everyone in society to be a policyholder and pay premiums, it ensures that everyone can become a claimant when or if he/she needs to. Along the way this inevitably becomes related to other concepts such as the justice system and the <a href="/wiki/Welfare_state" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a>.

<p>Some communities prefer to create virtual insurance amongst themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values to risk. A number of <a href="/wiki/Religion" title="Religion">religious</a> groups, including the <a href="/wiki/Amish" title="Amish">Amish</a> and some <a href="/wiki/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> groups, depend on support provided by their <a href="/wiki/Community" title="Community">communities</a> when <a href="/wiki/Disaster" title="Disaster">disasters</a> strike. The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of insurance can work. In this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further justification is also provided by invoking the <a href="/wiki/Moral_hazard" title="Moral hazard">moral hazard</a> of explicit insurance contracts.</p>

If a government building was damaged, the cost of repair would be met from public funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums. Since many UK government buildings have been sold to property companies, and rented back, this arrangement is now less common and may have disappeared altogether.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Insurance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: Insurance companies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Insurance companies</span></h2>
<p>Insurance companies may be classified into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Life</i> insurance companies, which sell life insurance, annuities and pensions products.</li>
<li><i>Non-life</i>, <i>General</i>, or <i>Property/Casualty</i> insurance companies, which sell other types of insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>General insurance companies can be further divided into these sub categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Lines</li>
<li>Excess Lines</li>
</ul>
<p>In most countries, life and non-life insurers are subject to different regulatory regimes and different <a href="/wiki/Tax" title="Tax">tax</a> and <a href="/wiki/Accounting" title="Accounting" class="mw-redirect">accounting</a> rules. The main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life, annuity, and pension business is very long-term in nature — coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many <a href="/wiki/Decade" title="Decade">decades</a>. By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.</p>
<p>In the United States, standard line insurance companies are "mainstream" insurers. These are the companies that typically insure autos, homes or businesses. They use pattern or "cookie-cutter" policies without variation from one person to the next. They usually have lower premiums than excess lines and can sell directly to individuals. They are regulated by state laws that can restrict the amount they can charge for insurance policies.</p>
<p>Excess line insurance companies (aka Excess and Surplus) typically insure risks not covered by the standard lines market. They are broadly referred as being all insurance placed with non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurers are not licensed in the states where the risks are located. These companies have more flexibility and can react faster than standard insurance companies because they are not required to file rates and forms as the "admitted" carriers do. However, they still have substantial regulatory requirements placed upon them. State laws generally require insurance placed with surplus line agents and brokers not to be available through standard licensed insurers.</p>
<p>Insurance companies are generally classified as either <i><a href="/wiki/Mutual_insurance" title="Mutual insurance">mutual</a></i> or <i>stock</i> companies. Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while stockholders (who may or may not own policies) own stock insurance companies. <a href="/wiki/Demutualization" title="Demutualization">Demutualization</a> of mutual insurers to form stock companies, as well as the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century. Other possible forms for an insurance company include <i><a href="/wiki/Reciprocal_inter-insurance_exchange" title="Reciprocal inter-insurance exchange">reciprocals</a></i>, in which policyholders 'reciprocate' in sharing risks, and Lloyds organizations.</p>
<p>Insurance companies are rated by various agencies such as <a href="/wiki/A._M._Best" title="A. M. Best">A. M. Best</a>. The ratings include the company's financial strength, which measures its ability to pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Reinsurance" title="Reinsurance">Reinsurance</a></i> companies are insurance companies that sell policies to other insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from very large losses. The reinsurance market is dominated by a few very large companies, with huge reserves. A reinsurer may also be a direct writer of insurance risks as well.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Captive_insurance" title="Captive insurance">Captive insurance</a></i> companies may be defined as limited-purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a "pure" entity (which is a 100% subsidiary of the self-insured parent company); of a "mutual" captive (which insures the collective risks of members of an industry); and of an "association" captive (which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association). Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>The types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include property damage, public and product liability, professional indemnity, employee benefits, employers' liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captive's exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance.</p>
<p>Captives are becoming an increasingly important component of the risk management and risk financing strategy of their parent. This can be understood against the following background:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy and increasing premium costs in almost every line of coverage;</li>
<li>difficulties in insuring certain types of fortuitous risk;</li>
<li>differential coverage standards in various parts of the world;</li>
<li>rating structures which reflect market trends rather than individual loss experience;</li>
<li>insufficient credit for deductibles and/or loss control efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also companies known as 'insurance consultants'. Like a mortgage broker, these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. Similar to an insurance consultant, an 'insurance broker' also shops around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. However, with insurance brokers, the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client.</p>
<p>Neither insurance consultants nor insurance brokers are insurance companies and no risks are transferred to them in insurance transactions. Third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies. These companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have.</p>
<p>The financial stability and strength of an insurance company should be a major consideration when buying an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future. For that reason, the viability of the insurance carrier is very important. In recent years, a number of insurance companies have become insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage (or coverage only from a government-backed insurance pool or other arrangement with less attractive payouts for losses). A number of independent rating agencies, such as <a href="http://www.ambest.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ambest.com/" rel="nofollow">Best's</a>, <a href="http://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/corporate/AboutFitch.faces?context=1&amp;detail=1" class="external text" title="http://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/corporate/AboutFitch.faces?context=1&amp;detail=1" rel="nofollow">Fitch</a>, <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com" class="external text" title="http://www.standardandpoors.com" rel="nofollow">Standard &amp; Poor's</a>, and <a href="http://www.moodys.com/moodys/cust/AboutMoodys/AboutMoodys.aspx?topic=intro&amp;redir_url=/cust/AboutMoodys/staticRedirect.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.moodys.com/moodys/cust/AboutMoodys/AboutMoodys.aspx?topic=intro&amp;redir_url=/cust/AboutMoodys/staticRedirect.asp" rel="nofollow">Moody's Investors Service</a>, provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.</p>

Non-life insurance premia written in 2005</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Global insurance premiums grew by 11% in 2007 (or 3.3% in real terms) to reach $4.1 trillion. The macro-economic environment was characterised by slower economic growth in 2007 and rising inflation. Profitability improved in life insurance and fell slighlty in the non-life sector during the year. Life insurance premiums grew by 12.6%, accelerating in the advanced economies with the exception of Japan and Continental Europe. Non-life insurance premiums grew by 7.6% during the year. Figures for premium income are not yet available for 2008, but the insurance industry is likely to see a slowdown in new business and falling investment revenue.</p>
<p>Advanced economies account for the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1,681bn, Europe was the most important region, followed by North America ($1,330bn) and Asia ($814bn). The top four countries accounted for nearly 60% of premiums in 2007. The US and UK alone accounted for 42% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging markets accounted for over 85% of the world’s population but generated only around 10% of premiums.</p>

<p>By creating a "security blanket" for its insureds, an insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk-averse as they might otherwise be (since, by definition, the insured has transferred the risk to the insurer,) a concept known as <a href="/wiki/Moral_hazard" title="Moral hazard">moral hazard</a>. To reduce their own financial exposure, insurance companies have contractual clauses that mitigate their obligation to provide coverage if the insured engages in behavior that grossly magnifies their risk of loss or liability.</p>
<p>For example, life insurance companies may require higher premiums or deny coverage altogether to people who work in hazardous occupations or engage in dangerous sports. Liability insurance providers do not provide coverage for liability arising from <a href="/wiki/Intentional_tort" title="Intentional tort">intentional torts</a> committed by the insured. Even if a provider were so irrational as to want to provide such coverage, it is against the public policy of most countries to allow such insurance to exist, and thus it is usually illegal.</p>

<p>Insurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees and coverages included in a policy. As a result, people may buy policies on unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business, including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may be <a href="/wiki/Advertising" title="Advertising">advertised</a> and sold.</p>
<p>For example, most insurance policies in the English language today have been carefully drafted in <a href="/wiki/Plain_English" title="Plain English">plain English</a>; the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying.</p>
<p>Many institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker. While on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer (not the insurance company), and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations, it should be noted that in the vast majority of cases a broker's compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium, creating a conflict of interest in that the broker's financial interest is tilted towards encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers, thereby allowing the broker to "shop" the <a href="/wiki/Market" title="Market">market</a> for the best rates and coverage possible.</p>
<p>Insurance may also be purchased through an agent. Unlike a broker, who represents the policyholder, an agent represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys. An agent can represent more than one company.</p>
<p>An independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a fee-for-service retainer, similar to an attorney, and thus offers completely independent advice, free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers and/or agents. However, such a consultant must still work through brokers and/or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Insurance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25" title="Edit section: Redlining">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Redlining</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Redlining" title="Redlining">Redlining</a> is the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas, supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss, while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination. <a href="/wiki/Racial_profiling" title="Racial profiling">Racial profiling</a> or <a href="/wiki/Redlining" title="Redlining">redlining</a> has a long history in the property insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>All states have provisions in their rate regulation laws or in their fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination, often called redlining, in setting rates and making insurance available.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In determining premiums and premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location, <a href="/wiki/Credit_score" title="Credit score">credit scores</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a>, <a href="/wiki/Profession" title="Profession">occupation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marital_status" title="Marital status">marital status</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a> level. However, the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully <a href="/wiki/Discriminatory" title="Discriminatory" class="mw-redirect">discriminatory</a>, and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.</p>
<p>An insurance underwriter's job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Thus, "discrimination" against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting. For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently than younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the risk premium must be higher to cover the greater risk. However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p>What is often missing from the debate is that prohibiting the use of legitimate, actuarially sound factors means that an insufficient amount is being charged for a given risk, and there is thus a deficit in the system.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> The failure to address the deficit may mean insolvency and hardship for all of a company's insureds.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> The options for addressing the deficit seem to be the following: Charge the deficit to the other policyholders or charge it to the government (i.e., externalize outside of the company to society at large).<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>Many insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them. <a href="/wiki/The_Hartford" title="The Hartford">The Hartford</a> insurance company, for example, recently had to pay $80 million to an independent inventor, Bancorp Services, in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by Bancorp.</p>

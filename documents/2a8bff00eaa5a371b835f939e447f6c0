<p>The <a href="http://www.wfot.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wfot.org" rel="nofollow">World Federation of Occupational Therapists</a>defines occupational therapy as a profession concerned with promoting health and well-being through occupation. The primary goal of occupational therapy is to enable people to participate in the activities of everyday life. Occupational therapists achieve this outcome by enhancing the individual's ability to participate, by modifying the environment, or by adapting the activity to better support participation.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Another way of thinking about the ideas contained in these definitions could be: occupational therapy is about understanding the importance of an activity to an individual, being able to analyze the physical, mental and social components of the activity and then adapting the activity, the environment and/or the person to enable them to resume the activity. Occupational therapists would ask, "Why does this person have difficulties managing his or her daily activities (or occupations), and what can we adapt to make it possible for him or her to manage better and how will this then impact his or her health and well-being?”</p>
<p>Occupational therapy gives people the "skills for the job of living" necessary for "living life to its fullest."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The College of Occupational Therapists (2004) describes OT as follows: Occupational Therapy enables people to achieve health, well-being and life satisfaction through participation in occupation.</p>
<p>Occupational Therapy draws from the field of <a href="/wiki/Occupational_science" title="Occupational science">occupational science</a> to provide an evidence base to practice and develop academic and practice links to other related disciplines such as social science and anthropology, and also utilises a range of generic models to guide the practice of OT.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Occupational_therapy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: History of occupational therapy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History of occupational therapy</span></h2>
<p>The earliest evidence of using occupations as a therapeutic modality can be found in ancient times. One-hundred years before the birth of Christ, Greek physician Asclepiades initiated humane treatment of patients with mental illness via the use of therapeutic baths, massage, exercise, and music. Later, the Roman Celsus prescribed music, travel, conversation and exercise to his patients. Unfortunately, by medieval times, the concept of humane treatment of people considered to be insane was rare, if not nonexistent (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>In eighteenth century Europe, revolutionaries such as Philippe Pinel and Johann Christian Reil reformed the hospital system. Instead of the use of metal chains and restraint, their institutions utilized rigorous work and leisure activities in the late 1700s. Although it was thriving abroad, interest in the reform movement waxed and waned in the United States throughout the nineteeth century. At the turn of the 20th century, as physicians became increasingly interested in chronic disease, enthusiasm for the reform of the mental healthcare system was revived in the states. Work therapy found its way to America (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>The health profession of occupational therapy as we know it was conceived in the early 1910s. Focus was on promoting health in “invalids.” Early professionals merged highly valued ideals, such as having a strong work ethic and the importance of crafting with one’s own hands, with scientific and medical principles. Early adversaries viewed wood carving and crafting by ill patients trivial (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>The emergence of occupational therapy challenged the views of mainstream scientific medicine. Instead of focusing on purely physical etiologies, they argued that a complex combination of social, economic, and biological reasons cause dysfunction. Principles and techniques were borrowed from many disciplines—including but not limited to nursing, psychiatry, rehabilitation, self-help, orthopedics, and social work—to enrich the profession’s scope. Between 1900 and 1930, the founders defined the realm of practice and developed theories of practice. In a short 20-year span, they successfully convinced the public and medical world of the value of occupational therapy and established standards for the profession (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>A substantial lack of primary sources of information has left today’s occupational therapists with many questions concerning the founders of the field. Information is collected from early training institutions and hospitals, professional writings of practitioners, World War I records from government agencies, newspaper articles, and personal testimonials (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>One of the most notable figures in the infancy of occupational therapy was Eleanor Clark Slagle. Slagle was part of the generation of women who challenged women’s “rightful” place as a volunteer and strived for females to have a place in the professional world. At age forty, she was trained in curative occupations and recreations at the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy and later took a position at Hull House, where crafts were used to promote mental health (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>It is speculated that Slagle’s interest in healthcare stemmed from her personal life, as her father, brother, and nephew all suffered from various disabilities. Seeing the daily struggles of people with disabilities and illnesses may have sparked Slagle to enroll in the Chicago School in 1911. In 1912, renowned psychiatrist Adolph Meyer appointed Slagle to direct a new department of occupational therapy at John Hopkins Hospital. There, she learned habit training—a method of re-educating patients on decent habits of living via substituting healthful habits for bad habits (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>Another psychiatrist, William Rush Dunton, Jr., worked diligently to raise the status of psychiatry in medicine in the first decades of the 20th century. He viewed occupational therapy as complementary to psychiatry, as it had the promise of meshing humanitarian values with science. Dunton became interested in the work of European moral therapy advocates. He accepted a position at the Sheppard Asylum, where it was standard practice in the early 1900s for patients to participate in activities such as bowling, gymnastics, art, etc. Dunton and his contemporaries called for the development of a theory to underlie the treatment known as “moral therapy” and “diversional occupation,” among other names. He called for therapists to devise outcome measures so that the neophyte profession would be given the attention and respect he felt it deserved (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>Another important figure in the early days of occupational therapy was Susan Tracy, a nurse by trade, who organized activity-oriented classes for nurses at the Adams Nervine Asylum. In 1910, she published a textbook that was widely used for over 30 years. She is credited with expanding the realm of occupational therapy from psychiatric institutions to the homes of patients, which is an important setting in which today’s occupational therapists work. Upon breaking ties with the asylum, she set up her own institution, entitled the Experiment Station for the Study of Invalid Occupations. This training center educated nurses so they could gain control over their practice and not default to being dominated by physicians. By practicing privately in patients’ homes, this batch of occupational therapists expanded the domain of occupational therapy and began using OT to treat physical ailments as well as mental illness (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>Herbert J. Hall was a physician with a strong work ethic and practical vision. He believed we could retract social ills by adapting the arts and crafts movement for medical purposes. A graduate of Harvard Medical School, he advised the government on wartime standards for occupational therapy during WWI. He introduced the concept of grading activities—now a hallmark of occupational therapy—to avoid exacerbating patient’s frustration and fatigue (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>George Edward Barton, an architect, also aided in promoting the occupational therapy profession. Diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1901, Barton later contracted gangrene and had a partial amputation, after which he was left paralyzed on his left side. He opened Consolation House, a sanctuary for people with physical disabilities, in 1914. There, intensive self-administered occupational therapy “cured” his ailments. He played an integral part in gathering the profession’s leaders and forming the first national society (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>The first meeting of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy was held in March of 1917. Barton (along with his secretary), Eleanor Clark Slagle, William Rush Dunton Jr., Thomas B. Kinder, and Susan Cox Johnson were the only six in attendance. In the fall of 1919, at the third meeting, 300 attendees participated. In 1921, the name of the organization was changed to the American Occupational Therapy Association and the Archives of Occupational Therapy, the first professional journal, began publication (Quiroga, 1995).</p>
<p>World War I forced the new profession to clarify its role in the medical domain and to standardize training and practice. In addition to clarifying its public image, OT also established clinics, workshops, and training schools nationwide. Due to the overwhelming number of wartime injuries, “reconstruction aides” (an umbrella term for physical therapists and occupational therapists) were recruited by the Surgeon General. Between 1917 and 1920, nearly 148,000 wounded men were placed in hospitals upon their return to the states. This number does not account for those wounded abroad. The success of the reconstruction aides, largely made up of women trying to “do their bit” to help with the war effort, was a great accomplishment. Post-war, however, there was a struggle to keep people in the profession. Emphasis was shifted from the altruistic war-time mentality to the financial, professional, and personal satisfaction that comes with being a therapist. To make the profession more appealing, practice was standardized, as was the curriculum. Entry and exit criterion were established, and AOTA advocated for steady employment, decent wages, and fair working conditions. Via these methods, occupational therapy sought and obtained medical legitimacy in the 1920s. By the time Slagle retired from the profession in 1937, the profession’s medical identity was well on its way to being established (Quiroga, 1995).</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> of occupational therapy has evolved over the history of the profession.

<p>William Rush Dunton, the creator of the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy, now the American Occupational Therapy Association, sought to promote the ideas that occupation is a basic human need, and that occupation was therapeutic. From his statements, came some of the basic assumptions of occupational therapy, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Occupation has an effect on health and well-being.</li>
<li>Occupation creates structure and organizes time.</li>
<li>Occupation brings meaning to life, culturally and personally.</li>
<li>Occupations are individual. People value different occupations<sup id="cite_ref-Townsend_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Townsend-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These have been elaborated over time to form the values which underpin the Codes of Ethics issued by each national association. However, the relevance of occupation to health and well-being remains the central theme. Influenced by criticism from medicine and the multitude of physical disabilities resulting from <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> , occupational therapy adopted a more <a href="/wiki/Reductionistic" title="Reductionistic" class="mw-redirect">reductionistic</a> philosophy for a time. While this approach lead to developments in technical knowledge about occupational performance, clinicians became increasingly disillusioned and re-considered these beliefs<sup id="cite_ref-Turner_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Turner-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Punwar_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Punwar-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>. As a result, client centeredness and occupation are re-emerging as dominant themes in the profession, perhaps indicating growing maturity and self confidence<sup id="cite_ref-Douglas_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Douglas-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Whiteford_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Whiteford-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Polatajko_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Polatajko-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>. Over the past century, the underlying philosophy of occupational therapy has evolved from being a diversion from illness, to treatment, to enablement through meaningful occupation<sup id="cite_ref-Townsend_0-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Townsend-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>. This became evident through the development and widespread adoption of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_model_of_occupational_performance" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_model_of_occupational_performance" rel="nofollow">Canadian Model of Occupational Performance</a>.</p>
<p>The two most commonly mentioned values are that occupation is essential for health and the concept of <a href="/wiki/Holism" title="Holism">holism</a>. However, there have been some dissenting voices. Mocellin in particular advocated abandoning the notion of health through occupation as obsolete in the modern world and questioned the appropriateness of advocating holism when practice rarely supports it<sup id="cite_ref-Mocellin1_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mocellin1-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Mocellin2_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mocellin2-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Mocellin3_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mocellin3-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup>. The values formulated by the American Association of Occupational Therapists have also been critiqued as being therapist centred and not reflecting the modern reality of multicultural practice<sup id="cite_ref-Kielhofner_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kielhofner-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hocking.2FWhiteford_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hocking.2FWhiteford-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Central to the philosophy of occupational therapy is the concept of occupational performance. In considering occupational performance the therapist must consider the many factors which comprise overall performance. This concept is made more tangible using models such as the person-environment-occupation model proposed by Law et al. (1996)<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup>. This approach highlights the importance of satisfactions in one's occupations, broadening the aim of occupational therapy beyond the mere completion of tasks to the holistic achievement of personal wellbeing.</p>
<p>In recent times occupational therapists have challenged themselves to think more broadly about the potential scope of the profession, and expanded it to include working with groups experiencing <a href="/w/index.php?title=Occupational_deprivation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Occupational deprivation (page does not exist)">occupational deprivation</a> which stems from sources other than disability<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>.

<p>Many people see the term occupation as a job one does. However, the meaning of occupation is seen in a much wider context by an Occupational Therapist. A human being can be engaged in a wide range of occupations: leisure, self-care or educational activities are just a few examples of occupation.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><b>Occupational Form</b></p>

<p>The role of Occupational Therapy allows OT’s to work in many different settings, work with many different populations and acquire many different specialties. This broad spectrum of practice lends itself to difficulty categorizing the areas of practice that exist, especially because each country, each with a different healthcare system. In this section, the categorization from the American Occupational Therapy Association is used. However there are other ways to categorize areas of practice in OT, such as physical, mental, and community practice (AOTA, 2009). These divisions occur when the setting is defined by the population it serves for example acute physical or mental health settings (e.g.: hospitals), sub-acute settings (e.g.: aged care facilities), outpatient clinics and community settings.</p>

<li><a href="/wiki/Pediatrics" title="Pediatrics">Pediatrics</a> - Schools, Community, inpatient hospital based child OT: Often, children need OT services for the same reasons an adult needs OT services. However, OTs approach intervention in a different way with children. OT delivers approaches treatment through occupation, and the occupations of a child are different from those of an adult; and include play, chores, self-care and schoolwork (Case-Smith, 2005). Common conditions that are specific to or more common in the pediatric population creating a need for OT services include: developmental disorders, sensory regulation or sensory processing deficits, fine motor developmental delays or deficits, autism (Case-Smith, 2005), emotional and behavioral disturbances (Lambert, 2005), among others. In addition, children are seen for every injury, illness or chronic condition that may cause a person of any age to have performance deficits in their daily life and thus benefit from OT services (Case-Smith, 2005).</li>
<li>Acute care hospitals</li>
<li>Inpatient <a href="/wiki/Rehabilitation" title="Rehabilitation">rehabilitation</a> (e.g., Spinal Cord Injuries):People with disabilities have the right and the privilege to live meaningful purposeful lives. When a disability occurs it is sometimes possible to recover – when it is not it is important to learn the skills to adapt capacity and environmental supports to be able to participate. OTs use their knowledge to help both with recovery and adaptation.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Rehabilitation" title="Rehabilitation">Rehabilitation</a> centers (e.g., Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Stroke (CVA), Spinal Cord Injuries, Head Injuries)</li>
<li>Skilled nursing facilities: An occupational therapists role in a skilled nursing facility is centered on each client’s individual needs. Many of the skills an OT works on are known as activities of daily living or self-care such as feeding or dressing. OTs can provide equipment to assist with activities or offer expertise in modifying the environment to maximize independence and facilitate independence. Other OT roles include education in adaptive equipment (shower bench), energy conservation, or task simplification (Hofmann, 2008).</li>
<li>Home Health</li>
<li>Outpatient clinics (e.g., Hand Therapy, <a href="/wiki/Orthopaedics" title="Orthopaedics" class="mw-redirect">orthopaedics</a>)</li>
<li>Specialist assessment centres (e.g., Electronic <a href="/wiki/Assistive_technology" title="Assistive technology">assistive technology</a>, Posture and Mobility services)</li>
<li>Hospices: An occupational therapists common role in hospice care is modifying and preventing. Modifying the demands of the activity to fit with the abilities of the client. The intervention may be directly with the client or with the client and the client’s caregivers. OT can offer the caregivers support an education. Progress is defined as improved quality of life in hospice care. (Hasselkaus, 1998)</li>
<li>Assisted Living Facilities: In an assisted living facility OT services are provided by a home health agency, rehab agency, or a private practice. Medicare and some private insurance plans cover OT services in ALFs. Areas of treatment intervention often include: bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, mobility, money management, laundry, and community participation. Can treat persons with occupational performance decline or at risk for a decline. Increase quality of life so less residents need the services of a long-term SNF. Special areas include mobility device assessment (scooter), continence training, psychosocial needs and low vision programs (Fagan, 2001).</li>
<li>Productive Aging: An OT practicing in this area would provide skills and services to older adults to maximize independence, participation, and quality of life. Typical issues addressed: Any impairment or condition that would limit their ability to carry out meaningful occupations and tasks that are necessary for daily life. Skills taught include: energy conservation, education in adaptive equipment (such as a shower bench), task simplification, adapting and modifying activities to progress with a client’s changing abilities (Opp Hoffman, 2008), caregiver education and support (AOTA, 2004), safety, social interactions and communication, memory skills training (Glantz &amp; Richman, 2007), mobility device assessment and training (i.e. scooters, wheelchairs, walkers), low vision interventions, continence training, and facilitating performance in basic ADL and IADL (Fagan, 2001).</li>

<p>According to Medicare (2005) guidance, “Only a qualified occupational therapist has the knowledge, training, and experience required to evaluate and, as necessary, re-evaluate a patient’s level of function, determine whether an occupational therapy program could reasonably be expected to improve, restore, or compensate for lost function, and where appropriate, recommend to the physician a plan of treatment.”</p>
<p>According to the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), occupational therapists work with the Mental Health population throughout the life span and across many treatment settings where mental health services and psychiatric rehabilitation are provided (AOTA, 2009). Just as with other clients, the OT facilitates maximum independence in activities of daily living (dressing, grooming, etc) and instrumental activities of daily living (medication management, grocery shopping, etc). According to the American Occupational Therapy Association, OT improves functional capacity and quality of life for people with mental illness in the areas of employment, education, community living, and home and personal care through the use of real life activities in therapy treatments (AOTA, 2005).</p>
<p>Geriatric, Adult, Adolescents, and Children with any kind of mental illness or mental health issues. These conditions include but are not limited to: Schizophrenia, substance abuse, addiction, dementia, Alzheimer’s, mood disorders, personality disorders, psychoses, eating disorders, anxiety disorders (including post-traumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder) (Cara &amp; MacRae, 2005), and reactive attachment disorder (children only) (Lambert, 2005).</p>
<p>Typical issues that are addressed are as follows: Helping people acquire the skills to care for themselves or others including; keeping a schedule, medication management, employment, education, increasing community participation, community access (grocery store, library, bank, etc.), money management skills, engaging in productive activities to fill the day, coping skills, routine building, building social skills, and childcare (Cara &amp; MacRae, 2005).</p>

<li>Dementia &amp; Alzheimer Care: OTs focus on adapting activities as the client progresses through the illness (Hofmann, 2008) OT also works with caregivers to teach them how to grade activities to the client’s ability. Interventions are based on using the client’s strengths to increase their quality of life and their relationships with caregivers. Use of social interactions, communication, memory, safety and self maintenance. (Glantz &amp; Richman, 2007)</li>

<p>Community based practice involves working with people in their own environment rather than in a hospital setting. It often combines the knowledge and skills related to physical and mental health. It can also involve working with atypical populations such as the homeless or at-risk populations. Examples of community-based practice settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health promotion and lifestyle change: Remaining healthy is the goal of all people in a society, including people with chronic disabling or health conditions. Achieving health requires skills to self-manage conditions that might limit their ability to function in daily life. The occupational therapist helps people acquire these skills (Wilcock, 2005).</li>
<li>Private Practice</li>
<li>Aging in place: Occupational therapists implement environmental modifications in senior housing, assisted living, long-term-care facilities, and homes (Yamkovenko, 2008) Environmental modifications can include rearranging furniture, building ramps, widening doorways, grab bars, special toilet seats, and other safety equipment to use performance capabilities to their fullest (Moyers &amp; Christiansen, 2004).</li>
<li>Low Vision: Occupational therapists help clients use their remaining vision to complete their daily routines with compensation, remediation, disability prevention and health promotion. Compensations or that modifications to the environment may include proper lighting, color contrast, reducing clutter and education on adaptive equipment (Golembiewski, 2004).</li>
<li>Intermediate care services</li>
<li>Driving Centers: Driving is an instrumental activity of daily living and an occupational therapist may evaluate and treat skills needed to drive such as vision, executive function or memory. If a client needs more skilled assessment and training they would refer them to an OT Driver Rehabilitation Specialist which could do on the road assessment, training in adaptive equipment and make more specific recommendations.</li>
<li>Day centres</li>
<li>Schools</li>
<li>Child development centres</li>
<li>People's own homes, carrying out therapy and providing equipment and adaptations</li>
<li>Work and Industry: To be a healthy successful worker there must be a person environment fit between the task, the equipment, and the person’s skills. Occupational therapists work to achieve that fit (Ellexson, 2000; Clinger, Dodson, Maltchev, &amp; Page, 2007). Populations, conditions, and diagnoses: People of working age and ability who have been born with or developed a condition, injury, or illness that compromises their ability to work (Ellexson, 2000; Clinger, Dodson, Maltchev, &amp; Page, 2007). Settings: Return to work programs, large organizations, consultants to large organizations, work hardening programs, work conditioning programs, transitional return to work programs (Ellexson, 2000; Clinger, Dodson, Maltchev, &amp; Page, 2007). Typical issues addressed: assessment of ability to work, interventions to enhancing work performance by means of work hardening, work conditioning, and improvement of ergonomics in the workplace, identification of accommodations necessary to return-to-work following illness or injury, prevention of work related injury, illness, or disability (Ellexson, 2000; Clinger, Dodson, Maltchev, &amp; Page, 2007).</li>

<p>Occupational therapists use therapeutic activity or therapeutic occupation to improve an individual's occupational performance and increase function in activities of daily living (ADLs).</p>
<p>A core and unique feature of occupational therapy practice is the use of occupation as a therapeutic medium<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup>. An occupational therapy core skill as defined by The College of Occupational Therapists (COT) is the use of activity as a therapeutic tool<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Occupational therapists have utilized activities, such as crafts, since the profession was founded<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup>. The arts and crafts movement in the very early 20th century had ascertained that goal directed activity had a curative effect on the social problems inherent in the newly industrialized societies. The founders of the occupational therapy profession extended this thinking to the treatment of individuals' with mental health problems and as a consequence between 1920 and 1940 much of occupational therapy practice concentrated around the use of crafts as purposeful activities<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup>. The emergence of occupational therapy in physical medicine began during World War II and craft activities were utilized to rehabilitate injured soldiers<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup>. This method of practice was later termed by Mosey<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> as activity synthesis.</p>
<p>Activity synthesis or occupational synthesis is the core of occupational therapy practice; occupational therapists, in collaboration with clients, design occupational forms to produce a therapeutic occupation or activity, that is meaningful and purposeful to the client<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup>. The therapeutic activity or occupation may be used to assess the client’s occupational needs or to achieve a therapeutic goal. The component parts of an activity or occupation are matched with the required occupational performance outcomes. For example, the muscle movements elicited by pottery may address fine motor and gross motor skills to improve shoulder flexion and extension, range of movement and elbow extension and flexion.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Other therapeutic activities or occupations may include cookery activities, such as making a smoothie or a healthy soup. The components of this activity such as planning and following a recipe may address cognitive components of occupational performance such as problem solving, sequencing and learning. Health may be promoted through this occupation, enabling clients to consider healthy eating issues<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup>. Occupational therapists may further use therapeutic activities or occupations to assess occupational performance. For example, an occupational therapist may ask a client to make a cup of tea or prepare a simple meal to assess performance in activities of daily living (ADLs). An occupational therapist may use a board or card game to assess cognitive components of occupational performance. This application of therapeutic activity/occupation involves use of the core skills of the occupational therapist, chiefly assessment and problem solving<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p>Occupational Therapists use a number of theoretical frameworks to frame their practice. Note that terminology has differed between scholars. Theoretical bases for framing a human and their occupation being include the following:</p>

<p>In many countries, occupational therapists are educated at the baccalaureate level, however currently in United States and Canada entry level is at the master’s level. This change occurred in 2004, requiring all occupational therapists who started their educational program after 2004 to continue their education beyond a four-year degree. Currently, six schools in the US offer a clinical doctorate for those who would like to further their education past the Master’s level.</p>
<p>All occupational therapists have a well-rounded knowledge of biomedical, behavioral, environmental and occupational scientists. Occupational therapist base their interventions on the knowledge based on neuroscience, anatomy, applied technology, policy and environmental strategies.</p>

<p>Employment: 	According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupational therapists held 99,000 positions in 2006 (2009). States with the most licensed and employed occupational therapists are California, New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. In 2006, 52.6% of occupational therapists worked in hospitals, early intervention facilities and schools (American Occupational Therapy Association, 2006). The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that 78% of occupational therapists worked full-time in 2006 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009). In addition, the median number of years of experience for occupational therapists was 13 years (American Occupational Therapy Association, 2006). Occupational therapists can work in many different settings, some examples include: o	Hospitals o	Schools o	Early intervention facilities o	Skilled nursing facilities o	Home health care services o	Outpatient care centers o	Government agencies o	Private practice</p>
<p>The field of occupational therapy is projected to see faster growth than other careers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of jobs will grow to 122,000 in 2016 (2009). Areas of occupational therapy that involve helping older adults will see the most growth. This expansion is due to the large need to provide health care services to the aging baby boom generation (American Occupational Therapy Association, n.d.; Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009). In addition, the area of school-based occupational therapy will see growth as well. In light of a troubled economy the future of occupational therapy appears to be very promising.</p>
<p>Earnings: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2006 the average salary was $60,470 for occupational therapists (2009). The average starting entry-level salary for occupational therapists was $46,300 (American Occupational Therapy Association, n.d.). In 2006, the salaries of occupational therapists in the 50% percentile ranged from $50,450 to $73,710 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, n.d.). Salary varies according to the setting and the following represents average salaries for some practice areas: o	Hospitals							$61,610 o	School setting						$54,260 o	Nursing care services					$64,750 o	Home Health care					$67,600 o	Facilities of physical, occupational Speech therapists						$62,290 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009)</p>
<p>In addition, according to the Work Force Survey conducted by the American Occupational Therapy Association in 2006, average salaries for some other areas include: o	Mental Health						$53,750 o	Academic							$66,000 (American Occupational Therapy Association, 2006)</p>

<p>A key challenge for occupational therapy is to develop and maintain a definition of its nature and scope. Cara and MacRae (2002) <sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45" title=""><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> assert that whilst this presents a challenge, it also results in a unique flexibility which allows the discipline to move with the flow of social, cultural and environmental change. This difficulty in definition may be a cause of chronic strain for practitioners <sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46" title=""><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> and may also contribute to a lack of role definition and subsequent blurring <sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47" title=""><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent literature has also called for occupational therapy to address the political nature of who we are and what we do (Kronenberg &amp; Pollard, 2005).</p>
<p><a name="Occupational_therapy_and_the_International_Classification_of_Functioning.2C_Disability_and_Health_.28ICF.29" id="Occupational_therapy_and_the_International_Classification_of_Functioning.2C_Disability_and_Health_.28ICF.29"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Occupational_therapy&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19" title="Edit section: Occupational therapy and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Occupational therapy and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)</span></h2>
<p>The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is an outcome measure for health and occupation and illustrates how these components impact one’s function. This relates very closely to the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework as it is stated, “The profession’s core beliefs are in the positive relationship between occupation and health and its view of people as occupational beings” (2008). The ICF is also built into the 2nd edition of the practice framework. Activities and participation examples from the ICF overlap Areas of Occupation, Performance Skills, and Performance Patterns in the framework. The ICF also includes contextual factors (environmental and personal factors) that relate to the context in the framework. In addition, Body functions and structures classified within the ICF help describe the client factors as described in the OT framework (AOTA, 2002).</p>
<p>Further exploration of the relationship between occupational therapy and the components of the ICIDH-2 (revision of the original International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH); later becoming the ICF) was conducted by McLaughlin Gray (2001). First, the ICF is an international framework and provides an opportunity for the occupational therapy field to become better known across the globe. Second, the ICF provides occupational therapists with a global language to describe their expertise to the larger international health care community. The ICF uses a positive, holistic language emphasizing skills, capacities, and strengths of an individual rather than focusing on one’s deficits and disabilities. This is similar to the outlook of occupational therapists. Third, the ICF includes environmental and personal contextual factors which are incorporated into the theory behind occupational therapy. It is important to take into consideration an individual’s personal, environmental, and occupational factors to develop an effective intervention (Christiansen &amp; Baum, 2005). The last notable application of the ICF to occupational therapy is the recognition of cultural patterns in occupation. Culture has significance on an individual’s activities and participation and it is important to keep this in mind when treating an individual.</p>
<p>Although the ICF can be very useful for occupational therapists, it is noted in the literature that occupational therapists should use specific occupational therapy vocabulary along with the ICF in order to ensure correct communication about specific concepts (Stamm, Cieza, Machold, Smolen, &amp; Stucki, 2006). The ICF might lack certain categories to describe what occupational therapists need to communicate to clients and colleagues. It also may not be possible to exactly match the connotations of the ICF categories to occupational therapy terms. The ICF is not an assessment and specialized occupational therapy vocabulary should not be replaced with ICF terminology. (Haglund &amp; Henriksson, 2003). The ICF is an overarching framework on which to hang current therapy practices.</p>

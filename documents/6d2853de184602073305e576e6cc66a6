<p>In <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling" title="Professional wrestling">professional wrestling</a>, <b>kayfabe</b> is the portrayal of events within the industry as "real", that is, the portrayal of professional wrestling as being genuine or not <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#W" title="List of professional wrestling terms">worked</a>. Referring to events or interviews as being a "work" means that the event/interview has been "kayfabed" or staged, and/or is part of a wrestling <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#A" title="List of professional wrestling terms">angle</a> while being passed off as legitimate. In relative terms, a wrestler breaking kayfabe during a show would be likened to an <a href="/wiki/Actor" title="Actor">actor</a> <a href="/wiki/Breaking_character" title="Breaking character">breaking character</a> on camera. The origin of the term is uncertain. The term is thought to have been adopted from <a href="/wiki/Carny" title="Carny">carny</a> slang.<sup id="cite_ref-about.com_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-about.com-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Kayfabe is often seen as the <a href="/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief" title="Suspension of disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a> that is used to create the non-wrestling aspects of promotions, such as <a href="/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)" title="Feud (professional wrestling)">feuds</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#A" title="List of professional wrestling terms">angles</a>, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_professional_wrestling_terms#G" title="List of professional wrestling terms">gimmicks</a>, in a similar manner with other forms of entertainment such as <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> or <a href="/wiki/Film" title="Film">film</a>. In the past, virtually all wrestlers adhered to kayfabe in public, even when outside the ring and off-camera, in order to preserve the illusion that the competition in pro wrestling was not staged. With the advent of the Internet Wrestling Community and, most importantly, the <a href="/wiki/Sports_entertainment" title="Sports entertainment">sports entertainment</a> movement, pro wrestling has become less concerned with protecting so-called backstage secrets and typically maintains kayfabe only during performances. However, kayfabe is occasionally broken, including during performances, in order to achieve a number of goals, among them advancing the storylines, explaining prolonged absences (often due to legitimate injury), paying tribute to other wrestlers and sometimes for comedic effect or that of driving insider humor.</p>

<p>The characters assumed by wrestlers can be distinguished into <a href="/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)" title="Face (professional wrestling)">faces</a> and <a href="/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">heels</a>. Faces, short for babyfaces, are <a href="/wiki/Hero" title="Hero">heroic</a>-type characters whose personalities are crafted to elicit the support of the audience through traits such as <a href="/wiki/Humility" title="Humility">humbleness</a>, a hard working nature, <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sticktoitiveness" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:sticktoitiveness">sticktoitiveness</a> and reciprocal love of the crowd. Faces usually win matches on the basis of their technical skills and are sometimes portrayed as <a href="/wiki/Underdogs" title="Underdogs">underdogs</a> to enhance the story. Heels are <a href="/wiki/Antagonist_(literature)" title="Antagonist (literature)" class="mw-redirect">antagonist</a>-type characters, <a href="/wiki/Villain" title="Villain">villains</a> if you will, whose personalities are crafted to elicit a negative response from the audience. They often embrace traditionally negative traits such as <a href="/wiki/Narcissism" title="Narcissism">narcissism</a>/<a href="/wiki/Egomania" title="Egomania" class="mw-redirect">egomania</a>, unprompted rage, <a href="/wiki/Sadism" title="Sadism">sadism</a> and general bitterness. Heels typically inspire <a href="/wiki/Booing" title="Booing">boos</a> from the audience and often employ underhanded tactics, such as cheating and exploiting technicalities, in their fighting strategies. Matches are usually organized between a heel and a face, and the distinction between the two types may be blurred as a given character's storyline reaches a peak or becomes more complicated.</p>

<p>Many storylines make use of kayfabe romantic relationships between two performers. Very often, both participants have other real-life relationships, and the "relationship" between the two is simply a storyline. However, more than once, kayfabe romantic relationships have resulted either from a real-life relationship, such as between <a href="/wiki/Matt_Hardy" title="Matt Hardy">Matt Hardy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amy_Dumas" title="Amy Dumas">Lita</a>, or ultimately developed into a real-life marriage (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Triple_H" title="Triple H">Triple H</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stephanie_McMahon" title="Stephanie McMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>, who married in 2003, more than a year after their kayfabe marriage ended).<sup id="cite_ref-sun_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sun-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>For years, the <a href="/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">World Wrestling Federation</a> presented real-life spouses <a href="/wiki/Randy_Savage" title="Randy Savage">"Macho Man" Randy Savage</a> and <a href="/wiki/Miss_Elizabeth" title="Miss Elizabeth">Miss Elizabeth</a> as a wrestler-<a href="/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)" title="Manager (professional wrestling)">manager</a> relationship, with no mention that they were actually married. In 1991, the two began a kayfabe romantic relationship, which culminated in a wedding ceremony at that August's <i><a href="/wiki/SummerSlam_(1991)" title="SummerSlam (1991)">SummerSlam 1991</a></i>. The storyline ended a year later with the couple's real-life divorce and Miss Elizabeth's departure from the WWF.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Tag_team" title="Tag team">Tag teams</a> of wrestlers, who may or may not look alike, are often presented as relatives, though they are not actually related. Examples include <a href="/wiki/The_Undertaker" title="The Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Jacobs" title="Glenn Jacobs">Kane</a>, the <a href="/wiki/The_Holly_Cousins" title="The Holly Cousins">The Holly Cousins</a> (<a href="/wiki/Bob_Holly" title="Bob Holly">Hardcore Holly</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mike_Lockwood" title="Mike Lockwood">Crash Holly</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Nora_Greenwald" title="Nora Greenwald">Molly Holly</a>), the <a href="/wiki/Dudley_family" title="Dudley family">Dudley family</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <a href="/wiki/Von_Erich_family" title="Von Erich family">Von Erichs</a>, despite being a real life family, had a number of peripheral kayfabe relatives, most notably <a href="/wiki/Waldo_Von_Erich" title="Waldo Von Erich">Waldo</a> and his "son", <a href="/wiki/Lance_Von_Erich" title="Lance Von Erich">Lance</a>. Additionally, the "Von Erich" name itself was kayfabed; their real family name was Adkisson.</p>
<p><a name=".22You.27re_fired.21.22_and_.22I_quit.21.22" id=".22You.27re_fired.21.22_and_.22I_quit.21.22"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Kayfabe&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: &quot;You're fired!&quot; and &quot;I quit!&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"You're fired!" and "I quit!"</span></h3>
<p>Through kayfabe, wrestlers often quit or get fired, or are said to have been booked to lose a match where their jobs are on the line (e.g., a "<a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types#Loser_Leaves_Town_match" title="Professional wrestling match types">loser leaves town match</a>"), only to return at a future time.</p>
<p>However, such "departures" may also be used to advance a feud between two wrestlers. A classic example is the "masked man," where the wrestler (usually a face) who has supposedly lost his job makes appearances at subsequent events while wearing a mask, and then interferes in his heel opponent's matches; eventually, the masked wrestler's identity is exposed by his foe and the feud intensifies. This storyline was used for the <a href="/wiki/Dusty_Rhodes_(wrestler)" title="Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)">Dusty Rhodes</a>/<a href="/wiki/Kevin_Sullivan_(wrestler)" title="Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)">Kevin Sullivan</a> feud during the 1980s and also for the feud between <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" title="Vince McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hulk_Hogan" title="Hulk Hogan">Hulk Hogan</a> in 2003. Some more recent examples include <a href="/wiki/Darren_Matthews" title="Darren Matthews">William Regal</a> losing a Loser Gets Fired match against <a href="/wiki/Mr._Kennedy" title="Mr. Kennedy">Mr. Kennedy</a> on the May 19 episode of <i>Raw</i> (Regal was actually suspended for sixty days due to violation of the <a href="/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment#Wellness_Program" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWE Wellness Policy</a>), <a href="/wiki/The_Undertaker" title="The Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> losing a <a href="/wiki/Tables,_Ladders,_and_Chairs_match" title="Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match">Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match</a> to <a href="/wiki/Adam_Copeland" title="Adam Copeland">Edge</a> at <a href="/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(2008)" title="One Night Stand (2008)">WWE One Night Stand</a> where the winner would get the vacant <a href="/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)" title="World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)">WWE World Heavyweight Championship</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shawn_Michaels" title="Shawn Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a>' eye being 'injured' and making the decision to retire from wrestling.</p>
<p>The "you're fired" gimmick has also successfully been used to repackage a wrestler with a new gimmick.</p>
<p>On the August 22, 2005 edition of <i><a href="/wiki/WWE_Raw" title="WWE Raw">Raw</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/WWE_Championship" title="WWE Championship">WWE Champion</a> <a href="/wiki/John_Cena" title="John Cena">John Cena</a> successfully defended his title by defeating <a href="/wiki/Chris_Jericho" title="Chris Jericho">Chris Jericho</a> in a "You're Fired!" match. <a href="/wiki/Eric_Bischoff" title="Eric Bischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> promptly fired Jericho, and ordered that he be taken from the arena by security. Jericho was not truly fired, however, as his release was a mutual arrangement. The match had been conceived to cover for Jericho's departure from the company, and he eventually returned to the WWE on the November 19, 2007 edition of <i>Raw</i> after an absence of just over two years.</p>
<p>On an episode of <i><a href="/wiki/TNA_Impact!" title="TNA Impact!">TNA Impact!</a></i> on December 6, <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Daniels" title="Christopher Daniels">Christopher Daniels</a> was fired in the Feast or Fired match and due to the stipulations it was revealed that Daniels' briefcase contained the pink slip, immediately causing him to be released from TNA. He reappeared on January 24 under the guise of Curry Man, a masked character he has used in <a href="/wiki/New_Japan_Pro_Wrestling" title="New Japan Pro Wrestling">New Japan Pro Wrestling</a>. He was then fired under this name in another Feast or Fired Match.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Kayfabe&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Breaking kayfabe">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Breaking kayfabe</span></h2>
<p>There have been several examples of breaking kayfabe throughout wrestling history. It should be pointed out that what exactly constitutes "breaking" is rather difficult to define. It is rare for kayfabe to be dispensed with totally and the events acknowledged as scripted. Often the "break" may be implied or through an allusion (for example calling a wrestler by his/her real name; which is done often) and standards tend to vary as to what is a break. In the <a href="/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWE</a> during and after the <a href="/wiki/World_Wrestling_Entertainment#Attitude_Era" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">Attitude Era</a> the line between kayfabe and reality was often blurred, while in the time prior to that such as in the Hulkamania era, kayfabe was usually strictly adhered to.</p>
<p>With the growth of the industry and its exposure on the <a href="/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a> and <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> and <a href="/wiki/Video" title="Video">videos</a>, kayfabe may be broken more regularly. Whereas in the past it was extremely rare for a wrestler or other involved person to recognize the scripted nature of events even in outside press or media, WWE DVDs and WWE.com routinely give news and acknowledge real life. In the case of the former, it has ostensible adversaries and allies talking about each other, and the angles and storylines they worked and their opinions on them. On WWE.com, real life news is often given which may contradict storylines.</p>
<p>As of late, WWE.com has included an "Industry News" section to their website, which regularly breaks kayfabe to deliver news about current and former WWE superstars, and even going beyond their former policy of not acknowledging their competition, <a href="/wiki/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling" title="Total Nonstop Action Wrestling">TNA</a>, by posting <i><a href="/wiki/TNA_Impact!" title="TNA Impact!">TNA Impact!</a></i> and pay per view results on their site. Live events for virtually every wrestling company around the world are also listed on a regular basis, as are tidbits regarding wrestlers, such as <a href="/wiki/Nick_Hogan" title="Nick Hogan">Nick Hogan</a>'s arrest and subsequent incarceration, the <a href="/wiki/Warrior_(wrestler)" title="Warrior (wrestler)">Ultimate Warrior</a>'s return to wrestling and challenging <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" title="Vince McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> to a match, etc.</p>
<p>Kayfabe has been broken many times, though it may not always be apparent to fans as seen below. The following is a list of some of the more notable examples.</p>
<p><a name="Montreal_Screwjob" id="Montreal_Screwjob"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Kayfabe&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Montreal Screwjob">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Montreal Screwjob</span></h3>
<p>The most popular example is the <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Screwjob" title="Montreal Screwjob">Montreal Screwjob</a> (also called the Montreal Incident) in which <a href="/wiki/Bret_Hart" title="Bret Hart">Bret Hart</a> (<a href="/wiki/WWE_Championship" title="WWE Championship">WWF Champion</a> at the time) was going to wrestle Shawn Michaels for the WWF Championship. The agreed finish was to have Hart walk away with the title that night and come on <i>Raw</i> the next night to give up the championship. Hart had already signed a deal with <a href="/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling" title="World Championship Wrestling">World Championship Wrestling</a> and still had three weeks after <a href="/wiki/Survivor_Series_(1997)" title="Survivor Series (1997)">Survivor Series 1997</a> before appearing on <i><a href="/wiki/WCW_Monday_Nitro" title="WCW Monday Nitro">WCW Monday Nitro</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" title="Vince McMahon">Vince McMahon</a>, fearing that his championship would appear on his rival's TV show, felt that he needed to change the agreed finish without telling Hart. Vince went out and told the ring crew to ring the bell and say Michaels won the championship. Hart, very upset, spat on Vince (later punching him in the dressing room) and wreaked havoc on equipment around the ring. It was long thought that Michaels had nothing to do with the change, but it was later found out he was in on it as well. The incident was <a href="/wiki/Montreal_Screwjob#Legacy" title="Montreal Screwjob">recreated</a> several times over the years such as in a storyline to screw <a href="/wiki/Mick_Foley" title="Mick Foley">Mankind</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Survivor_Series_(1998)" title="Survivor Series (1998)">following year's Survivor Series</a>.

<p>In a shoot interview with <a href="/wiki/Rob_Feinstein" title="Rob Feinstein">RFvideo.com</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Nash" title="Kevin Nash">Kevin Nash</a> expressed his suspicions of the legitimacy of the Montreal Screwjob. He believes the whole thing was a "work". He claims that it was too much of coincidence that all of the cameras were in the right place at the right time, during the Screwjob itself. He went on to say that Vince McMahon was staggering a little too much after being punched. He knew Vince as a man who would never sell a real punch as much as he did. He also claimed that if McMahon didn't want something videotaped it wouldn't be videotaped, relating to the video footage of the punch aftermath.</p>

Nash and Hall were on their way to rival promotion <a href="/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling" title="World Championship Wrestling">WCW</a>, and the incident was a farewell from Michaels and Triple H. As punishment for breaking kayfabe, Triple H was relegated to working lower card matches and was booked to lose to <a href="/wiki/Jake_Roberts" title="Jake Roberts">Jake "The Snake" Roberts</a> in the <a href="/wiki/King_of_the_Ring#1996" title="King of the Ring">King of the Ring 1996</a> tournament, having previously been booked to win it.

<p><a href="/wiki/Shoot_(professional_wrestling)" title="Shoot (professional wrestling)">Shoot</a> comments were a popular tactic of <a href="/wiki/Vince_Russo" title="Vince Russo">Vince Russo</a>, who would often blur the line between kayfabe and reality.

<p>Kayfabe and real life came into serious conflict on June 25, 2007, when the actual death of <a href="/wiki/Chris_Benoit" title="Chris Benoit">Chris Benoit</a> necessitated an appearance by WWE chairman <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" title="Vince McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> on his <i><a href="/wiki/WWE_Raw" title="WWE Raw">WWE Raw</a></i> program which aired that same day, even though the character of <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon#Mr._McMahon" title="Vince McMahon">Mr. McMahon</a> had been "killed" in an automobile explosion on a previous episode.

<p>In the ring as in theater many scripted things can easily go wrong, either due to wrestler or equipment error. Like theater, these are often covered-up and not apparent to fans. On some occasions mishaps have been brought into sharp relief due to the circumstances or actions of individuals, making the mistakes obvious.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/SummerSlam_(1995)" title="SummerSlam (1995)">1995 Summerslam</a> <a href="/wiki/Ladder_match" title="Ladder match">ladder match</a> for the <a href="/wiki/WWE_Intercontinental_Championship" title="WWE Intercontinental Championship">Intercontinental Championship</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shawn_Michaels" title="Shawn Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a> twice fumbled in his attempt to retrieve the belt, the second time very obviously, forcing his opponent <a href="/wiki/Scott_Hall" title="Scott Hall">Razor Ramon</a> to lie down for a lengthy period of time, far greater than what is normally associated with the <a href="/wiki/Bump_(professional_wrestling)" title="Bump (professional wrestling)">bump</a> that he took.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At <a href="/wiki/SummerSlam_(1997)" title="SummerSlam (1997)">SummerSlam 1997</a>, in another Intercontinental Title Match, a <a href="/wiki/Piledriver_(professional_wrestling)#Reverse_piledriver" title="Piledriver (professional wrestling)">reverse piledriver</a> administered by <a href="/wiki/Owen_Hart" title="Owen Hart">Owen Hart</a> to <a href="/wiki/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin" title="Stone Cold Steve Austin">Steve Austin</a> resulted in a serious injury for Austin. He was clearly unable to move for several minutes and eventually only did so with great difficulty. Owen Hart's concern was apparent to all. Austin was scripted to win, and Owen taunted him and the crowd for a while until Austin rolled him up for a weak pin and the win.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At <a href="/wiki/SummerSlam_(2000)" title="SummerSlam (2000)">SummerSlam 2000</a>, in the 3-way match for the WWF Championship (between The Rock, Triple H &amp; Kurt Angle) in the early stages of the match when attempting to give Kurt Angle a Pedigree on top of the announcers table, the table gave way and both Triple H and Kurt Angle collapsed, with Angle face first hitting the floor he became unconscious, soon The Rock came out and he and Triple H for the foreseeable time improvised.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In October 2007, <a href="/wiki/John_Cena" title="John Cena">John Cena</a> battled <a href="/wiki/Mr._Kennedy" title="Mr. Kennedy">Mr. Kennedy</a> on an edition of <i>Raw</i>. During the match, Cena injured his shoulder while executing a <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_throws#Hip_toss" title="Professional wrestling throws">hip toss</a> on Kennedy. For the duration of the match, Cena visibly favored his shoulder and arm. After the match, <a href="/wiki/Randy_Orton" title="Randy Orton">Randy Orton</a> (then in the middle of a feud with Cena), attacked Cena, eventually performing his finisher (the <a href="/wiki/Cutter_(professional_wrestling)#Jumping_cutter" title="Cutter (professional wrestling)">RKO</a>) on him while on top of an announcing table. WWE worked Cena's real life injury into the Randy Orton/John Cena feud storyline, stating that Cena's shoulder was injured due to the RKO (and not that it was injured during the match with Mr. Kennedy).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Candice_Michelle" title="Candice Michelle">Candice Michelle</a> battled <a href="/wiki/Beth_Phoenix" title="Beth Phoenix">Beth Phoenix</a> for the <a href="/wiki/WWE_Women%27s_Championship" title="WWE Women's Championship">WWE Women's Championship</a> in a <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types#Two_out_of_Three_Falls_match" title="Professional wrestling match types">Two out of Three falls</a>.

It was later reported that she had legitimately broken her collarbone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In June 2008, at the <a href="/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(2008)" title="One Night Stand (2008)">One Night Stand</a> PPV, <a href="/wiki/Triple_H" title="Triple H">Triple H</a> battled Randy Orton in a <a href="/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types#Last_Man_Standing_match" title="Professional wrestling match types">Last Man Standing match</a> for the <a href="/wiki/WWE_Championship" title="WWE Championship">WWE Championship</a>. At one point during the match, Orton was supposed to attempt an RKO on Triple H, which was then supposed to be countered, resulting in Orton being thrown over the top rope to the floor. Yet as Orton hit the floor, he suffered a legitimate broken collarbone, and as he was writhing in agony, Triple H could be seen discussing with the referee and the EMTs whether or not to continue the match; it was obviously decided to conclude the match early, so Triple H took out his signature <a href="/wiki/Sledgehammer" title="Sledgehammer">sledgehammer</a>, and proceeded to hit Orton in the head with it, thus finishing the match.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Bret_Hart" title="Bret Hart">Bret Hart</a> once talked about a match against <a href="/wiki/Dino_Bravo" title="Dino Bravo">Dino Bravo</a> he was meant to win; during the match, Bravo threw Hart into a barrier outside of the ring and broke Hart's sternum. Without letting Bravo know, Hart battled on and was in severe pain. When he was thrown back into the ring, he rolled himself back outside the ring and was counted out without giving away his injury.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On February 25, 2001 at No Way Out, the Rock wrestled WWF Champion Kurt Angle. As noted in Angle's autobiography It's True! It's True! the finish to the match was supposed to be the Rock giving Angle a Rock Bottom to win the match and the title. He did so, but referee <a href="/wiki/Earl_Hebner" title="Earl Hebner">Earl Hebner</a> stopped his count at two by mistake by almost counting three but stopping short, apparently forgetting the original finish. Jim Ross and Tazz covered for Hebner's mistake by saying that Angle had kicked out despite the fact that Angle made no visible effort to do so. The Rock then gave Angle a second Rock Bottom and Hebner made a three count to finally end the match.</li>

<p>On the May 5, 2008 edition of <i>WWE Raw</i>, <a href="/wiki/Roddy_Piper" title="Roddy Piper">Roddy Piper</a> mentioned <a href="/wiki/Santino_Marella" title="Santino Marella">Santino Marella</a>'s recent DUI arrest on Carlito's Cabana.</p>
<p>Certain storylines can also be ended due to a kayfabe event. One example of this happening was on the June 23, 2008 episode of WWE Raw when <a href="/wiki/Vince_McMahon" title="Vince McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> finished giving away $1,000,000 as part of his Million Dollar Mania. After giving away $500,000, the left hand part of the stage collapsed and Vince tumbled to the ground. After he got up, a monitor fell on him, which resulted in all of the Superstars that were in the ring and several people from backstage running in to help him, which made it feel like it was legit. Vince also was heard referring to Triple H by his real name (Paul).</p>

<p>Some efforts to promote kayfabe have resulted in real-life consequences.</p>
<p>While working as a booker for WCW, <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Sullivan" title="Kevin Sullivan">Kevin Sullivan</a> conceived an angle where Woman (<a href="/wiki/Nancy_Benoit" title="Nancy Benoit">Nancy Daus Sullivan</a>, Sullivan's wife both on-screen and off), would leave his character for <a href="/wiki/Chris_Benoit" title="Chris Benoit">Chris Benoit</a>'s. Sullivan insisted that the two should travel together to preserve kayfabe for the general public. This resulted in Sullivan's wife legitimately leaving him for Benoit when the two developed a real-life romantic relationship during their time together. Nancy ultimately married Benoit in 2000 and they remained married until the <a href="/wiki/Chris_Benoit_double_murder_and_suicide" title="Chris Benoit double murder and suicide">publicized double-murder-suicide</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Brian_Pillman" title="Brian Pillman">Brian Pillman</a> developed the "Loose Cannon" persona for himself while in WCW in 1996, conspiring with Vice President <a href="/wiki/Eric_Bischoff" title="Eric Bischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> and booker Kevin Sullivan. Pillman's gimmick was based entirely on straddling the fine line of kayfabe. He would engage in on-camera actions that seemed to be unscripted, even to the other performers, and even breached kayfabe protocol when he addressed Sullivan on air as "bookerman". In the ultimate act of turning fiction into fact, Pillman convinced Sullivan and Bischoff that their storyline "firing" of him would seem more legitimate with the physical evidence of a release form. They faxed an actual WCW contract termination notice to him, complete with his name and the proper signatures, in order to preserve kayfabe.</p>

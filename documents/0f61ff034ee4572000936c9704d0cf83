<p><b>Thomas Jonathan</b> "<b>Stonewall</b>" <b>Jackson</b> (January 21, 1824<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> – May 10, 1863) was a <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_Army" title="Confederate States Army">Confederate</a> general during the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, and probably the most well-known Confederate commander after General <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> His <a href="/wiki/Military_career_of_Stonewall_Jackson" title="Military career of Stonewall Jackson">military career</a> includes the <a href="/wiki/Valley_Campaign" title="Valley Campaign">Valley Campaign</a> of 1862 and his service as a corps commander in the <a href="/wiki/Army_of_Northern_Virginia" title="Army of Northern Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> under Robert E.

Confederate <a href="/wiki/Picket_(military)" title="Picket (military)">pickets</a> accidentally shot him at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville" title="Battle of Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a> on May 2, 1863, which the general survived, albeit with the loss of an arm to amputation. However, he died of complications of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> eight days later. His death was a severe setback for the Confederacy, affecting not only its military prospects, but also the morale of its army and of the general public.</p>
<p>Military historians consider Jackson to be one of the most gifted tactical commanders in <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_United_States" title="History of the United States">United States history</a>. His Valley Campaign and his envelopment of the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union Army</a> right wing at Chancellorsville are studied worldwide even today as examples of innovative and bold leadership.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Paternal ancestry</span></h3>
<p>Thomas Jonathan Jackson was the great-grandson of John Jackson (1715 or 1719 – 1801) and Elizabeth <a href="/wiki/Clan_Cumming" title="Clan Cumming">Cummins</a> (also known as Elizabeth Comings and Elizabeth Needles) (1723 – 1828). John Jackson was born a Protestant in <a href="/wiki/Coleraine" title="Coleraine">Coleraine</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_Londonderry" title="County Londonderry">County Londonderry</a>, in Northern Ireland. While living in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, he was convicted of the capital crime of larceny for stealing £170; the judge at the <a href="/wiki/Old_Bailey" title="Old Bailey">Old Bailey</a> sentenced him to a seven-year <a href="/wiki/Indenture" title="Indenture">indenture</a> in America. Elizabeth, a strong, blonde woman over 6&#160;feet (1.8&#160;m) tall, born in London, was also convicted of larceny in an unrelated case for stealing 19 pieces of silver, jewelry, and fine lace, and received a similar sentence. They both were transported on the prison ship <i>Litchfield</i>, which departed London in May 1749 with 150 convicts. John and Elizabeth met on board and were in love by the time the ship arrived at <a href="/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland" title="Annapolis, Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>. Although they were sent to different locations in Maryland for their indentures, the couple married in July 1755.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The family migrated west across the <a href="/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Mountains" title="Blue Ridge Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> to settle near <a href="/wiki/Moorefield,_West_Virginia" title="Moorefield, West Virginia">Moorefield, Virginia</a>, (now <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>) in 1758. In 1770, they moved further west to the <a href="/wiki/Tygart_Valley_River" title="Tygart Valley River">Tygart Valley</a>. They began to acquire large parcels of virgin farmland near the present-day town of <a href="/wiki/Buckhannon,_West_Virginia" title="Buckhannon, West Virginia">Buckhannon</a>, including 3,000 acres (12&#160;km²) in Elizabeth's name. John and his two teenage sons were early recruits for the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, fighting in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Kings_Mountain" title="Battle of Kings Mountain">Battle of Kings Mountain</a> on October 7, 1780; John finished the war as <a href="/wiki/Captain_(OF-2)" title="Captain (OF-2)" class="mw-redirect">captain</a> and served as a <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant" title="Lieutenant">lieutenant</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Militia" title="Virginia Militia" class="mw-redirect">Virginia Militia</a> after 1787. While the men were in the Army, Elizabeth converted their home to a haven, "Jackson's Fort," for refugees from <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">Indian</a> attacks.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>John and Elizabeth had eight children. Their second son was Edward Jackson (March 1, 1759 – December 25, 1828), and Edward's third son was Jonathan Jackson, Thomas's father.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Early_childhood" id="Early_childhood"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Early childhood</span></h3>
<p>Thomas Jackson was the third child of <a href="/wiki/Julia_Neale_Jackson" title="Julia Neale Jackson">Julia Beckwith (née Neale) Jackson</a> (1798 – 1831) and Jonathan Jackson (1790 – 1826), an <a href="/wiki/Lawyer" title="Lawyer">attorney</a>. Both of Jackson's parents were natives of Virginia. The family already had two young children and were living in <a href="/wiki/Clarksburg,_West_Virginia" title="Clarksburg, West Virginia">Clarksburg</a>, in what is now West Virginia. This is where their third child, Thomas, was born. He was named for his maternal grandfather.</p>
<p>Thomas's sister Elizabeth (age six) died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> on March 6, 1826, while two-year-old Thomas sat by her bedside. His father died of the same disease March 26. Jackson's mother gave birth to Thomas's sister Laura Ann the day after Jackson's father died.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Julia Jackson thus was widowed at 28 and was left with much debt and three young children (including the newborn). She sold the family's possessions to pay the debts. She declined family charity and moved into a small rented one-room house.

<p>As their mother's health continued to fail, Jackson and his sister Laura Ann were sent to live with their uncle, <a href="/wiki/Cummins_Jackson" title="Cummins Jackson">Cummins Jackson</a>, who owned a grist mill in <a href="/wiki/Jackson%27s_Mill" title="Jackson's Mill">Jackson's Mill</a> (near present-day <a href="/wiki/Weston,_West_Virginia" title="Weston, West Virginia">Weston</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lewis_County,_West_Virginia" title="Lewis County, West Virginia">Lewis County</a> in central <a href="/wiki/West_Virginia" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>). Their older brother, Warren, went to live with other relatives on his mother's side of the family, but he later died of <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1841 at the age of 20. Thomas and Laura Ann returned from Jackson's Mill in November 1831 to be at their dying mother's bedside. They spent four years together at the Mill before being separated—Laura Ann was sent to live with her mother's family, Thomas to live with his Aunt Polly (his father's sister) and her husband, Isaac Brake, on a farm 4 miles from Clarksburg. Thomas was treated by Brake as an outsider and, having suffered verbal abuse for over a year, ran away from the family. When his cousin in Clarksburg beseeched him to return to Aunt Polly's, he replied, "Maybe I ought to, ma'am, but I am not going to." He walked 18 miles through mountain wilderness to Jackson's Mill, where he was welcomed by his uncles and he remained there for the following seven years.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Cummins Jackson was strict with Thomas, who looked up to Cummins as a <a href="/wiki/Teacher" title="Teacher">schoolteacher</a>. Jackson helped around the farm, tending sheep with the assistance of a <a href="/wiki/Sheepdog" title="Sheepdog" class="mw-redirect">sheepdog</a>, driving teams of <a href="/wiki/Oxen" title="Oxen" class="mw-redirect">oxen</a> and helping harvest wheat and corn. Formal education was not easily obtained, but he attended school when and where he could. Much of Jackson's education was self-taught. He once made a deal with one of his uncle's <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slaves</a> to provide him with pine knots in exchange for reading lessons; Thomas would stay up at night reading borrowed books by the light of those burning pine knots. Virginia law forbade teaching a slave, free black or mulatto to read or write, as enacted following <a href="/wiki/Nat_Turner%27s_slave_rebellion" title="Nat Turner's slave rebellion">Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion</a> in <a href="/wiki/Southampton_County,_Virginia" title="Southampton County, Virginia">Southampton County</a> in 1831.

<p>In 1842, Jackson was accepted to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy" title="United States Military Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="/wiki/West_Point,_New_York" title="West Point, New York">West Point</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>. Because of his inadequate schooling, he had difficulty with the entrance examinations and began his studies at the bottom of his class. As a student, he had to work harder than most cadets to absorb lessons. However, displaying a dogged determination that was to characterize his life, he became one of the hardest working cadets in the academy, and moved steadily up the academic rankings. Jackson graduated 17th out of 59 students in the Class of 1846. It was said by his peers that if he had stayed there another year, he would have graduated first.</p>

<p>Jackson began his <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> career as a <a href="/wiki/Brevet_(military)" title="Brevet (military)">brevet</a> <a href="/wiki/Second_Lieutenant#United_States" title="Second Lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment and was sent to fight in the <a href="/wiki/Mexican-American_War" title="Mexican-American War" class="mw-redirect">Mexican-American War</a> from 1846 to 1848. He served at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Veracruz" title="Siege of Veracruz">Siege of Veracruz</a> and the battles of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Contreras" title="Battle of Contreras">Contreras</a>, <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chapultepec" title="Battle of Chapultepec">Chapultepec</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Battle_for_Mexico_City" title="Battle for Mexico City">Mexico City</a>, eventually earning two brevet promotions, and the <a href="/wiki/Regular_Army_(United_States)" title="Regular Army (United States)">regular army</a> rank of <a href="/wiki/First_Lieutenant#United_States" title="First Lieutenant">first lieutenant</a>. It was in Mexico that Jackson first met <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>.</p>
<p>During the assault on Chapultepec Castle, he refused what he felt was a "bad order" to withdraw his troops. Confronted by his superior, he explained his rationale, claiming withdrawal was more hazardous than continuing his overmatched artillery duel. His judgment proved correct, and a relieving brigade was able to exploit the advantage Jackson had broached. In contrast to this display of strength of character, he obeyed what he also felt was a "bad order" when he raked a civilian throng with artillery fire after the Mexican authorities failed to surrender Mexico City at the hour demanded by the U.S. forces.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The former episode, and later aggressive action against the retreating Mexican army, earned him field promotion to the brevet rank of major.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Lexington and the Virginia Military Institute</span></h3>
<p>In the spring of 1851,<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Jackson accepted a newly created teaching position at the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Military_Institute" title="Virginia Military Institute">Virginia Military Institute</a> (VMI), in <a href="/wiki/Lexington,_Virginia" title="Lexington, Virginia">Lexington, Virginia</a>. He became Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy and Instructor of Artillery. Jackson's teachings are still used at VMI today because they are military essentials that are timeless, to wit: discipline, mobility, assessing the enemy's strength and intentions while attempting to conceal your own, and the efficiency of <a href="/wiki/Artillery" title="Artillery">artillery</a> combined with an <a href="/wiki/Infantry" title="Infantry">infantry</a> assault.</p>
<p>However, despite the high quality of his work, he was not popular as a teacher. He memorized his lectures and then recited them to the class; any students who came to ask for help were only given the same explanation as before. And if students came to ask again, Jackson viewed this as insubordination and likewise punished them. The students mocked his apparently stern, religious nature and his eccentric traits. In 1856, a group of alumni attempted to have Jackson removed from his position.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Little as he was known to the white inhabitants of Lexington, Jackson was revered by many of the <a href="/wiki/African-American" title="African-American" class="mw-redirect">African-Americans</a> in town, both slaves and free blacks. He was instrumental in the organization in 1855 of Sunday school classes for blacks at the Presbyterian Church. His second wife, Mary Anna Jackson, taught with Jackson, as "he preferred that my labors should be given to the colored children, believing that it was more important and useful to put the strong hand of the Gospel under the ignorant African race, to lift them up." <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The pastor, Dr. William Spottswood White, described the relationship between Jackson and his Sunday afternoon students: "In their religious instruction he succeeded wonderfully. His discipline was systematic and firm, but very kind. ... His servants reverenced and loved him, as they would have done a brother or father. ... He was emphatically the black man's friend." He addressed his students by name and they in turn referred to him affectionately as "Marse Major."<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Jackson's family owned six slaves in the late 1850s. Three (Hetty, Cyrus, and George, a mother and two teenage sons) were received as a wedding present. Another, Albert, requested that Jackson purchase him and allow him to work for his freedom; he was employed as a waiter in one of the Lexington hotels and Jackson rented him to VMI. Amy also requested that Jackson purchase her from a public auction and she served the family as a cook and housekeeper. The sixth, Emma, was a four-year-old orphan with a <a href="/wiki/Learning_disability" title="Learning disability">learning disability</a>, accepted by Jackson from an aged widow and presented to his second wife, Mary Anna, as a welcome-home gift.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> After the American Civil War began, he appears to have hired out or sold his slaves. Mary Anna Jackson, in her 1895 memoir, said, "our servants ... without the firm guidance and restraint of their master, the excitement of the times proved so demoralizing to them that he deemed it best for me to provide them with good homes among the permanent residents." <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> James Robertson wrote about Jackson's view on slavery:<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div>
<p>Jackson neither apologized for nor spoke in favor of the practice of slavery. He probably opposed the institution. Yet in his mind the Creator had sanctioned slavery, and man had no moral right to challenge its existence. The good Christian slaveholder was one who treated his servants fairly and humanely at all times.</p>

<p>While an instructor at VMI, in 1853, Thomas Jackson married Elinor "Ellie" Junkin, whose father was president of Washington College (later named <a href="/wiki/Washington_and_Lee_University" title="Washington and Lee University">Washington and Lee University</a>) in Lexington. An addition was built onto the president's residence for the Jacksons, and when Robert E. Lee became president of Washington College he lived in the same home, now known as the Lee-Jackson House.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Ellie gave birth to a stillborn son on October 22, 1854, experiencing a hemorrhage an hour later that proved fatal.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After a tour of Europe, Jackson married again, in 1857. Mary Anna Morrison was from North Carolina, where her father was the first president of <a href="/wiki/Davidson_College" title="Davidson College">Davidson College</a>. They had a daughter named Mary Graham on April 30, 1858, but the baby died less than a month later. Another daughter was born in 1862, shortly before her father's death. The Jacksons named her <a href="/w/index.php?title=Julia_L._Jackson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Julia L. Jackson (page does not exist)">Julia Laura</a>, after his mother and sister.</p>
<p>Jackson purchased the only house he ever owned while in Lexington. Built in 1801, the brick town house at 8 East Washington Street was purchased by Jackson in 1859. He lived in it for two years before being called to serve in the Confederacy. Jackson never returned to his home.</p>
<p>In November 1859, at the request of the <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia" title="Governor of Virginia">governor of Virginia</a>, Major <a href="/wiki/William_Gilham" title="William Gilham">William Gilham</a> led a contingent of the VMI Cadet Corps to <a href="/wiki/Charles_Town,_West_Virginia" title="Charles Town, West Virginia">Charles Town</a> to provide an additional military presence at the execution by hanging on December 2, 1859, of militant abolitionist <a href="/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)" title="John Brown (abolitionist)">John Brown</a> following his raid on the federal arsenal at <a href="/wiki/Harpers_Ferry,_West_Virginia" title="Harpers Ferry, West Virginia">Harpers Ferry</a>.

Following the <a href="/wiki/Great_Train_Raid_of_1861" title="Great Train Raid of 1861" class="mw-redirect">Great Train Raid of 1861</a> he was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_general_(United_States)" title="Brigadier general (United States)">brigadier general</a> on June 17.<sup id="cite_ref-Eicher_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Eicher-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Jackson rose to prominence and earned his most famous nickname at the <a href="/wiki/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run" title="First Battle of Bull Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a> (First Manassas) in July 1861. As the Confederate lines began to crumble under heavy Union assault, Jackson's brigade provided crucial reinforcements on Henry House Hill, demonstrating the discipline he instilled in his men. Brig. Gen. <a href="/wiki/Barnard_Elliott_Bee,_Jr." title="Barnard Elliott Bee, Jr.">Barnard Elliott Bee, Jr.</a>, exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, "There is Jackson standing like a stone wall.

Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General <a href="/wiki/Joseph_E._Johnston" title="Joseph E. Johnston">Joseph E.

Gen. <a href="/wiki/Irvin_McDowell" title="Irvin McDowell">Irvin McDowell</a>'s large corps were poised to hit Richmond from the north, and Maj. Gen. <a href="/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Banks" title="Nathaniel P. Banks" class="mw-redirect">Nathaniel P. Banks</a>'s army threatened the Shenandoah Valley. Jackson was ordered by Richmond to operate in the Valley to defeat Banks' threat and prevent McDowell's troops from reinforcing McClellan.</p>
<p>Jackson possessed the attributes to succeed against his poorly coordinated and sometimes timid opponents: a combination of great audacity, excellent knowledge and shrewd use of the terrain, and the ability to inspire his troops to great feats of marching and fighting.</p>
<p>The campaign started with a tactical defeat at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Kernstown_I" title="Battle of Kernstown I" class="mw-redirect">Kernstown</a> on March 23, 1862, when faulty intelligence led him to believe he was attacking a much smaller force than was actually present, but it was a strategic victory for the Confederacy, forcing <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> to keep Banks' forces in the Valley and McDowell's 30,000-man <a href="/wiki/Corps" title="Corps">corps</a> near <a href="/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Virginia" title="Fredericksburg, Virginia">Fredericksburg</a>, subtracting about 50,000 soldiers from McClellan's invasion force.

He was still significantly outnumbered, but attacked portions of his divided enemy individually at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_McDowell" title="Battle of McDowell">McDowell</a>, defeating both <a href="/wiki/Brigadier_general_(United_States)" title="Brigadier general (United States)">Brig.

Lincoln decided that the defeat of Jackson was an immediate priority (though Jackson's orders were solely to keep Union forces occupied away from Richmond). They ordered Irvin McDowell to send 20,000 men to Front Royal and Maj. Gen. <a href="/wiki/John_C._Fr%C3%A9mont" title="John C. Frémont">John C. Frémont</a> to move to <a href="/wiki/Harrisonburg,_Virginia" title="Harrisonburg, Virginia">Harrisonburg</a>.

Union forces were withdrawn from the Valley.</p>
<p>It was a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver. Jackson pressed his army to travel 646&#160;miles (1,040&#160;km) in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17,000 against a combined force of 60,000. Stonewall Jackson's reputation for moving his troops so rapidly earned them the <a href="/wiki/Oxymoron" title="Oxymoron">oxymoronic</a> nickname "<a href="/wiki/Foot_cavalry" title="Foot cavalry">foot cavalry</a>".

Reports had last placed Jackson's forces in the Shenandoah Valley; their presence near Richmond added greatly to the Union commander's overestimation of the strength and numbers of the forces before him. This proved a crucial factor in McClellan's decision to re-establish his base at a point many miles downstream from Richmond on the <a href="/wiki/James_River_(Virginia)" title="James River (Virginia)">James River</a> at Harrison's Landing, essentially a retreat that ended the Peninsula Campaign and prolonged the war almost three more years.</p>
<p>Jackson's troops served well under Lee in the series of battles known as the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Days_Battles" title="Seven Days Battles">Seven Days Battles</a>, but Jackson's own performance in those battles is generally considered to be poor.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> He arrived late at Mechanicsville and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night within clear earshot of the battle. He was late and disoriented at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gaines%27_Mill" title="Battle of Gaines' Mill">Gaines' Mill</a>. He was late again at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Savage%27s_Station" title="Battle of Savage's Station">Savage's Station</a>, and at <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_White_Oak_Swamp" title="Battle of White Oak Swamp">White Oak Swamp</a>, he failed to employ fording places to cross White Oak Swamp Creek, attempting for hours to rebuild a bridge, which limited his involvement to an ineffectual artillery duel and a missed opportunity. At <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Malvern_Hill" title="Battle of Malvern Hill">Malvern Hill</a>, Jackson participated in the futile, piecemeal frontal assaults against entrenched Union infantry and massed artillery and suffered heavy casualties, but this was a problem for all of Lee's army in that ill-considered battle. The reasons for Jackson's sluggish and poorly coordinated actions during the Seven Days are disputed, although a severe lack of sleep after the grueling march and railroad trip from the Shenandoah Valley was probably a significant factor. Both Jackson and his troops were completely exhausted.</p>

<p>The military reputations of Lee's corps commanders are often characterized as Stonewall Jackson representing the audacious, offensive component of Lee's army, whereas his counterpart, <a href="/wiki/James_Longstreet" title="James Longstreet">James Longstreet</a>, more typically advocated and executed defensive strategies and tactics. Jackson has been described as the army's hammer, Longstreet its anvil.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Virginia_Campaign" title="Northern Virginia Campaign">Northern Virginia Campaign</a> of August 1862, this stereotype did not hold true. Longstreet commanded the Right Wing (later to become known as the First Corps) and Jackson commanded the Left Wing. Jackson started the campaign under Lee's orders with a sweeping flanking maneuver that placed his corps into the rear of Union Maj. Gen. <a href="/wiki/John_Pope_(military_officer)" title="John Pope (military officer)">John Pope</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Army_of_Virginia" title="Army of Virginia">Army of Virginia</a>, but he then took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him. On August 28–29, the start of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Bull_Run" title="Second Battle of Bull Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>, Pope launched repeated assaults against Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the Army marched north to reach the battlefield.</p>
<p>On August 30, Pope came to believe that Jackson was starting to retreat, and Longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the Union army's left with over 25,000 men. Although the Union troops put up a furious defense, Pope's army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing Union defeat at First Bull Run, fought on roughly the same battleground.</p>
<p>When Lee decided to invade the North in the <a href="/wiki/Maryland_Campaign" title="Maryland Campaign">Maryland Campaign</a>, Jackson took <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Harpers_Ferry" title="Battle of Harpers Ferry">Harpers Ferry</a>, then hastened to join the rest of the army at <a href="/wiki/Sharpsburg,_Maryland" title="Sharpsburg, Maryland">Sharpsburg, Maryland</a>, where they fought McClellan in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Antietam" title="Battle of Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>. Antietam was primarily a defensive battle fought against superior odds, although McClellan failed to exploit his advantage. Jackson's men bore the brunt of the initial attacks on the northern end of the battlefield and, at the end of the day, successfully resisted a breakthrough on the southern end when Jackson's subordinate, Maj. Gen. <a href="/wiki/A.P._Hill" title="A.P. Hill" class="mw-redirect">A.P. Hill</a>, arrived at the last minute from Harpers Ferry. The Confederate forces held their position, but the battle was extremely bloody for both sides, and Lee withdrew the <a href="/wiki/Army_of_Northern_Virginia" title="Army of Northern Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> back across the <a href="/wiki/Potomac_River" title="Potomac River">Potomac River</a>, ending the invasion. Jackson was promoted to <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_General_(CSA)" title="Lieutenant General (CSA)" class="mw-redirect">lieutenant general</a>. On October 10 his command was redesignated the Second Corps.</p>
<p>Before the armies camped for winter, Jackson's Second Corps held off a strong Union assault against the right flank of the Confederate line at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg" title="Battle of Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>, in what became a decisive Confederate victory. Just before the battle, Jackson was delighted to receive a letter about the birth of his daughter, Julia Laura Jackson, on November 23.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Also before the battle, Maj. Gen. <a href="/wiki/J.E.B._Stuart" title="J.E.B. Stuart">J.E.B. Stuart</a>, Lee's dashing and well-dressed cavalry commander, presented to Jackson a fine general's frock that he had ordered from one of the best tailors in Richmond. Jackson's previous coat was threadbare and colorless from exposure to the elements, its buttons removed by admiring ladies. Jackson asked his staff to thank Stuart, saying that although the coat was too handsome for him, he would cherish it as a souvenir. His staff insisted that he wear it to dinner, which caused scores of soldiers to rush to see him in uncharacteristic garb. So embarrassed was Jackson with the attention that he did not wear the new uniform for months.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Chancellorsville" id="Chancellorsville"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Chancellorsville</span></h3>
<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Chancellorsville" title="Battle of Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a>, the Army of Northern Virginia was faced with a serious threat by the Army of the Potomac and its new commanding general, Major General <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Hooker" title="Joseph Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>. General Lee decided to employ a risky tactic to take the initiative and offensive away from Hooker's new southern thrust—he decided to divide his forces. Jackson and his entire corps were sent on an aggressive flanking maneuver to the right of the Union lines. This flanking movement would be one of the most successful and dramatic of the war. While riding with his infantry in a wide berth well south and west of the Federal line of battle, Jackson employed Maj. Gen. <a href="/wiki/Fitzhugh_Lee" title="Fitzhugh Lee">Fitzhugh Lee</a>'s cavalry to provide for better reconnaissance in regards to the exact location of the Union right and rear. The results were far better than even Jackson could have hoped. Lee found the entire right side of the Federal lines in the middle of open field, guarded merely by two guns that faced westward, as well as the supplies and rear encampments. The men were eating and playing games in carefree fashion, completely unaware that an entire Confederate corps was less than a mile away. What happened next is given in Lee's own words:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>So impressed was I with my discovery, that I rode rapidly back to the point on the Plank road where I had left my cavalry, and back down the road Jackson was moving, until I met "Stonewall" himself. "General," said I, "if you will ride with me, halting your column here, out of sight, I will show you the enemy's right, and you will perceive the great advantage of attacking down the Old turnpike instead of the Plank road, the enemy's lines being taken in reverse. Bring only one courier, as you will be in view from the top of the hill." Jackson assented, and I rapidly conducted him to the point of observation. There had been no change in the picture. I only knew Jackson slightly. I watched him closely as he gazed upon Howard's troops. It was then about 2 P.M. His eyes burned with a brilliant glow, lighting up a sad face. His expression was one of intense interest, his face was colored slightly with the paint of approaching battle, and radiant at the success of his flank movement. To the remarks made to him while the unconscious line of blue was pointed out, he did not reply once during the five minutes he was on the hill, and yet his lips were moving. From what I have read and heard of Jackson since that day, I know now what he was doing then. Oh! "beware of rashness," General Hooker. Stonewall Jackson is praying in full view and in rear of your right flank! While talking to the Great God of Battles, how could he hear what a poor cavalryman was saying. "Tell General Rodes," said he, suddenly whirling his horse towards the courier, "to move across the Old plank road; halt when he gets to the Old turnpike, and I will join him there." One more look upon the Federal lines, and then he rode rapidly down the hill, his arms flapping to the motion of his horse, over whose head it seemed, good rider as he was, he would certainly go. I expected to be told I had made a valuable personal reconnaissance—saving the lives of many soldiers, and that Jackson was indebted to me to that amount at least. Perhaps I might have been a little chagrined at Jackson's silence, and hence commented inwardly and adversely upon his horsemanship. Alas! I had looked upon him for the last time.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">– <cite>Fitzhugh Lee, <i>address to the Association of the Army of Northern Virginia, 1879</i></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jackson immediately returned to his corps and arranged his divisions into a line of battle to charge directly into the oblivious Federal right. The Confederates marched silently until they were merely several hundred feet from the Union position, then released a bloodthirsty cry and full charge. Many of the Federals were captured without a shot fired, the rest were driven into a full rout. Jackson pursued relentlessly back toward the center of the Federal line until dusk.</p>

<p>Darkness ended the assault. As Jackson and his staff were returning to camp on May 2, they were mistaken for a Union cavalry force by a Confederate North Carolina regiment who shouted, "Halt, who goes there?," but fired before evaluating the reply. Jackson was hit by three bullets, two in the left arm and one in the right hand. Several other men in his staff were killed in addition to many horses. Darkness and confusion prevented Jackson from getting immediate care. He was dropped from his stretcher while being evacuated because of incoming artillery rounds. Because of his injuries, Jackson's left arm had to be <a href="/wiki/Amputated" title="Amputated" class="mw-redirect">amputated</a> by <a href="/wiki/Hunter_McGuire" title="Hunter McGuire">Dr. Hunter McGuire</a>. Jackson was moved to Thomas C. Chandler's 740&#160;acres (3.0&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) plantation named "Fairfield." He was offered Chandler's home for recovery, but Jackson refused and suggested using Chandler's plantation office building instead. He was thought to be out of harm's way, but unknown to the doctors, he already had classic symptoms of pneumonia, complaining of a sore chest. This soreness was mistakenly thought to be the result of his rough handling in the battlefield evacuation.</p>
<p><a name="Death" id="Death"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>Lee wrote to Jackson after learning of his injuries, stating "Could I have directed events, I would have chosen for the good of the country to be disabled in your stead."<sup id="cite_ref-ManSoldier_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ManSoldier-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> Jackson died of complications from pneumonia on May 10, 1863. On his death bed, though he became weaker, he remained spiritually strong. Jackson's words were "It is the Lord's Day; my wish is fulfilled. I have always desired to die on Sunday." Dr. McGuire wrote an account of his final hours and his last words:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>A few moments before he died he cried out in his delirium, "Order A.P. Hill to prepare for action! Pass the infantry to the front rapidly! Tell Major Hawks"—then stopped, leaving the sentence unfinished. Presently a smile of ineffable sweetness spread itself over his pale face, and he said quietly, and with an expression, as if of relief, "Let us cross over the river, and rest under the shade of the trees."<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His body was moved to the Governor's Mansion in Richmond for the public to mourn, and he was then moved to be buried in the Stonewall Jackson Memorial Cemetery, Lexington, Virginia. However, the arm that was amputated on May 2 was buried separately by Jackson's chaplain, at the J. Horace Lacy house, "Ellwood", in the Wilderness of <a href="/wiki/Orange_County,_Virginia" title="Orange County, Virginia">Orange County</a>, near the field hospital.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of Jackson's death, <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> mourned the loss of both a friend and a trusted commander. The night Lee learned of Jackson's death, he told his cook, "William, I have lost my right arm" (deliberately in contrast to Jackson's left arm) and "I'm bleeding at the heart." As Jackson lay dying, General <a href="/wiki/Robert_E._Lee" title="Robert E. Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> sent a message to Jackson through Chaplain Lacy, saying "Give General Jackson my affectionate regards, and say to him: he has lost his left arm but I my right."<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Jackson's sometimes-unusual command style and personality traits, combined with his frequent success in battle, contribute to his legacy as one of the most unique characters of the Civil War. Although martial in attitude, he was profoundly religious, a deacon in the <a href="/wiki/Presbyterianism" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian Church</a>. He disliked fighting on Sunday, although that did not stop him from doing so. He loved his wife very much and sent her tender letters. In direct contrast to Lee, Jackson was not a striking figure, often wearing old, worn-out clothes rather than a fancy uniform.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Physical ailments</span></h3>
<p>Jackson held a lifelong belief that one of his arms was longer than the other, and thus usually held the "longer" arm up to equalize his circulation. He was described as a "champion sleeper", even falling asleep with food in his mouth occasionally. He also became noted throughout the Confederate Army for leading his troops in complete circles. A paper delivered to the Society of Clinical Psychologists hypothesized that Jackson had <a href="/wiki/Asperger_syndrome" title="Asperger syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> Jackson also suffered a significant hearing loss in both of his ears as a result of his prior service in the U.S. Army as an artillery officer.</p>
<p>A recurring story concerns Jackson's love of lemons, which he allegedly gnawed whole to alleviate symptoms of <a href="/wiki/Dyspepsia" title="Dyspepsia">dyspepsia</a>. General <a href="/wiki/Richard_Taylor_(general)" title="Richard Taylor (general)">Richard Taylor</a>, son of President <a href="/wiki/Zachary_Taylor" title="Zachary Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, wrote a passage in his war memoirs about Jackson eating lemons: "Where Jackson got his lemons 'no fellow could find out,' but he was rarely without one."<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> However, recent research by his biographer, James I. Robertson, Jr., has found that none of his contemporaries, including members of his staff, friends, or his wife, recorded any unusual obsessions with lemons and Jackson thought of a lemon as a "rare treat ... enjoyed greatly whenever it could be obtained from the enemy's camp". Jackson was fond of all fruits, particularly peaches, "but he enjoyed with relish lemons, oranges, watermelons, apples, grapes, berries, or whatever was available."<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Command_style" id="Command_style"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Command style</span></h3>
<p>In command, Jackson was extremely secretive about his plans and extremely punctilious about military discipline. This secretive nature did not stand him in good stead with his subordinates, who were often not aware of his overall operational intentions and complained of being left out of key decisions.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Robert E. Lee could trust Jackson with deliberately non-detailed orders that conveyed Lee's overall objectives, what modern doctrine calls the "end state." This was because Jackson had a talent for understanding Lee's sometimes unstated goals and Lee trusted Jackson with the ability to take whatever actions were necessary to implement his end state requirements. Many of Lee's subsequent corps commanders did not have this disposition. At Gettysburg, this resulted in lost opportunities. Thus, after the Federals retreated to the heights south of town, Lee sent one of his new corps commanders, <a href="/wiki/Richard_S._Ewell" title="Richard S. Ewell">Richard S. Ewell</a>, discretionary orders that the heights (<a href="/wiki/Cemetery_Hill" title="Cemetery Hill">Cemetery Hill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Culp%27s_Hill" title="Culp's Hill">Culp's Hill</a>) be taken "if practicable." Without Jackson's intuitive grasp of Lee's orders and the intuition to take advantage of sudden tactical opportunities, Ewell chose not to attempt the assault, and this failure is considered by historians to be the greatest missed opportunity of the battle.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Horsemanship</span></h3>
<p>Jackson had a poor reputation as a horseman. One of his soldiers, Georgia volunteer William Andrews, wrote that Jackson was "a very ordinary looking man of medium size, his uniform badly soiled as though it had seen hard service. He wore a cap pulled down nearly to his nose and was riding a rawboned horse that did not look much like a charger, unless it would be on hay or clover. He certainly made a poor figure on a horseback, with his stirrup leather six inches too short, putting his knees nearly level with his horse's back, and his heels turned out with his toes sticking behind his horse's foreshoulder. A sorry description of our most famous general, but a correct one."<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> His horse was named "Little Sorrel" (also known as "Old Sorrel"), a small sorrel gelding.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> He rode Little Sorrel throughout the war, and was riding him when he was shot at Chancellorsville. Little Sorrel died at age 36 and is buried near a statue of Jackson on the parade grounds of VMI. (His mounted hide is on display in the VMI Museum.)<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The South mourned his death as he was greatly admired there. A poem penned by one of his soldiers soon became a very popular song, "<a href="/wiki/Stonewall_Jackson%27s_Way" title="Stonewall Jackson's Way">Stonewall Jackson's Way</a>."

Lee. The carving depicts the three on horseback, appearing to ride in a group from right to left across the mountainside. The lower parts of the horses' bodies merge into the mountainside at the foot of the carving. The three riders are shown bare-headed and holding their hats to their chests. It is the largest such carving in the world.</p>

<p>In the film <i><a href="/wiki/Shane_(film)" title="Shane (film)">Shane (1953)</a></i> the character Frank 'Stonewall' Torrey, played by <a href="/wiki/Elisha_Cook,_Jr." title="Elisha Cook, Jr.">Elisha Cook, Jr.</a>, is named after Jackson. He is provoked by gunman Jack Wilson, played by <a href="/wiki/Jack_Palance" title="Jack Palance">Jack Palance</a>, when told that: "I'm saying that Stonewall Jackson was trash himself. Him and Lee and all the rest of them rebs. You, too."</p>
<p>Jackson is featured prominently in the novel and film <i><a href="/wiki/Gods_and_Generals" title="Gods and Generals">Gods and Generals</a></i>. In the film, he is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Lang_(actor)" title="Stephen Lang (actor)">Stephen Lang</a>.</p>
<p>Jackson survives the Civil War, and commands Confederate Forces in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Mexican_War" title="Second Mexican War" class="mw-redirect">Second Mexican War</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Harry_Turtledove" title="Harry Turtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Timeline-191" title="Timeline-191">Timeline-191</a> series of <a href="/wiki/Alternate_history_(fiction)" title="Alternate history (fiction)" class="mw-redirect">alternate history</a> novels.</p>
<p>In the DC comic, <i><a href="/wiki/Jonah_Hex" title="Jonah Hex">Jonah Hex</a></i> (Jonah Hex #37), years after the Civil War, an old man tells the story of how Hex meets General Jackson and undertakes a special mission for him. At the end, the old man reveals that, although every boy North and South has learned in school that General "Stonewall" Jackson was accidentally shot by his own men, few know that the bullet that hit him was fired by Jonah Hex.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible; and when you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so long as your men have strength to follow; for an army routed, if hotly pursued, becomes panic-stricken, and can then be destroyed by half their number. The other rule is, never fight against heavy odds, if by any possible maneuvering you can hurl your own force on only a part, and that the weakest part, of your enemy and crush it. Such tactics will win every time, and a small army may thus destroy a large one in detail, and repeated victory will make it invincible.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>War means fighting. The business of the soldier is to fight. Armies are not called out to dig trenches,ks, to live in camps, but to find the enemy and strike him; to invade his country, and do him all possible damage in the shortest possible time. This will involve great destruction of life and property while it lasts; but such a war will of necessity be of brief continuance, and so would be an economy of life and property in the end.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

			<div class="dablink">This article is about the general legal concept.  For the book by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., see <a href="/wiki/The_Common_Law" title="The Common Law">The Common Law</a>.</div>
<p><b>Common law</b> refers to <a href="/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a> and the corresponding <a href="/wiki/Legal_systems_of_the_world" title="Legal systems of the world">legal system</a> developed through <a href="/wiki/Legal_opinion" title="Legal opinion">decisions</a> of <a href="/wiki/Courts" title="Courts" class="mw-redirect">courts</a> and similar tribunals (called <a href="/wiki/Case_law" title="Case law">case law</a>), rather than through <a href="/wiki/Statute_law" title="Statute law" class="mw-redirect">legislative statutes</a> or <a href="/wiki/Executive_(government)" title="Executive (government)">executive action</a>.</p>
<p>Common <a href="/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a> is law created and refined by <a href="/wiki/Judge" title="Judge">judges</a>: a decision in a currently pending <a href="/wiki/Legal_case" title="Legal case">legal case</a> depends on decisions in previous cases and affects the law to be applied in future cases. When there is no authoritative statement of the law, judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating <a href="/wiki/Precedent" title="Precedent">precedent</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><br /></p>
<p>The body of precedent is called "common law" and it binds future decisions. In future cases, when parties disagree on what the law is, an idealized common law court looks to past <a href="/wiki/Precedent" title="Precedent">precedential</a> decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is <a href="/wiki/Binding_precedent" title="Binding precedent">bound</a> to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as <i><a href="/wiki/Stare_decisis" title="Stare decisis">stare decisis</a></i>). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases, it will decide as a "<a href="/wiki/Case_of_first_impression" title="Case of first impression">matter of first impression</a>." Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and will bind future courts under the principle of <i><a href="/wiki/Stare_decisis" title="Stare decisis">stare decisis</a></i>.</p>
<p>In practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the idealized system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular <a href="/wiki/Jurisdiction" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>, and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by <a href="/wiki/Appellate_courts" title="Appellate courts" class="mw-redirect">appellate courts</a> are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of non-appellate courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_law" title="Constitutional law">constitutional law</a>, <a href="/wiki/Statutory" title="Statutory" class="mw-redirect">statutory</a> law and <a href="/wiki/Regulatory_law" title="Regulatory law" class="mw-redirect">regulatory law</a> also give rise to considerable complexity. However <i>stare decisis</i>, the principle that similar cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that they will reach similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.</p>
<p>Common law legal systems are in widespread use, particularly in those nations which trace their legal heritage to England, including the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, and other former colonies of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>. This should be contrasted with civil law legal systems (see section below).</p>

<p>The term <b>common law</b> has three main connotations and several historical meanings worth mentioning:</p>
<p><a name="1._Common_law_as_opposed_to_statutory_law_and_regulatory_law" id="1._Common_law_as_opposed_to_statutory_law_and_regulatory_law"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Common_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: 1.

Common law as opposed to <a href="/wiki/Statutory_law" title="Statutory law">statutory law</a> and regulatory law</span></h3>
<p>This connotation distinguishes between the authorities that promulgate a law. For example, in most areas of law in most <a href="/wiki/Jurisdiction" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdictions</a> in countries that trace their legal heritage to Britain (members of the <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> and the United States), there are "<a href="/wiki/Statute" title="Statute">statutes</a>" enacted by a <a href="/wiki/Legislature" title="Legislature">legislature</a>, "<a href="/wiki/Regulations" title="Regulations" class="mw-redirect">regulations</a>" promulgated by executive branch agencies pursuant to a delegation of rule-making authority from a legislature, and common law or "<a href="/wiki/Case_law" title="Case law">case law</a>", i.e., decisions issued by <a href="/wiki/Courts" title="Courts" class="mw-redirect">courts</a> (or quasi-judicial <a href="/wiki/Tribunal" title="Tribunal">tribunals</a> within agencies). This first connotation can be further differentiated, into (a) law arising purely from the common law with no express statutory authority, e.g., most <a href="/wiki/Criminal" title="Criminal" class="mw-redirect">criminal law</a> and procedural law before the 20th century, and even today, most of <a href="/wiki/Contract_law" title="Contract law" class="mw-redirect">contract law</a> and the law of torts, and (b) decisions that discuss and decide the fine boundaries and distinctions in law promulgated by other bodies, such as the <a href="/wiki/Constitution" title="Constitution">Constitution</a>, statutes and regulations.</p>
<p><a name="2._Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems" id="2._Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Common_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: 2.

Common law legal systems as opposed to <a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law legal systems</a></span></h3>
<p>This connotation differentiates "common law" jurisdictions and legal systems from "<a href="/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)" title="Civil law (legal system)">civil law</a>" or "<a href="/wiki/Codification" title="Codification">code</a>" jurisdictions. Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered "law" with the same force of law as statutes. By contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails in, or is combined with common law in, almost all non-Islamic, non-common law countries), judicial precedent is given relatively less weight, and scholarly literature is given relatively more. For example, the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_code" title="Napoleonic code">Napoleonic code</a> expressly forbade French judges from pronouncing the law.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a name="3._Law_as_opposed_to_equity" id="3._Law_as_opposed_to_equity"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Common_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: 3. Law as opposed to equity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">3. Law as opposed to equity</span></h3>
<p>This connotation differentiates "common law" (or just "law") from "<a href="/wiki/Equity_(law)" title="Equity (law)">equity</a>". Before 1873, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> had two parallel court systems: courts of "law" that could only award money damages and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of "equity" that could issue <a href="/wiki/Injunction" title="Injunction">injunctive relief</a> (that is, a court order to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized <a href="/wiki/Trust" title="Trust">trusts</a> of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States (see "Reception Statutes," below). The distinction between "law" and "equity" was important in:</p>
<ul>
<li>categorizing and prioritizing <a href="/wiki/Rights_to_property" title="Rights to property" class="mw-redirect">rights to property</a> - for example, the same article of property often has a "legal title" and an "equitable title," and these two groups of ownership rights may be held by different people.</li>
<li>in the United States, determining whether <a href="/wiki/Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution">the Seventh Amendment's</a> right to a <a href="/wiki/Jury_trial" title="Jury trial">jury trial</a> applies (a determination of a fact necessary to resolution of a "common law" claim<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>) or whether the issue will be decided by a <a href="/wiki/Judge" title="Judge">judge</a> (issues of what the law is, and all issues relating to equity).</li>
<li>the standard of review and degree of deference given by an appellate tribunal to the decision of the lower tribunal under review (issues of law are reviewed <i>de novo</i>, that is, "as if new" from scratch by the appellate tribunal, while most issues of equity are reviewed for "abuse of discretion," that is, with great deference to the tribunal below).</li>
<li>the remedies available and rules of procedure to be applied.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts. Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged together, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity (though under potentially different procedural law). Even so, the split survives and remains relevant for determining many issues in these classes. Other exceptions are discussed in "Common Law Systems," below.</p>
<p><a name="4._Historical_uses" id="4._Historical_uses"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Common_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: 4. Historical uses">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">4. Historical uses</span></h3>
<p>In addition, there are several historical uses of the term that provide some background as to its meaning. The English <a href="/wiki/English_Court_of_Common_Pleas" title="English Court of Common Pleas" class="mw-redirect">Court of Common Pleas</a> dealt with lawsuits in which the King had no interest, i.e. between commoners. Additionally, from at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by itinerant judges who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice. The term "common law" was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit. The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions. These definitions are archaic, their relevance having dissipated with the development of the English legal system over the centuries, but they do explain the origin of the term.</p>

<p>In a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine what "the law is" in a given situation. First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines what "the law is". Then, one applies that law to the facts.</p>

<p>The common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and social philosophy. Second, the common law evolves through a series of gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects. In contrast, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, and legislatures tend to delay acting until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (either positively or negatively).</p>
<p>One example of the gradual change that typifies the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. For example, the traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligence unless the two were in privity of contract. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. <a href="/wiki/Winterbottom_v._Wright" title="Winterbottom v. Wright" class="mw-redirect"><i>Winterbottom v. Wright</i></a>, 10 M&amp;W 109, 152 Eng.Rep. 402, 1842 WL 5519 (Exchequer of pleas 1842). In <i>Winterbottom</i>, the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The <i>Winterbottom</i> court recognized that there would be "absurd and outrageous consequences" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract ("privity") with the negligent party.</p>
<p>A first exception to this rule arose in <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/thomas_winchester.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>Thomas v. Winchester</i></a>, 6 N.Y. 397 (N.Y. 1852) which held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put "human life in imminent danger." <i>Thomas</i> used this as a reason to create an exception to the "privity" rule. In <i>Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.</i>, 195 N.Y. 478, 480 (N.Y. 1909) held that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn "was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed."</p>
<p>Yet the privity rule survived. In <i>Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson</i>, 221 F. 801 (2nd Cir. 1915) (decided by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner only had a contract with the automobile dealer, not with the manufacturer, even though there was "no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes."</p>
<p>Finally, in the famous case of <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/archives/macpherson_buick.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.</i></a>, 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (N.Y. 1916), Judge Cardozo pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to <i>Cadillac</i> a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:</p>
<dl>
<dd>We hold, then, that the principle of <i>Thomas v. Winchester</i> is not limited to poisons, explosives, and things of like nature, to things which in their normal operation are implements of destruction. If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. ... There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that Cardozo's new "rule" exists in no prior case, but is inferable as a synthesis of the "thing of danger" principle stated in them, merely extending it to "foreseeable danger" even if "the purposes for which it was designed" were not themselves "a source of great danger." <i>MacPherson</i> takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Note that Judge Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of <a href="/wiki/Winterbottom_v._Wright" title="Winterbottom v. Wright" class="mw-redirect"><i>Winterbottom</i></a>, that "absurd and outrageous consequences" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: "There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable." But while adhering to the underlying principle that <i>some</i> boundary is necessary, <a href="/wiki/MacPherson_v._Buick_Motor_Co." title="MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co."><i>MacPherson</i></a> overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.</p>
<p>This illustrates two crucial principles that are often not well understood by non-lawyers. (a) The law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have "made law" for hundreds of years. (b) The reasons given for a decision are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.</p>

<p>In common law legal systems (connotation 2), the common law (connotation 1) is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in <a href="/wiki/English_law" title="English law">England and Wales</a> and in most states of the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States" title="Law of the United States">United States</a>, the basic law of <a href="/wiki/Contract" title="Contract">contracts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tort" title="Tort">torts</a> and <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">property</a> do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). In almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup>, or the criminal law<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>), legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the common law (connotation 1). To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate <a href="/wiki/Precedent" title="Precedent">precedential</a> decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by <a href="/wiki/Analogy" title="Analogy">analogy</a>. To consider but one example, the <a href="/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> states "<a href="/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" – but interpretation (that is, determining the fine boundaries, and resolving the tension between the "establishment" and "free exercise" clauses) of each of the important terms was delegated by Article III of the Constitution to the judicial branch<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>, so that the current legal boundaries of the Constitutional text can only be determined by consulting the common law.</p>
<p>In common law jurisdictions, legislatures operate under the assumption that <a href="/wiki/Statute" title="Statute">statutes</a> will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law <a href="/wiki/Case_law" title="Case law">case law</a> and custom, and so may leave a number of things unsaid. For example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. (<a href="/wiki/Codification" title="Codification">Codification</a> is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document - when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated -- for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. For this reason, even today American law schools teach the common law of crime as practised in England in 1789, because the backdrop of centuries-old English common law is necessary to interpret and fully understand the literal words of the modern criminal statute.</p>
<p>With the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Constitution" title="U.S. Constitution" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Constitution</a>, which prohibited <a href="/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law" title="Ex post facto law">ex post facto laws</a> at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Hudson_and_Goodwin" title="United States v. Hudson and Goodwin">United States v. Hudson and Goodwin</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> which decided that common law crimes were prohibited (at least at the Federal level), and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.</p>
<p>However, many states retain selected common law crimes. Virginia, for example, recognizes robbery as a common law crime and the statute referencing robbery as a crime exists to set the punishment.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Virginia Code section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that "The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly".</p>
<p>By contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new <a href="/wiki/Cause_of_action" title="Cause of action">cause of action</a> that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the <a href="/wiki/Tort" title="Tort">tort</a> of <a href="/wiki/Wrongful_death" title="Wrongful death" class="mw-redirect">wrongful death</a>, which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or <a href="/wiki/Estate_(law)" title="Estate (law)">estate</a>, to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly – that is, limited to their precise terms – because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some "second order" <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_law" title="Constitutional law">constitutional law</a> provision (<i>cf</i>. <a href="/wiki/Judicial_activism" title="Judicial activism">judicial activism</a>).</p>
<p>Where a tort is rooted in common law, then all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those <a href="/wiki/Damages" title="Damages">damages</a> in the current <a href="/wiki/Statutory_law" title="Statutory law">statutory law</a>. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the <a href="/wiki/Negligence" title="Negligence">negligence</a> of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of quality of life, disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.</p>
<p>In the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority..." The first famous statement of "the judicial power" was <a href="/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison" title="Marbury v. Madison">Marbury v. Madison</a>. Later cases interpreted the "judicial power" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of congress or of any state that conflicts with the constitution.</p>

<p>Most of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting <i>en banc</i> (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since October 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.</p>
<p>Other courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit <i>en banc</i>, and thus the newer decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts - for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes - are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. The majority may persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.</p>
<p>In the UK, the Practice Statement of 1966 allows the House of Lords, in certain circumstances, to overrule a previous decision made in the same House.</p>

<p>The role of the legal academy presents a significant "cultural" difference between common law (connotation 2) and civil law jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In common law jurisdictions, legal treatises compile common law decisions, and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases. However, in common law jurisdictions, treatises are not the law, and lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only "finding aids" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the <a href="/wiki/Legal_history" title="Legal history">history and evolution of the law</a>, but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.</p>
<p>In contrast, in civil law jurisdictions, the writings of <a href="/wiki/Law_school" title="Law school">law professors</a> are given significant weight by courts. In part, this is because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale has to come from somewhere else, and the academy often filled that role. As civil law court decisions move in the direction of common law reasoning, it is possible that this balance may shift.</p>
<p><a name="Common_law_as_a_foundation_for_commercial_economies" id="Common_law_as_a_foundation_for_commercial_economies"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Common_law&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Common law as a foundation for commercial economies">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Common law as a foundation for commercial economies</span></h3>
<p>This reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is common law to give reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful. This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their freedom of expression rights apply.</p>
<p>In contrast, in non-common-law countries, and jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent (example, the U.S. Patent Office), fine questions of law are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less <i>a priori</i> guidance and must often leave a bigger "safety margin" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.</p>
<p>This is the reason for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contacts. Commercial contracts throughout the world (for example, in commercial contracts in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) almost always include a "choice of law clause," and the law chosen is often the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the nation's commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdiction. Similarly, corporations are often formed under Delaware corporate law, and contracts relating to corporate law issues (merger and acquisitions of companies, rights of shareholders, etc.) include a Delaware choice of law clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues. On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (e.g., the United Kingdom and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law. The common theme in each case is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law in order to achieve that result.</p>

<p>The term "common law" originally derives from after the <a href="/wiki/Norman_Conquest" title="Norman Conquest" class="mw-redirect">Norman Conquest</a>.

<p>Before the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest" title="Norman conquest" class="mw-redirect">Norman conquest</a> in 1066, justice was administered primarily by <a href="/wiki/County_courts" title="County courts" class="mw-redirect">county courts</a>, presided by the diocesan <a href="/wiki/Bishop" title="Bishop">bishop</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sheriff" title="Sheriff">sheriff</a>, exercising both <a href="/wiki/Ecclesiastical_jurisdiction" title="Ecclesiastical jurisdiction">ecclesiastical</a> and civil jurisdiction.<sup id="cite_ref-cath_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cath-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Trial by jury began in these courts.<sup id="cite_ref-cath_16-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cath-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1154, <a href="/wiki/Henry_II_of_England" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a> became the first <a href="/wiki/Plantagenet" title="Plantagenet" class="mw-redirect">Plantagenet</a> king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law "common" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a <a href="/wiki/Jury" title="Jury">jury</a> system – citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its <a href="/wiki/Verdict" title="Verdict">verdict</a> through evaluating common local knowledge, not necessarily through the presentation of <a href="/wiki/Evidence_(law)" title="Evidence (law)">evidence</a>, a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.</p>
<p>Henry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an ad hoc basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as <i><a href="/wiki/Stare_decisis" title="Stare decisis">stare decisis</a></i> (also commonly known as precedent) developed, which is where a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. By this system of precedent, decisions 'stuck' and became ossified, and so the pre-Norman system of disparate local customs was replaced by an elaborate and consistent system of law that was common throughout the whole country, hence the name, "common law."</p>
<p>Henry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of <a href="/wiki/Canon_law" title="Canon law">canonical</a> (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Becket" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Eventually, Becket was murdered inside Canterbury Cathedral by four knights who believed themselves to be acting on Henry's behalf. Whether Henry actually intended to bring about the assassination of Becket is doubtful, but there is no question that at the time of the murder, the two men were embroiled in a bitter dispute regarding the power of Royal Courts to exercise jurisdiction over former clergymen. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also <a href="/wiki/Constitutions_of_Clarendon" title="Constitutions of Clarendon">Constitutions of Clarendon</a>).</p>
<p>Judge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before <a href="/wiki/Parliament_of_England" title="Parliament of England">Parliament</a> acquired legislative powers to create <a href="/wiki/Statutory_law" title="Statutory law">statutory law</a>. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 1100s, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law - "legislating from the bench" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the "judicial power" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, a view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> emphasized in <a href="/wiki/The_Federalist" title="The Federalist" class="mw-redirect">The Federalist</a> that this New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject “to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.”<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.</p>
<p>One could note a certain irony: one of the first acts of many of the newly-independent states was to adopt the law of the foreign sovereign from whom independence had just been gained. But this is one more demonstration of the point mentioned above ("Common law as a foundation for commercial economies"), that the newly-independent states recognized the importance of a predictable and established body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses, and therefore adopted the richest available source of law.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance" title="Northwest Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a>, which was approved by the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation" title="Congress of the Confederation">Congress of the Confederation</a> in 1787, guaranteed "judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law." <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Dane" title="Nathan Dane">Nathan Dane</a>, the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed this provision as a default mechanism in the event that federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter; he wrote that if "a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law.”<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories where no states had yet been established.</p>
<p>Over time, as new states were formed from federal territories, these territorial reception statutes became obsolete and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington requires that "[t]he common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state."<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> In this way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state except <a href="/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> (which inherited a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Civil_law_(system)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Civil law (system) (page does not exist)">civil law</a> system from its <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> colonizers before the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, adopting a code similar to but not directly based on the <a href="/wiki/Napoleonic_code" title="Napoleonic code">Napoleonic Code</a> of 1804).</p>

<p>As early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common-law system would petition the <a href="/wiki/Monarch" title="Monarch" class="mw-redirect">King</a> in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at common law) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of <a href="/wiki/Equity_(law)" title="Equity (law)">equity</a>, administered by the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, in the courts of <a href="/wiki/Court_of_equity" title="Court of equity">chancery</a>. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other, even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail. A famous example is the fictional case of <a href="/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce" title="Jarndyce and Jarndyce">Jarndyce and Jarndyce</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Bleak_House" title="Bleak House">Bleak House</a></i>, by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Dickens" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-lobban_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lobban-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In England, courts of law and equity were combined by the <a href="/wiki/Judicature_Acts" title="Judicature Acts">Judicature Acts</a> of 1873 and 1875, with equity being supreme in case of conflict.<sup id="cite_ref-lobban_29-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lobban-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, parallel systems of law (providing money <a href="/wiki/Damages" title="Damages">damages</a>, with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_federal_courts" title="United States federal courts">United States federal courts</a> procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new <a href="/wiki/Federal_Rules_of_Civil_Procedure" title="Federal Rules of Civil Procedure">Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</a> combined law and equity into one form of action, the "civil action." Fed.R.Civ.P. 2. The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were "common law" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the <a href="/wiki/Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution">Seventh Amendment</a>) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and "equity" issues are decided by a judge.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> is often said to use the civil law system but in fact it has <a href="/wiki/Scots_law" title="Scots law">a unique system</a> that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the <a href="/wiki/Corpus_Juris_Civilis" title="Corpus Juris Civilis">Corpus Juris Civilis</a> with an element of common law long predating the <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Union_(1707)" title="Act of Union (1707)" class="mw-redirect">Treaty of Union</a> with England in 1707 (see <a href="/wiki/Legal_institutions_of_Scotland_in_the_High_Middle_Ages" title="Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages">Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages</a>).

The reason for the enactment of the codes in California in the nineteenth century was to replace a pre-existing system based on <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a> civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other <a href="/wiki/Western_United_States" title="Western United States">Western states</a>, however, have retained the concept of <a href="/wiki/Community_property" title="Community property">community property</a> derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case <i><a href="/wiki/Li_v._Yellow_Cab_Co." title="Li v. Yellow Cab Co.">Li v. Yellow Cab Co.</a></i>, 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the <a href="/wiki/California_Supreme_Court" title="California Supreme Court" class="mw-redirect">California Supreme Court</a> adopted the principle of <a href="/wiki/Comparative_negligence" title="Comparative negligence">comparative negligence</a> in the face of a <a href="/wiki/California_Civil_Code" title="California Civil Code">California Civil Code</a> provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Contributory_negligence" title="Contributory negligence">contributory negligence</a>.)</p>
<p>The state of <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, which also has a civil law history from its <a href="/wiki/Dutch_colonization_of_the_Americas" title="Dutch colonization of the Americas">Dutch colonial</a> days, also began a <a href="/wiki/Codification" title="Codification">codification</a> of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the <a href="/wiki/Field_Code" title="Field Code" class="mw-redirect">Field Code</a> applying to civil procedure. The original colony of <a href="/wiki/New_Netherlands" title="New Netherlands" class="mw-redirect">New Netherlands</a> was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_England" title="Kingdom of England">English</a> captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was <a href="/wiki/Second_Anglo-Dutch_War" title="Second Anglo-Dutch War">recaptured</a> by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the <a href="/wiki/Patroon" title="Patroon">patroonsystem</a> of land holding, based on the feudal system and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-nineteenth century. The influence of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Dutch_law" title="Roman Dutch law">Roman Dutch law</a> continued in the colony well into the late nineteenth century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> continued on from the Dutch days.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. <a href="/wiki/United_States_federal_courts" title="United States federal courts">United States federal courts</a> only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution (to elaborate and precisely define the broad language, connotation 1(b) above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law (connotation 1(a) above). Before 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution. In 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in <i><a href="/wiki/Erie_Railroad_Co._v._Tompkins" title="Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins">Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins</a></i> <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=304&amp;page=64" rel="nofollow">304 U.S. 64, 78</a> (1938), overruled earlier precedent<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>, and held "There is no federal general common law," thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. <i>E.g.</i>, <i>Texas Industries v.

Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.

William Blackstone as illustrated in his <i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The definitive historical treatise on the common law is <i><a href="/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Laws_of_England" title="Commentaries on the Laws of England">Commentaries on the Laws of England</a></i>, written by Sir <a href="/wiki/William_Blackstone" title="William Blackstone">William Blackstone</a> and first published in 1765 - 1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> by <a href="/wiki/Halsbury%27s_Laws_of_England" title="Halsbury's Laws of England">Halsbury's Laws of England</a> that covers both common and statutory English law.</p>
<p>While he was still on the <a href="/wiki/Massachusetts_Supreme_Judicial_Court" title="Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a>, and before being named to the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Supreme_Court" title="U.S. Supreme Court" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, Justice <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Jr." title="Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr." class="mw-redirect">Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.</a> published a short volume called <i><a href="/wiki/The_Common_Law" title="The Common Law">The Common Law</a></i> which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law <i>is</i>; rather, Holmes describes the common law <i>process</i>. Law professor <a href="/wiki/John_Chipman_Gray" title="John Chipman Gray">John Chipman Gray</a>'s <i>The Nature and Sources of the Law</i>, an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in <a href="/wiki/Law_school_in_the_United_States" title="Law school in the United States">U.S. law schools</a>.</p>
<p>In the United States, <a href="/wiki/Restatement_of_the_Law" title="Restatement of the Law" class="mw-redirect">Restatements</a> of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, etc.), edited by the <a href="/wiki/American_Law_Institute" title="American Law Institute">American Law Institute</a>, collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly-persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The <a href="/wiki/Corpus_Juris_Secundum" title="Corpus Juris Secundum">Corpus Juris Secundum</a> is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Scots <i>common law</i> covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called <i>Institutional Texts</i> and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, <i>Jus Feudale</i> (1655) and Stair, <i>The Institutions of the Law of Scotland</i> (1681).</p>

<li id="cite_note-11"><b><a href="#cite_ref-11" title="">^</a></b> At least in the U.S., practicing lawyers tend to use "law professor" or "law review article" as a pejorative to describe a person or work that is insufficiently grounded in reality or practicality - every young lawyer is admonished repeatedly by senior lawyers not to write "law review articles," but instead to focus on the facts of the case and the practical effects of a given outcome.</li>

This is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of applicable facts in a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures – but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read. As a practical matter, no civil law legislature can ever address the full spectrum of factual possibilities in the breadth, depth and detail of the case law of the common law courts of even a smaller jurisdiction.</li>

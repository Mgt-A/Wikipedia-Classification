According to translator <a href="/wiki/William_Scott_Wilson" title="William Scott Wilson">William Scott Wilson</a>: "In Chinese, the character 侍 was originally a verb meaning to wait upon or accompany a person in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese, saburau. In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean "those who serve in close attendance to the nobility," the pronunciation in Japanese changing to saburai." According to Wilson, an early reference to the word Samurai appears in the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/kokinshu/index.html" class="external text" title="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/kokinshu/index.html" rel="nofollow">Kokinshu</a>, the first imperial anthology of poems, completed in the first part of the tenth century.</p>

The samurai followed a set of written rules called the <a href="/wiki/Bushid%C5%8D" title="Bushidō">Bushidō</a> .</p>

<p>Following a disastrous <a href="/wiki/Military" title="Military">military</a> engagement with <a href="/wiki/Tang_Dynasty" title="Tang Dynasty">Tang</a> <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> and <a href="/wiki/Silla" title="Silla">Silla</a>, Japan underwent widespread reform. One of the most important was that of the <a href="/wiki/Taika_Reform" title="Taika Reform">Taika Reform</a>, issued by Prince Naka no Ōe (<a href="/wiki/Emperor_Tenji" title="Emperor Tenji">Emperor Tenji</a>) in 646 AD.

With an understanding of how the population was distributed, <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Mommu" title="Emperor Mommu">Emperor Mommu</a> introduced the law whereby 1 in 3–4 adult males were drafted into the national military. These soldiers were required to supply their own weapons, and in return were exempted from duties and taxes.<sup id="cite_ref-HW_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HW-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This was one of the first attempts by the Imperial government to form an organized army modeled after the Chinese system.

<p>The Taihō Code classified imperial bureaucrats into 12 ranks, each divided into two sub-ranks, 1st rank being the highest adviser to the emperor. Those of 6th rank and below were referred to as "samurai" and dealt with day-to-day affairs. Although these "samurai" were civilian public servants, the name is believed to have derived from this term. Military men, however, would not be referred to as "samurai" for many more centuries.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

Skilled in mounted combat and <a href="/wiki/Archery" title="Archery">archery</a> (<a href="/wiki/Ky%C5%ABd%C5%8D" title="Kyūdō">kyūdō</a>), these clan warriors became the emperor's preferred tool for putting down rebellions.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Although these warriors may have been educated, at this time (7th to 9th century) the imperial court officials considered them to be little more than barbarians.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Ultimately, Emperor Kammu disbanded his army, and from this time, the emperor's power gradually declined.

<p>In the 13th century, <a href="/wiki/Hojo_Shigetoki" title="Hojo Shigetoki" class="mw-redirect">Hojo Shigetoki</a> (1198-1261 A.D.) would write: "When one is serving officially or in the master's court, he should not think of a hundred or a thousand people, but should consider only the importance of the master."</p>
<p>Feudal lords such as Shiba Yoshimasa (1350-1410 A.D.) stated that a warrior looked forward to a glorious death in the service of a military leader or the emperor: "It is a matter of regret to let the moment when one should die pass by....First, a man whose profession is the use of arms should think and then act upon not only his own fame, but also that of his de­scendants. He should not scandalize his name forever by holding his one and only life too dear....One's main purpose in throwing away his life is to do so either for the sake of the Emperor or in some great undertaking of a military general. It is that exactly that will be the great fame of one's de­scendants."</p>
<p>Shiba also emphasized that warriors should not expect compensation for their service: "There are men who don't believe that when one is serving the lord, he first receives the lord's favor and only then makes endeavors in loyalty and his duties. They have understood the matter in reverse. Being able to live in this world is from the beginning by the grace of one's lord. It is a sad thing for men to forget this and, while setting their ambitions yet higher, envy their masters and the world at large."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>In 1412 A.D., <a href="/wiki/Imagawa_Sadayo" title="Imagawa Sadayo">Imagawa Sadayo</a> wrote a letter of admonishment to his brother stressing the importance of duty to one's master. Imagawa was admired for his balance of military and administrative skills during his lifetime and his writings became widespread. The letters became central to Tokugawa-era laws and were a required study for traditional Japanese until World War II:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"First of all, a samurai who dislikes battle and has not put his heart in the right place even though he has been born in the house of the warrior, should not be reckoned among one's retainers....It is forbidden to forget the great debt of kindness one owes to his master and ancestors and thereby make light of the virtues of loyalty and filial piety....It is forbidden that one should...attach little importance to his duties to his master...There is a primary need to distinguish loyalty from disloyalty and to establish rewards and punishments"</dd>
</dl>
<p>Similarly. the feudal lord <a href="/wiki/Takeda_Nobushige" title="Takeda Nobushige">Takeda Nobushige</a> (1525-1561 A.D.) stated: "In matters both great and small, one should not turn his back on his master's commands...One should not ask for gifts or enfiefments from the master...No matter how unreasonably the master may treat a man, he should not feel disgruntled...An underling does not pass judgments on a superior"</p>
<p>Nobushige's brother <a href="/wiki/Takeda_Shingen" title="Takeda Shingen">Takeda Shingen</a> (1521-1573 A.D.) also made similar observations: "One who was born in the house of a warrior, regardless of his rank or class, first acquaints himself with a man of military feats and achievements in loyalty....Everyone knows that if a man doesn't hold filial piety toward his own parents he would also neglect his duties toward his lord. Such a neglect means a disloyalty toward humanity. Therefore such a man doesn't deserve to be called 'samurai'."</p>
<p>The feudal lord <a href="/wiki/Asakura_Yoshikage" title="Asakura Yoshikage">Asakura Yoshikage</a> (1428-1481 A.D.) wrote: "In the fief of the Asakura, one should not determine hereditary chief retainers. A man should be assigned according to his ability and loyalty." Asakura also observed that the successes of his father were obtained by the kind treatment of the warriors and common people living in domain. By his civility, "all were willing to sacrifice their lives for him and become his allies."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Kato_Kiyomasa" title="Kato Kiyomasa" class="mw-redirect">Kato Kiyomasa</a> was one of the most powerful and well-known lords of the Sengoku Era. He commanded most of Japan's major clans during the invasion of Korea (1592-1598). In a handbook he addressed to "all samurai, regardless of rank" he told his followers that a warrior's only duty in life was to "grasp the long and the short swords and to die". He also orders his followers to put forth great effort in studying the military classics, especially those related to loyalty and filial piety. He is best known for his quote:</p>
<p>"If a man does not investigate into the matter of Bushido daily, it will be difficult for him to die a brave and manly death. Thus it is essential to engrave this business of the warrior into one's mind well."</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Nabeshima_Naoshige" title="Nabeshima Naoshige">Nabeshima Naoshige</a> (1538-1618 A.D.) was another Sengoku Daimyo who fought alongside Kato Kiyomasa in Korea. He stated that it was shameful for any man to have not risked his life at least once in the line of duty, regardless of his rank. Nabeshima's sayings would be passed down to his son and grandson and would become the basis for <a href="/wiki/Tsunetomo_Yamamoto" title="Tsunetomo Yamamoto" class="mw-redirect">Tsunetomo Yamamoto</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Hagakure" title="Hagakure">Hagakure</a>. He is best-known for his saying "Bushido is in being crazy to die. Fifty or more could not kill one such a man."</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Torii_Mototada" title="Torii Mototada">Torii Mototada</a> (1539-1600) was a feudal lord in the service of Tokugawa Ieyasu. On the eve of the battle of <a href="/wiki/Sekigahara" title="Sekigahara" class="mw-redirect">Sekigahara</a>, he volunteered to remain behind in the doomed <a href="/wiki/Fushimi_Castle" title="Fushimi Castle">Fushimi Castle</a> while his lord advanced to the east. Torii and Tokugawa both agreed that the castle was indefensible. In an act of loyalty to his lord, Torii chose to remain behind, pledging that he and his men would fight to the finish. As was custom, Torii vowed that he would not be taken alive. In a dramatic last stand, the garrison of 2,000 men held out against overwhelming odds for ten days against the massive army of Ishida Mitsunari's 40,000 warriors. In a moving <a href="http://se2.isn.ch/serviceengine/FileContent?serviceID=23&amp;fileid=A2ACEFA7-841A-1AB5-38EF-4F01450AC856&amp;lng=en" class="external text" title="http://se2.isn.ch/serviceengine/FileContent?serviceID=23&amp;fileid=A2ACEFA7-841A-1AB5-38EF-4F01450AC856&amp;lng=en" rel="nofollow">last statement</a> to his son Tadamasa, he wrote:</p>
<p>"It is not the Way of the Warrior [i.e., bushido] to be shamed and avoid death even under circumstances that are not particularly important. It goes without saying that to sacrifice one's life for the sake of his master is an unchanging principle. That I should be able to go ahead of all the other warriors of this country and lay down my life for the sake of my master's benevolence is an honor to my family and has been my most fervent desire for many years."</p>
<p>It is said that both men cried when they parted ways, because they knew they would never see each other again. Torii's father and grandfather had served the Tokugawa before him and his own brother had already been killed in battle. Torii's actions changed the course of Japanese history. Ieyasu Tokugawa would successfully raise an army and win at <a href="/wiki/Sekigahara" title="Sekigahara" class="mw-redirect">Sekigahara</a>.</p>
<p>The translator of Hagakure, <a href="/wiki/William_Scott_Wilson" title="William Scott Wilson">William Scott Wilson</a> observed examples of warrior emphasis on death in clans other than Yamamoto's: "he (Takeda Shingen) was a strict disciplinarian as a warrior, and there is an ex­emplary story in the Hagakure relating his execution of two brawl­ers, not because they had fought, but because they had not fought to the death." <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The rival of <a href="/wiki/Takeda_Shingen" title="Takeda Shingen">Takeda Shingen</a> {1521-1573} was <a href="/wiki/Uesugi_Kenshin" title="Uesugi Kenshin">Uesugi Kenshin</a> (1530-1578), a legendary Sengoku warlord well-versed in the Chinese military classics and who advocated the "way of the warrior as death". Japanese historian Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki describes Uesugi's beliefs in his text <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691017700" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691017700" rel="nofollow">"Zen and Japanese Culture"</a> (1959):</p>
<p>"Those who are reluctant to give up their lives and embrace death are not true warriors.... Go to the battlefield firmly confident of victory, and you will come home with no wounds whatever. Engage in combat fully determined to die and you will be alive; wish to survive in the battle and you will surely meet death. When you leave the house determined not to see it again you will come home safely; when you have any thought of returning you will not return. You may not be in the wrong to think that the world is always subject to change, but the warrior must not entertain this way of thinking, for his fate is always determined."</p>
<p>Families such as the Imagawa were influential in the development of warrior ethics and were widely quoted by other lords during their lifetime. The writings of <a href="/wiki/Imagawa_Sadayo" title="Imagawa Sadayo">Imagawa Sadayo</a> were highly respected and sought out by Tokugawa Ieyasu as the source of <a href="http://www.uni-erfurt.de/ostasiatische_geschichte/texte/japan/dokumente/17/tokugawa_legislation/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.uni-erfurt.de/ostasiatische_geschichte/texte/japan/dokumente/17/tokugawa_legislation/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Japanese Feudal Law</a>. These writings were a required study among traditional Japanese until World War II.</p>
<p>In his book "Japanese Culture" (2000), historian H. Paul Varley notes the description of Japan given by Jesuit leader <a href="/wiki/St._Francis_Xavier" title="St. Francis Xavier" class="mw-redirect">St. Francis Xavier</a> (1506-1552): "There is no nation in the world which fears death less." Xavier further <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/lifelettersofstf01coleuoft" class="external text" title="http://www.archive.org/details/lifelettersofstf01coleuoft" rel="nofollow">describes</a> the honor and manners of the people: "I fancy that there are no people in the world more punctilious about their honour than the Japanese, for they will not put up with a single insult or even a word spoken in anger." Xavier spent the years 1549-1551 converting Japanese to Christianity. He also observed: "The Japanese are much braver and more warlike than the people of China, Korea, Ternate and all of the other nations around the Philippines."</p>
<p>In December 1547, Francis was in Malacca (Malaysia) waiting to return to Goa (India) when he met a low-ranked samurai named Anjiro (possibly spelled "Yajiro"). Anjiro was not a nobleman or an intellectual, but he impressed Xavier because he took careful notes of everything he said in church. Xavier made the decision to go to Japan in part because this low-ranking samurai convinced him in Portuguese that the Japanese people were highly educated and eager to learn. They were hard workers and respectful of authority. In their laws and customs they were led by reason, and, should the Christian faith convince them of its truth, they would accept it en masse.<sup id="cite_ref-Coleridge_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Coleridge-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By the 12th century, upper-class samurai were highly literate due to the general introduction of Confucianism from China during the 7th to 9th centuries, and in response to their perceived need to deal with the imperial court, who had a monopoly on culture and literacy for most of the Heian period. As a result they aspired to the more cultured abilities of the nobility.<sup id="cite_ref-Matsura_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Matsura-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Examples such as Taira Tadanori (a samurai who appears in the <a href="/wiki/Heike_Monogatari" title="Heike Monogatari" class="mw-redirect">Heike Monogatari</a>) demonstrate that warriors idealized the arts and aspired to become skilled in them.</p>
<p>Tadanori was famous for his skill with the pen and the sword or the "bun and the bu", the harmony of fighting and learning. Samurai were expected to be cultured and literate, and admired the ancient saying "Bun Bu Ryo Do" (文武両道, lit., literary arts, military arts, both ways) or "The pen and the sword in accord." By the time of the Edo period, Japan had a higher literacy rate than Europe.</p>
<p>The number of men who actually achieved the ideal and lived their lives by it was high. An early term for warrior, "uruwashii", was written with a kanji that combined the characters for literary study ("bun" 文) and military arts ("bu" 武), and is mentioned in the Heike Monogatari (late 12th century). The Heike Monogatari makes reference to the educated poet-swordsman ideal in its mention of Taira no Tadanori's death:</p>
<p>"Friends and foes alike wet their sleeves with tears and said,</p>
<p>What a pity! Tadanori was a great general,</p>
<p>pre-eminent in the arts of <b>both sword and poetry</b>."</p>
<p>In his book <a href="/w/index.php?title=%22Ideals_of_the_Samurai%22&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="&quot;Ideals of the Samurai&quot; (page does not exist)">"Ideals of the Samurai"</a> translator <a href="/wiki/William_Scott_Wilson" title="William Scott Wilson">William Scott Wilson</a> states: "The warriors in the <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/heike/heike.html" class="external text" title="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/heike/heike.html" rel="nofollow">Heike Monogatari</a> served as models for the educated warriors of later generations, and the ideals depicted by them were not assumed to be beyond reach. Rather, these ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society and recommended as the proper form of the Japanese man of arms. With the Heike Monogatari, the image of the Japanese warrior in literature came to its full maturity." Wilson then translates the writings of several warriors who mention the Heike Monogatari as an example for their men to follow.</p>
<p>Plenty of warrior writings document this ideal from the 13th century onward. Most warriors aspired to or followed this ideal otherwise there would have been no cohesion in the samurai armies.<sup id="cite_ref-Wilson_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wilson-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Originally the emperor and nobility employed these warriors. In time, they amassed enough manpower, resources and political backing in the form of alliances with one another, to establish the first samurai-dominated government.</p>
<p>As the power of these regional clans grew, their chief was typically a distant relative of the emperor, and a lesser member of either the <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_clan" title="Fujiwara clan">Fujiwara</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minamoto" title="Minamoto" class="mw-redirect">Minamoto</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Taira" title="Taira" class="mw-redirect">Taira</a> clans.</p>
<p>Though originally sent to provincial areas for a fixed four-year term as a magistrate, the <i>toryo</i> declined to return to the capital when their terms ended, and their sons inherited their positions and continued to lead the clans in putting down rebellions throughout Japan during the middle- and later-Heian period.</p>
<p>Samurai fought at the naval battle of <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Dan-no-ura" title="Battle of Dan-no-ura">Dan-no-Ura</a> in 1185. Because of their rising military and economic power, the warriors ultimately became a new force in the politics of the court. Their involvement in the <a href="/wiki/H%C5%8Dgen_(era)" title="Hōgen (era)">Hōgen</a> in the late Heian period consolidated their power, and finally pitted the rival <a href="/wiki/Minamoto" title="Minamoto" class="mw-redirect">Minamoto</a> and <a href="/wiki/Taira" title="Taira" class="mw-redirect">Taira</a> clans against each other in the <a href="/wiki/Heiji_Rebellion" title="Heiji Rebellion">Heiji Rebellion</a> of 1160.</p>
<p>The winner, <a href="/wiki/Taira_no_Kiyomori" title="Taira no Kiyomori">Taira no Kiyomori</a>, became an imperial advisor, and was the first warrior to attain such a position. He eventually seized control of the central government, establishing the first samurai-dominated government and relegating the emperor to figurehead status.</p>
<p>However, the Taira clan was still very conservative when compared to its eventual successor, the Minamoto, and instead of expanding or strengthening its military might, the Taira clan had its women marry emperors and exercise control through the emperor.</p>
<p>The Taira and the Minamoto clashed again in 1180, beginning the <a href="/wiki/Gempei_War" title="Gempei War" class="mw-redirect">Gempei War</a> which ended in 1185. The victorious <a href="/wiki/Minamoto_no_Yoritomo" title="Minamoto no Yoritomo">Minamoto no Yoritomo</a> established the superiority of the samurai over the aristocracy. In 1190 he visited Kyoto, and in 1192 became <a href="/wiki/Shogun" title="Shogun">Seii Taishogun</a>, establishing the Kamakura Shogunate, or <i>Kamakura Bakufu</i>. Instead of ruling from Kyoto, he set up the Shogunate in <a href="/wiki/Kamakura,_Kanagawa" title="Kamakura, Kanagawa">Kamakura</a>, near his base of power. "Bakufu" means "tent government", taken from the encampments the soldiers would live in, in accordance with the Bakufu's status as a military government.</p>
<p>Over time, powerful samurai clans became warrior nobility, or "<i>buke</i>", who were only nominally under the court aristocracy. When the samurai began to adopt aristocratic pastimes like <a href="/wiki/Calligraphy" title="Calligraphy">calligraphy</a>, poetry and music, some court aristocrats in turn began to adopt samurai customs. In spite of various machinations and brief periods of rule by various emperors, real power was now in the hands of the Shogun and the samurai.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Zen_Buddhism" title="Zen Buddhism" class="mw-redirect">Zen Buddhism</a> spread among the samurai in the 13th century and helped to shape their standards of conduct, particularly overcoming fear of death and killing, but among the general populace, <a href="/wiki/Pure_Land_Buddhism" title="Pure Land Buddhism">Pure Land Buddhism</a> was favored.</p>
<p>In 1274, the Mongol-founded <a href="/wiki/Yuan_Dynasty" title="Yuan Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a> in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> sent a force of some 40,000 men and 900 ships to invade Japan in northern <a href="/wiki/Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB" title="Kyūshū">Kyūshū</a>. Japan mustered a mere 10,000 samurai to meet this threat. The invading army was harassed by major thunderstorms throughout the <a href="/wiki/Invasion" title="Invasion">invasion</a>, which aided the defenders by inflicting heavy casualties. The Yuan army was eventually recalled and the invasion was called off. The Mongol invaders used small <a href="/wiki/Bomb" title="Bomb">bombs</a>, which was likely the first appearance of bombs and <a href="/wiki/Gunpowder" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> in Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese defenders recognized the possibility of a renewed invasion, and began construction of a great, stone barrier around <a href="/wiki/Hakata_Bay" title="Hakata Bay">Hakata Bay</a> in 1276. Completed in 1277, this wall stretched for 20 kilometers around the border of the bay. This would later serve as a strong defensive point against the Mongols. The Mongols attempted to settle matters in a diplomatic way from 1275 to 1279, but every envoy sent to Japan was executed. This set the stage for one of the most famous engagements in Japanese history.</p>
<p>In 1281, a Yuan army of 140,000 men with 5,000 ships was mustered for another invasion of Japan. Northern Kyūshū was defended by a Japanese army of 40,000 men. The Mongol army was still on its ships preparing for the landing operation when a typhoon hit north Kyūshū island. The casualties and damage inflicted by the typhoon, followed by the Japanese defense of the Hakata Bay barrier, resulted in the Mongols again recalling their armies.</p>

<p>The thunderstorms of 1274 and the typhoon of 1281 helped the samurai defenders of Japan repel the Mongol invaders despite being vastly outnumbered. These winds became known as <i>kami-no-kaze</i>, which literally translates as "wind of the gods." This is often given a simplified translation as "divine wind." The <i>kami-no-kaze</i> lent credence to the Japanese belief that their lands were indeed divine and under supernatural protection.</p>
<p>In the 14th century, a blacksmith called <a href="/wiki/Masamune" title="Masamune">Masamune</a> developed a two-layer structure of soft and hard steel for use in swords. This structure gave much improved cutting power and endurance, and the production technique led to Japanese swords (<a href="/wiki/Katana" title="Katana">katana</a>) being recognized as some of the most potent hand weapons of pre-industrial <a href="/wiki/East_Asia" title="East Asia">East Asia</a>.

<p>Issues of inheritance caused family strife as <a href="/wiki/Primogeniture" title="Primogeniture">primogeniture</a> became common, in contrast to the division of succession designated by law before the 14th century. To avoid infighting, invasions of neighboring samurai territories became common and bickering among samurai was a constant problem for the <a href="/wiki/Kamakura_Shogunate" title="Kamakura Shogunate" class="mw-redirect">Kamakura</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ashikaga_Shogunate" title="Ashikaga Shogunate" class="mw-redirect">Ashikaga</a> Shogunates.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Sengoku_Period" title="Sengoku Period" class="mw-redirect">Sengoku jidai</a></i> ("warring-states period") was marked by the loosening of samurai culture with people born into other social strata sometimes making names for themselves as warriors and thus becoming <a href="/wiki/De_facto" title="De facto">de facto</a> samurai. In this turbulent period, <a href="/wiki/Bushido" title="Bushido" class="mw-redirect">bushido</a> ethics became important factors in controlling and maintaining public order.</p>

<p>By the end of feudal period, several hundred thousand firearms existed in Japan and massive armies numbering over 100,000 clashed in battles. By comparison, the largest and most powerful army in Europe, the <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a>, had only several thousand firearms and could only assemble 30,000 troops.</p>
<p>In 1590, and again in 1598, <a href="/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" title="Toyotomi Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> decided to invade <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">唐入り</span>) and sent to <a href="/wiki/Korea" title="Korea">Korea</a> an army of 160,000 samurai (<a href="/wiki/Hideyoshi%27s_invasions_of_Korea" title="Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea" class="mw-redirect">Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea</a>, <span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">朝鮮征伐</span>). Taking advantage of its mastery of the arquebus, Japanese samurai almost led the war to victory, but were unable to do so, due to the entry of <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">Ming Chinese</a> troops. A few of the more famous samurai generals of this war were <a href="/wiki/Kat%C5%8D_Kiyomasa" title="Katō Kiyomasa">Katō Kiyomasa</a>, <a href="/wiki/Konishi_Yukinaga" title="Konishi Yukinaga">Konishi Yukinaga</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Shimazu_Yoshihiro" title="Shimazu Yoshihiro">Shimazu Yoshihiro</a>.</p>
<p>Social mobility was high, as the ancient regime collapsed and emerging samurai needed to maintain large military and administrative organizations in their areas of influence. Most of the samurai families that survived to the 19th century originated in this era, declaring themselves to be the blood of one of the four ancient noble clans, <a href="/wiki/Minamoto" title="Minamoto" class="mw-redirect">Minamoto</a>, <a href="/wiki/Taira" title="Taira" class="mw-redirect">Taira</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fujiwara_clan" title="Fujiwara clan">Fujiwara</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tachibana_clan_(samurai)" title="Tachibana clan (samurai)">Tachibana</a>.

<p>Oda Nobunaga made innovations in the fields of organization and war tactics, heavily used arquebuses, developed commerce and industry and treasured innovation. Consecutive victories enabled him to realize the termination of the Ashikaga Bakufu and the disarmament of the military powers of the Buddhist monks, which had inflamed futile struggles among the populace for centuries.

Hideyoshi was brought up from a nameless peasant to be one of Nobunaga's top generals and Ieyasu had shared his childhood with Nobunaga. Hideyoshi defeated Mitsuhide within a month and was regarded as the rightful successor of Nobunaga by avenging the treachery of Mitsuhide.</p>
<p>These two were gifted with Nobunaga's previous achievements on which build a unified Japan and there was a saying: "The reunification is a rice cake; Oda made it. Hashiba shaped it.

<p><a href="/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" title="Toyotomi Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, who became a grand minister in 1586, himself the son of a poor peasant family, created a law that the samurai caste became codified as permanent and hereditary, and that non-samurai were forbidden to carry weapons, thereby ending the social mobility of Japan up until that point, which lasted until the dissolution of the Edo Shogunate by the Meiji revolutionaries.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the distinction between samurai and non-samurai was so obscure that during the 16th century, most male adults in any social class (even small farmers) belonged to at least one military organization of their own and served in wars before and during Hideyoshi's rule.

<p>During the <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_era" title="Tokugawa era" class="mw-redirect">Tokugawa era</a>, samurai increasingly became courtiers, bureaucrats, and administrators rather than warriors. With no warfare since the early 17th century, samurai gradually lost their military function during the <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate" title="Tokugawa shogunate">Tokugawa era</a> (also called the <a href="/wiki/Edo_period" title="Edo period">Edo period</a>).</p>
<p>By the end of the Tokugawa era, samurai were aristocratic bureaucrats for the <a href="/wiki/Daimyo" title="Daimyo">daimyo</a>, with their <i><a href="/wiki/Daisho" title="Daisho" class="mw-redirect">daisho</a></i>, the paired long and short swords of the samurai (cf. <a href="/wiki/Katana" title="Katana">katana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wakizashi" title="Wakizashi">wakizashi</a>) becoming more of a symbolic emblem of power rather than a weapon used in daily life.</p>
<p>They still had the legal right to cut down any <a href="/wiki/Commoner" title="Commoner">commoner</a> who did not show proper respect (<i><a href="/wiki/Kiri_sute_gomen" title="Kiri sute gomen">kiri sute gomen</a></i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">斬り捨て御免</span>)), but to what extent this right was used is unknown. When the central government forced daimyos to cut the size of their armies, unemployed <a href="/wiki/Ronin" title="Ronin">ronin</a> became a social problem.</p>
<p>Theoretical obligations between a samurai and his lord (usually a daimyo) increased from the Genpei era to the Edo era. They were strongly emphasized by the teachings of <a href="/wiki/Confucius" title="Confucius">Confucius</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mencius" title="Mencius">Mencius</a> (ca 550 B.C.) which were required reading for the educated samurai class. Bushido was formalized by several influential leaders and families before the Edo Period. Bushido was an ideal, and it remained fairly uniform from the 13th century to the 19th century — the ideals of Bushido transcended social class, time and geographic location of the warrior class.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bushido" title="Bushido" class="mw-redirect">Bushido</a> was formalized by samurai such as Imagawa Ryoshun as early as the 13th century. The conduct of samurai served as role model behavior for the other social classes. With time on their hands, samurai spent more time in pursuit of other interests such as becoming scholars.</p>
<p>Bushido still survives in present-day Japanese society, as do many other aspects of the samurai's way of life.</p>

<p>From 1854, the samurai army and the navy were modernized.

<p>French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as <a href="/wiki/Yokosuka" title="Yokosuka" class="mw-redirect">Yokosuka</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nagasaki,_Nagasaki" title="Nagasaki, Nagasaki" class="mw-redirect">Nagasaki</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Emperor_Meiji" title="Emperor Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a> abolished the samurai's right to be the only armed force in favor of a more modern, western-style, conscripted army in 1873. Samurai became <i>Shizoku</i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">士族</span>) who retained some of their salaries, but the right to wear a katana in public was eventually abolished along with the right to <a href="/wiki/Execute" title="Execute" class="mw-redirect">execute</a> commoners who paid them disrespect.</p>
<p>The samurai finally came to an end after hundreds of years of enjoyment of their status, their powers, and their ability to shape the government of Japan. However, the rule of the state by the military class was not yet over.</p>
<p>In defining how a modern Japan should be, members of the Meiji government decided to follow the footsteps of <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, basing the country on the concept of "<a href="/wiki/Noblesse_oblige" title="Noblesse oblige">noblesse oblige</a>."

<p>With the <a href="/wiki/Meiji_Restoration" title="Meiji Restoration">Meiji</a> reforms in the late 19th century, the samurai class was abolished, and a western-style national army was established. The Imperial Japanese Armies were conscripted, but many samurai volunteered to be soldiers and many advanced to be trained as officers. Much of the Imperial Army officer class was of samurai origin and they were highly motivated, disciplined and exceptionally trained.</p>

<p>Samurai were many of the early exchange students, not directly because they were samurai, but because many samurai were literate and well-educated scholars.

Adams also received the title of <i><a href="/wiki/Hatamoto" title="Hatamoto">hatamoto</a></i> (bannerman), a high-prestige position as a direct retainer in the Shogun's court. He was provided with generous revenues: "For the services that I have done and do daily, being employed in the Emperor's service, the emperor has given me a living" (Letters).

<p>As <i>de facto</i> aristocrats for centuries, samurai developed their own cultures that influenced Japanese culture as a whole. The culture associated with the samurai such as the tea ceremony, monochrome ink painting, rock gardens and poetry were adopted by warrior patrons throughout the centuries 1200-1600. These practices were adapted from the Chinese arts. Zen monks introduced then to Japan and they were allowed to flourish due to the interest of powerful warrior elites. Muso Soseki (1275-1351) was a Zen monk who was advisor to both Emperor Go-Daigo and General Ashikaga Takauji (1304-58). Muso as well as other monks acted as political and cultural diplomats between Japan and China. Muso was particularly well known for his garden design.Another Ashikaga patron of the arts was Yoshimasa. His cultural advisor, the Zen monk Zeami, introduced tea ceremony to him. Previously, tea had been used primarily for Buddhist monks to stay awake during meditation. <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In general, samurai, aristocrats, and priests had a very high literacy rate in Kanji. Recent studies have shown that literacy in Kanji among other groups in society was somewhat higher than previously understood. For example, court documents, birth and death records and marriage records from the Kamakura period, submitted by farmers, was prepared in Kanji. Both the Kanji literacy rate and skills in math both improved toward the end of Kamakura period.<sup id="cite_ref-Matsura_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Matsura-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Literacy was generally high among the warriors and the common classes as well. The feudal lord <a href="/wiki/Asakura_Norikage" title="Asakura Norikage">Asakura Norikage</a> (1474-1555 A.D.) noted the great loyalty given to his father, due to his polite letters, not just to fellow samurai, but also to the farmers and townspeople:</p>
<p>"There were to Lord Eirin's character many high points diffi­cult to measure, but according to the elders the foremost of these was the way he governed the province by his civility. It goes without saying that he acted this way toward those in the samurai class, but he was also polite in writing letters to the farmers and townspeople, and even in addressing these letters he was gracious beyond normal practice. In this way, all were willing to sacrifice their lives for him and become his allies."<sup id="cite_ref-Wilson_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wilson-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In a letter dated 29 January 1552, <a href="/wiki/St_Francis_Xavier" title="St Francis Xavier" class="mw-redirect">St Francis Xavier</a> observed the ease of which the Japanese understood prayers due to the high level of literacy in Japan at that time:</p>
<p>"There are two kinds of writing in Japan, one used by men and the other by women; and for the most part both men and women, especially of the nobility and the commercial class, have a literary education. The bonzes, or bonzesses, in their monasteries teach letters to the girls and boys, though rich and noble persons entrust the education of their children to private tutors.” "Most of them can read, and this is a great help to them for the easy understanding of our usual prayers and the chief points of our holy religion"<sup id="cite_ref-Coleridge_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Coleridge-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In a letter to Father Ignatius Loyola at Rome, Xavier further noted the education of the upper classes:</p>
<p>“The Nobles send their sons to monasteries to be educated as soon as they are 8 years old, and they remain there until they are 19 or 20, learning reading, writing and religion; as soon as they come out, they marry and apply themselves to politics."</p>
<p>"They are discreet, magnanimous and lovers of virtue and letters, honouring learned men very much"</p>
<p>In a letter dated November 11, 1549, Xavier described a multi-tiered educational system in Japan consisting of "universities", "colleges", "academies" and hundreds of monasteries which served as a principle center for learning by the populace:</p>
<p>"But now we must give you an account of our stay at Cagoxima. We put into that port because the wind was adverse to our sailing to Meaco, which is the largest city in Japan, and most famous as the residence of the King and the Princes. It is said that after four months are passed the favourable season for a voyage to Meaco will return, and then with the good help of God we shall sail thither. The distance from Cagoxima is three hundred leagues. We hear wonderful stories about the size of Meaco&#160;: they say that it consists of more than ninety thousand dwellings. There is a very famous University there, as well as five chief colleges of students, and more than two hundred monasteries of bonzes, and of others who are like coenobites, called Legioxi, as well as of women of the same kind, who are called Hamacutis. Besides this of Meaco, there are in Japan five other principal academies, at Coya, at Negu, at Fisso, and at Homia. These are situated round Meaco, with short distances between them, and each is frequented by about three thousand five hundred scholars. Besides these there is the Academy at Bandou, much the largest and most famous in all Japan, and at a great distance from Meaco. Bandou is a large territory, ruled by six minor princes, one of whom is more powerful than the others and is obeyed by them, being himself subject to the King of Japan, who is called the Great King of Meaco. The things that are given out as to the greatness and celebrity of these universities and cities are so wonderful as to make us think of seeing them first with our own eyes and ascertaining the truth, and then when we have discovered and know how things really are, of writing an account of them to you. 10 They say that there are several lesser academies besides those which we have mentioned"</p>

<p><i><a href="/wiki/Shudo" title="Shudo" class="mw-redirect">Shudō</a></i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">衆道</span>), the tradition of love bonds between a seasoned and a novice samurai was held to be "the flower of the samurai spirit" and formed the real basis of the samurai aesthetic. It was analogous to the educational <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <a href="/wiki/Pederasty" title="Pederasty">pederasty</a> and an honored and important practice in samurai society.

<p>Another name for the bonds was <i>bidō</i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">美道</span> "the beautiful way"). The devotion that two samurai would have for each other would be almost as great as that which they had for their <a href="/wiki/Daimyo" title="Daimyo">daimyo</a>. Indeed, according to contemporary accounts, the choice between his lover and his master could become a philosophical problem for samurai. <a href="/wiki/Hagakure" title="Hagakure">Hagakure</a> and other samurai manuals gave specific instructions in the way that this tradition was to be carried out and respected. After the <a href="/wiki/Meiji_Restoration" title="Meiji Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a> and the introduction of a more westernised lifestyle, the practice died out.</p>
<p>The bonds of shudo may not have been as widely practiced or as universally praised as some documents suggest.

<p>A samurai was usually named by combining one <a href="/wiki/Kanji" title="Kanji">kanji</a> from his father or grandfather and one new kanji. Samurai normally used only a small part of their total name.</p>
<p>For example, the full name of <a href="/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga" title="Oda Nobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> would be "Oda Kazusanosuke Saburo Nobunaga" (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">織田上総介三郎信長</span>), in which "Oda" is a clan or family name, "Kazusanosuke" is a title of vice-governor of Kazusa province, "Saburo" is a name before <i>genpuku</i>, a coming of age ceremony, and "Nobunaga" is an adult name. Samurai were able to choose their own first names.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marriage</a> of samurai was done by having a marriage arranged by someone with the same or higher rank than those being married. While for those samurai in the upper ranks this was a necessity (as most had few opportunities to meet a female), this was a <a href="/wiki/Formality" title="Formality">formality</a> for lower ranked samurai. Most samurai married women from a samurai family, but for a lower ranked samurai marriages with commoners were permitted. In these marriages a <a href="/wiki/Dowry" title="Dowry">dowry</a> was brought by the woman and was used to start their new lives.</p>
<p>A samurai could have a <a href="/wiki/Mistress_(lover)" title="Mistress (lover)">mistress</a> but her background was strictly checked by higher ranked samurai. In many cases, this was treated like a marriage. "Kidnapping" a mistress, although common in fiction, would have been shameful, if not a crime. When she was a commoner, a messenger would be sent with betrothal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parent's acceptance and many parents gladly accepted. If a samurai's wife gave birth to a son he could be a samurai.</p>
<p>A samurai could <a href="/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorce</a> his wife for a variety of reasons with approval from a superior, but divorce was, while not entirely nonexistent, a rare event. A reason for divorce would be if she could not produce a son, but then <a href="/wiki/Adoption" title="Adoption">adoption</a> could be arranged as an alternative to divorce. A samurai could divorce for personal reasons, even if he simply did not like his wife, but this was generally avoided as it would embarrass the samurai who had arranged the marriage. A woman could also arrange a divorce, although it would generally take the form of the samurai divorcing her. After a divorce samurai had to return the betrothal money, which often prevented divorces. Some rich merchants had their daughters marry samurai to erase a samurai's debt and advance their positions.</p>
<p>A samurai's wife would be dishonored and allowed to commit <a href="/wiki/Jigai" title="Jigai">jigai</a> (a female's <a href="/wiki/Seppuku" title="Seppuku">seppuku</a>) if she were cast off.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

The Buddhist concept of <a href="/wiki/Reincarnation" title="Reincarnation">reincarnation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rebirth" title="Rebirth">rebirth</a> led samurai to abandon torture and needless killing, while some samurai even gave up violence altogether and became Buddhist monks after realizing how fruitless their killings were.

I really think that among barbarous nations there can be none that has more natural goodness than the Japanese. They are of a kindly disposition, not at all given to cheating, wonderfully desirous of honour and rank. Honour with them is placed above everything else. There are a great many poor among them, but poverty is not a disgrace to any one. There is one thing among them of which I hardly know whether it is practised anywhere among Christians.

<p>Maintaining the household was the main duty of samurai women. This was especially crucial during early feudal Japan, when warrior husbands were often traveling abroad or engaged in clan battles. The wife, or <i>okusan</i> (meaning: one who remains in the home), was left to manage all household affairs, care for the children, and perhaps even defend the home forcibly. For this reason, many women of the samurai class were trained in wielding a polearm called a <a href="/wiki/Naginata" title="Naginata">naginata</a> or a special knife called the <i><a href="/wiki/Kaiken_(dagger)" title="Kaiken (dagger)">kaiken</a></i> in an art called <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Tant%C5%8Djutsu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tantōjutsu (page does not exist)">tantōjutsu</a></i> (lit. the skill of the knife), which they could use to protect their household, family, and honor if the need arose.</p>
<p>Traits valued in women of the samurai class were humility, obedience, self-control, strength, and loyalty. Ideally, a samurai wife would be skilled at managing property, keeping records, dealing with financial matters, educating the children (and perhaps servants, too), and caring for elderly parents or in-laws that may be living under her roof. Confucian law, which helped define personal relationships and the code of ethics of the warrior class required that a woman show subservience to her husband , filial piety to her parents, and care to the children. Too much love and affection was also said to indulge and spoil the youngsters. Thus, a woman was also to exercise discipline.</p>
<p>Though women of wealthier samurai families enjoyed perks of their elevated position in society, such as avoiding the physical labor that those of lower classes often engaged in, they were still viewed as far beneath men. Women were prohibited from engaging in any political affairs and were usually not the heads of their household.</p>
<p>This does not mean that samurai women were always powerless. Powerful women both wisely and unwisely wielded power at various occasions. After <a href="/wiki/Ashikaga_Yoshimasa" title="Ashikaga Yoshimasa">Ashikaga Yoshimasa</a>, 8th shogun of the Muromachi shogunate lost interest in politics, his wife Hino Tomiko largely ruled in his place. Nene, wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was known to overrule her husband's decisions at times and Yodo, his mistress, became the de facto master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's death. Chiyo, wife of Yamauchi Kazutoyo, has long been considered the ideal samurai wife. According to legend, she made her kimono out of a quilted patchwork of bits of old cloth and saved pennies to buy her husband a magnificent horse on which he rode to many victories. The fact that Chiyo (though she is better known as "Wife of Yamauchi Kazutoyo") is held to such high esteem for her economic sense is illuminating in the light of the fact that she never produced an heir and the Yamauchi clan was succeeded by Kazutoyo's younger brother. The source of power for women may have been that samurai looked down upon matters concerning money and left their finances to their wives.</p>
<p>As the Tokugawa period progressed more value became placed on education, and the education of females beginning at a young age became important to families and society as a whole. Marriage criteria began to weigh intelligence and education as desirable attributes in a wife, right along with physical attractiveness. Though many of the texts written for women during the Tokugawa period only pertained to how a woman could become a successful wife and household manager, there were those that undertook the challenge of learning to read, and also tackled philosophical and literary classics. Nearly all women of the samurai class were literate by the end of the Tokugawa period.</p>

<p>The samurai used various weapons, but the <i><a href="/wiki/Katana" title="Katana">katana</a></i> is the weapon that has come to be synonymous with samurai, metaphorically speaking. <a href="/wiki/Bushido" title="Bushido" class="mw-redirect">Bushido</a> teaches that the katana is the samurai's soul and sometimes a samurai is pictured as entirely dependent on the katana for fighting. They believe that the katana was so precious that they often gave them names and considered them as part of the living. However the use of swords did not become common in battle until the <a href="/wiki/Kamakura_period" title="Kamakura period">Kamakura period</a> (1185–1333), when the <i><a href="/wiki/Tachi" title="Tachi">tachi</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Uchigatana" title="Uchigatana">uchigatana</a></i> (the predecessor to the katana) became prevalent. The katana itself did not become the primary weapon until the <a href="/wiki/Edo_period" title="Edo period">Edo period</a>.</p>
<p>After a male <i>bushi</i> child was born, he would receive his first sword in a ceremony called <i>mamori-gatana</i>.

Upon reaching the age of thirteen, in a ceremony called <i>genpuku</i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">元服</span>), a male child was given his first real swords and armour, an adult name, and became a samurai. A katana and a <i>wakizashi</i> together are called a <i><a href="/wiki/Daish%C5%8D" title="Daishō">daishō</a></i> (lit. "big and small").</p>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Wakizashi" title="Wakizashi">wakizashi</a></i> itself was a samurai's "honour blade" and purportedly never left the samurai's side. He would sleep with it under his pillow and it would be taken with him when he entered a house and had to leave his main weapons outside.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/Tant%C5%8D" title="Tantō">tantō</a></i> was a small dagger sometimes worn with or instead of the <i>wakizashi</i> in a <i>daishō</i>.

<p>In the 15th century, the <i><a href="/wiki/Yari" title="Yari">yari</a></i> (spear) also became a popular weapon. It displaced the <i><a href="/wiki/Naginata" title="Naginata">naginata</a></i> from the battlefield as personal bravery became less of a factor and battles became more organized around massed, inexpensive foot troops (<i><a href="/wiki/Ashigaru" title="Ashigaru">ashigaru</a></i>). A charge, mounted or dismounted, was also more effective when using a spear than a sword and it offered better than even odds against a samurai using a sword.

<p>The later half of the 16th century saw the introduction of the <i>teppō</i> or <a href="/wiki/Arquebus" title="Arquebus">arquebus</a> in Japan through Portuguese trade, enabling warlords to raise effective armies from masses of peasants. The new weapons were highly controversial. Their ease of use and deadly effectiveness was perceived by many samurai as a dishonorable affront to tradition. <a href="/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga" title="Oda Nobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> made deadly use of the <i>teppō</i> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Nagashino" title="Battle of Nagashino">Battle of Nagashino</a> in 1575, leading to the end of the <a href="/wiki/Takeda_clan" title="Takeda clan">Takeda clan</a>.</p>

<p>After their initial introduction by the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Empire" title="Portuguese Empire">Portuguese</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company" title="Dutch East India Company">Dutch</a>, the <i>teppō</i> were produced on a large scale by Japanese gunsmiths. By the end of the 16th century, there were more firearms in Japan than in any European nation. <i>Teppō</i>, employed <i>en masse</i>, largely by <i>ashigaru</i> peasant foot troops, were in many ways the antithesis of samurai valor. With the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate and an end to civil war, production of the guns declined sharply with prohibitions to ownership. By the Tokugawa period most spear-based weapons had been phased out partly because they were suboptimal for the close-quarter combat common at the time; this combined with the aforementioned restrictions on firearms resulted in the <i>daishō</i> being the only weapons typically carried by samurai.</p>
<p>In the 1570s cannons became a common part of the samurai's armoury. They often were mounted in castles or on ships, being used more as anti-personnel weapons than against castle walls or the like, though in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Nagashino" title="Siege of Nagashino" class="mw-redirect">siege of Nagashino castle</a> (1575) a cannon was used to good effect against an enemy siegetower. The first popular cannon in Japan were swivel-breech loaders nicknamed <i>kunikuzushi</i> or "province destroyers". <i>Kunikuzushi</i> weighed 264&#160;lb (120&#160;kg). and used 40&#160;lb (18&#160;kg). chambers, firing a small shot of 10 oz. The <a href="/wiki/Arima_clan" title="Arima clan">Arima clan</a> of Kyushu used guns like this at the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Okinawate&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Battle of Okinawate (page does not exist)">battle of Okinawate</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Ry%C5%ABz%C5%8Dji_clan" title="Ryūzōji clan">Ryūzōji clan</a>. By the time of the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Osaka" title="Siege of Osaka">Osaka campaign</a> (1614-1615), cannon technology had improved in Japan to the point where at Osaka, <a href="/wiki/Ii_Naotaka" title="Ii Naotaka">Ii Naotaka</a> managed to fire an 18&#160;lb (8.2&#160;kg). shot into the castle's keep.</p>

Kanji for Samurai</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Term <i>samurai</i> originally meant "those who serve in close attendance to nobility", and was written in the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_character" title="Chinese character">Chinese character</a> (or <i><a href="/wiki/Kanji" title="Kanji">kanji</a></i>) that had the same meaning. In Japanese, it was originally pronounced in the pre-<a href="/wiki/Heian_Period" title="Heian Period" class="mw-redirect">Heian period</a> as <i>saburau</i> and later as <i>saburai</i>, then <i>samurai</i> in the Edo period. In Japanese literature, there is an early reference to samurai in the <a href="/wiki/Kokin_Wakash%C5%AB" title="Kokin Wakashū">Kokinshū</a> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">古今集</span>, early 10th century):</p>

<p>The word <i><b>bushi</b></i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">武士</span>, lit. "warrior or armsman") first appears in an early history of Japan called <i><a href="/wiki/Shoku_Nihongi" title="Shoku Nihongi">Shoku Nihongi</a></i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">続日本記</span>, 797 A.D.). In a portion of the book covering the year 723 A.D., <i>Shoku Nihongi</i> states: "Literary men and Warriors are they whom the nation values". The term <i>bushi</i> is of <a href="/wiki/Chinese_language" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> origin and adds to the indigenous Japanese words for <i>warrior</i>: <i>tsuwamono</i> and <i>mononofu</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bushi</i> was the name given to the ancient Japanese soldiers from traditional warrior families. The <i>bushi</i> class was developed mainly in the north of Japan. They formed powerful clans, which in the 12th Century were against the noble families who were grouping themselves to support the imperial family who lived in Kyoto. Samurai was a word used by the <a href="/wiki/Kuge" title="Kuge">Kuge</a> aristocratic class with warriors themselves preferring the word <i>bushi</i>. The term <i><a href="/wiki/Bushid%C5%8D" title="Bushidō">Bushidō</a></i>, the "way of the warrior," is derived from this term and the mansion of a warrior was called <i>bukeyashiki</i>.</p>
<p>The terms <i>bushi</i> and <i>samurai</i> became synonymous near the end of the 12th century, according to <a href="/wiki/William_Scott_Wilson" title="William Scott Wilson">William Scott Wilson</a> in his book <i>Ideals of the Samurai—Writings of Japanese Warriors</i>. Wilson's book thoroughly explores the origins of the word <i>warrior</i> in Japanese history as well as the <i>kanji</i> used to represent the word.</p>
<p>"Breaking down the character bu (武) reveals the radical (止), meaning "to stop," and an abbreviation of the radical (戈 ) "spear." The Shuo Wen, an early Chinese dictionary, gives this definition: "Bu consists of subduing the weapon and therefore stopping the spear." The Tso Chuan, another early Chinese source, goes further:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Bu consists of bun (文): literature or letters, and generally the arts of peace) stopping the&#160;:spear. Bu prohibits violence and subdues weapons ... it puts the people at peace, and harmonizes&#160;:the masses.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The radical shi (±) on the other hand seems to have originally meant a person who performs some function or who has the ability in some field. Early in Chinese history it came to define the upper class of society, and in the Book of Han this definition is given&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The shi, the farmer, the craftsman, and the tradesman are the four professions of the people. He&#160;:who occupies his rank by means of learning is called a shi.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Wilson states that the shi, as the highest of the four classes, brandished the weapons as well as the books. <i>bushi</i> therefore translates as "a man who has the ability to keep the peace, either by literary or military means, but predominantly by the latter".</p>
<p>It was not until the early modern period, namely the <a href="/wiki/Azuchi-Momoyama_period" title="Azuchi-Momoyama period">Azuchi-Momoyama period</a> and early <a href="/wiki/Edo_period" title="Edo period">Edo period</a> of the late 16th and early 17th centuries that the word <i>saburai</i> was replaced with <i>samurai</i>. However, the meaning had changed long before that.</p>

<p>During the era of the rule of the samurai, the term <i>yumitori</i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">弓取</span>, "bowman") was also used as an honorary title of an accomplished warrior even though swordsmanship had become more important. (Japanese archery (<i><a href="/wiki/Kyujutsu" title="Kyujutsu" class="mw-redirect">kyujutsu</a></i>) is still strongly associated with the war god <a href="/wiki/Hachiman" title="Hachiman">Hachiman</a>.)</p>
<p>A samurai with no attachment to a clan or <i><a href="/wiki/Daimyo" title="Daimyo">daimyo</a></i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">大名</span>) was called a <i><a href="/wiki/Ronin" title="Ronin">ronin</a></i> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">浪人</span>). In Japanese, the word <i>ronin</i> means "wave man", a person destined to wander aimlessly forever, like the waves in the sea. The word came to mean a samurai who was no longer in the service of a lord because his lord had died, because the samurai had been banished or simply because the samurai chose to become a ronin.</p>
<p>The pay of samurai was measured in <i>koku</i> of rice (180 liters; enough to feed a man for one year). Samurai in the service of the <a href="/wiki/Han_(feudal_domain)" title="Han (feudal domain)" class="mw-redirect"><i>han</i></a> are called <i>hanshi</i>.</p>

<p>Most samurai were bound by a code of <a href="/wiki/Honor" title="Honor" class="mw-redirect">honor</a> and were expected to set an example for those below them. A notable part of their code is <a href="/wiki/Seppuku" title="Seppuku">seppuku</a> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji"><span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">切腹</span></span> <span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span><i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">seppuku</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help noprint"><sup><a href="/wiki/Help:Japanese" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color: #00e; font: bold 80% sans-serif; text-decoration: none; padding: 0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span>, which allowed a disgraced samurai to regain his honor by passing into death, where samurai were still beholden to social rules. Whilst there are many romanticised characterisations of samurai behaviour such as the writing of <a href="/wiki/Bushido" title="Bushido" class="mw-redirect">Bushido</a> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji"><span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">武士道</span></span> <span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span><i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji">Bushidō</span></i><span class="t_nihongo_help noprint"><sup><a href="/wiki/Help:Japanese" title="Help:Japanese"><span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color: #00e; font: bold 80% sans-serif; text-decoration: none; padding: 0 .1em;">?</span></a></sup></span>)</span> in 1905, studies of <a href="/wiki/Kobudo" title="Kobudo" class="mw-redirect">Kobudo</a> and traditional <a href="/wiki/Budo" title="Budo" class="mw-redirect">Budo</a> indicate that the samurai were as practical on the battlefield as were any other warrior.</p>
<p>Despite the rampant romanticism of the 20th century, samurai could be disloyal and treacherous (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Akechi_Mitsuhide" title="Akechi Mitsuhide">Akechi Mitsuhide</a>), cowardly, brave, or overly loyal (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Kusunoki_Masashige" title="Kusunoki Masashige">Kusunoki Masashige</a>). Samurai were usually loyal to their immediate superiors, who in turn allied themselves with higher lords. These loyalties to the higher lords often shifted; for example, the high lords allied under <a href="/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" title="Toyotomi Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> (<span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">豊臣秀吉</span>) were served by loyal samurai, but the <a href="/wiki/Feudal" title="Feudal" class="mw-redirect">feudal</a> lords under them could shift their support to <a href="/wiki/Tokugawa_clan" title="Tokugawa clan">Tokugawa</a>, taking their samurai with them.

This same distortion of samurai culture continues onto the low-budget world of the <a href="/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult film</a>, where in films such as <i><a href="/wiki/Samurai_Vampire_Bikers_From_Hell" title="Samurai Vampire Bikers From Hell">Samurai Vampire Bikers From Hell</a></i>, the primary characters attempt to portray a lineage to the samurai but are more closely linked to the <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> or <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" title="Comic book">comic book</a> culture of the late twentieth century.</p>
<p>The samurai have also appeared frequently in Japanese comics (<a href="/wiki/Manga" title="Manga">manga</a>) and animation (<a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a>). Most common are historical works where the protagonist is either a samurai or former samurai (or another rank/position) who possesses considerable martial skill. Two of the most famous examples are <i><a href="/wiki/Lone_Wolf_and_Cub" title="Lone Wolf and Cub">Lone Wolf and Cub</a></i>, where the former proxy executioner for the Shogun and his toddler son become hired killers after being betrayed by other samurai and nobles, and <i><a href="/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin" title="Rurouni Kenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></i>, where a former assassin, after helping end the Bakumatsu era and bringing about the Meiji era, finds himself protecting newfound friends and fighting off old enemies while upholding his oath to never kill again through the use of a reverse-bladed sword.</p>
<p>Samurai-like characters are not just restricted to historical settings and a number of works set in the modern age, and even the future, include characters who live, train and fight like samurai. Notable examples include <a href="/wiki/Goemon_Ishikawa_XIII" title="Goemon Ishikawa XIII">Goemon Ishikawa XIII</a> from the <i><a href="/wiki/Lupin_III" title="Lupin III">Lupin III</a></i> series of comics, television series, and movies, and Motoko Aoyama from the romantic comedy <i><a href="/wiki/Love_Hina" title="Love Hina">Love Hina</a></i>. Another more western movie is <a href="/wiki/The_Hunted_(1995_film)" title="The Hunted (1995 film)">The Hunted (1995)</a>, where a surviving samurai clan protects a witness from evil ninjas. Some relevance to the samurai can even be seen in the show <i><a href="/wiki/Beyblade" title="Beyblade">Beyblade</a></i>, which is set in the present. One character, Jin of the Gale, seems to be a mix of samurai and ninja traits. Another <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> involving samurai, which is intended for adult audiences, is 2004's <i><a href="/wiki/Samurai_Champloo" title="Samurai Champloo">Samurai Champloo</a></i>, which portrays Edo-period Japan combined with modern street-culture and <i><a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_culture" title="Hip hop culture" class="mw-redirect">hip-hop</a></i>. One of the show's main characters is Jin, once an accomplished samurai who became a wandering ronin after killing his master.</p>
<p>American <a href="/wiki/Comic_books" title="Comic books" class="mw-redirect">comic books</a> have adopted the character type for stories of their own. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Universe" title="Marvel Universe">Marvel Universe</a> <a href="/wiki/Superhero" title="Superhero">superhero</a> <a href="/wiki/Wolverine_(comics)" title="Wolverine (comics)">Wolverine</a> during the 1980s attempted to use the ideals and concept of the samurai as a means to control his violent urges in a constructive manner. The ronin have also been a feature in popular series such as <i><a href="/wiki/Ronin_(comic)" title="Ronin (comic)" class="mw-redirect">Ronin</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Frank_Miller_(comics)" title="Frank Miller (comics)">Frank Miller</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Usagi_Yojimbo" title="Usagi Yojimbo">Usagi Yojimbo</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Stan_Sakai" title="Stan Sakai">Stan Sakai</a>.</p>
<p>The concept of a samurai, as opposed to that of a <a href="/wiki/Knight" title="Knight">knight</a>, has led to a major gap in how a <a href="/wiki/Warrior" title="Warrior">warrior</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Hero" title="Hero">hero</a> is characterized in Japan and the rest of the world. A samurai does not have to be tall and heavily muscled to be strong - he can be barely five feet tall, seemingly weak and even <a href="/wiki/Disability" title="Disability">handicapped</a>. Females can also be samurai. Equating size with power and strength does not readily appeal to the Japanese aesthetic. Perfect examples of this can be found in the <i><a href="/wiki/Zatoichi" title="Zatoichi">Blind Swordsman Zatoichi</a></i> movie series.</p>
<p>It is also important to note the uses of samurai in the Hip Hop music in both American and Japanese cultures. It is commonly seen as a tangent to the “gangtas” in rap music. Fusions of this are apparent in collaborations rap artists of both cultures and inclusion of anime. <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>What has been shown from the cases above is that samurai been recreated in various media. This “continued pattern of reshaping samurai to conform, not to history, but to the needs of the moment… each generation recast the samurai according to its own attitudes and agenda.”<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> This reimaging of the samurai is not restricted to modern media but all forms of media from any time. Samurais from various media share common elements, such as carrying a sword or behaving a certain way. This serves to help the audience identify image to the subject and even reinforce the image also.</p>

<p>A number of <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> films have used the image or culture of samurai, the most notable being the iconic science fiction character of <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> films, who is portrayed wearing a helmet and armor that are based on samurai helmets and armor.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> In <i>Star Wars</i>, the <a href="/wiki/Jedi" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> use similar methods of training from a young age like that of samurai.</p>

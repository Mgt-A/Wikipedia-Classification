<p>In <a href="/wiki/Film_production" title="Film production" class="mw-redirect">filmmaking</a>, <b>dubbing</b> or <b>looping</b> is the process of recording or replacing voices for a <a href="/wiki/Motion_picture" title="Motion picture" class="mw-redirect">motion picture</a>. The term most commonly refers to voices recorded that do not belong to the original actors and speak in a different language from the one in which the actor is speaking. "Dubbing" also describes the process of an actor re-recording lines they spoke during filming that must be replaced to improve audio quality or reflect dialog changes. This process is called <b>automated dialogue replacement</b>, or <b>ADR</b> for short. Music is also dubbed onto a film after editing is completed.</p>
<p>Foreign-language films, videos and sometimes video games are often dubbed into the local <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a> of their <a href="/wiki/Target_market" title="Target market">target markets</a> to increase their popularity with the local audience by making them more accessible. Dubbing is common both in theatrically released film and in <a href="/wiki/Television_series" title="Television series" class="mw-redirect">television series</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood" class="mw-redirect">Hollywood</a> series and serialized <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> that have received foreign distribution.</p>

<p><b>Automated dialogue replacement</b> or <b>Additional dialogue recording</b> (ADR) is a film sound technique involving the re-recording of dialogue after photography, also known as "looping" or a <b>looping session</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> it is called <b>post-synchronisation</b> or <b>post-sync</b>.</p>
<p>In conventional film production, a <a href="/wiki/Production_sound_mixer" title="Production sound mixer">production sound mixer</a> records dialogue during photography, but several uncontrollable issues, such as traffic or animal noise, during principal photography can cause the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Production_sound&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Production sound (page does not exist)">production sound</a> to be unusable. This is also true for <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">computer-generated imagery</a>, since some of the "actors" were not actually present at the set. In addition, ADR is also used to change the lines which the actor originally said while being filmed.</p>
<p>When the film is in post-production, a <a href="/wiki/Supervising_Sound_Editor" title="Supervising Sound Editor">Supervising Sound Editor</a> or <a href="/w/index.php?title=ADR_Supervisor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="ADR Supervisor (page does not exist)">ADR Supervisor</a> reviews all of the dialogue in the film and rules which actor lines will have to be replaced using the ADR technique.</p>
<p>ADR is recorded during an ADR session. An actor, usually the original actor on set, is called to a sound studio equipped with video playback equipment and sound playback and recording equipment. The actor wears headphones and is shown the line of the film that must be replaced, and often he or she will be played the production sound recording. The film is then projected several times, and the actor attempts to re-perform the line while watching the image on the screen, while an <a href="/w/index.php?title=ADR_Recordist&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="ADR Recordist (page does not exist)">ADR Recordist</a> records the performances. Several takes are made, and based on the quality of the performance and sync, one is selected and edited by an <a href="/w/index.php?title=ADR_Editor&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="ADR Editor (page does not exist)">ADR Editor</a> for use in the film.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a different actor is used from the actual actor on set. One famous example is the <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> character <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/David_Prowse" title="David Prowse">David Prowse</a> and later <a href="/wiki/Hayden_Christensen" title="Hayden Christensen">Hayden Christensen</a>. In postproduction, <a href="/wiki/James_Earl_Jones" title="James Earl Jones">James Earl Jones</a> always dubbed the character's voice. Many fans therefore think of Jones as "the man who played Darth Vader" rather than the actors who wore the suit on set.</p>
<p>There are variations of the ADR process. ADR does not have to be recorded in a studio, but can be recorded on location, with mobile equipment; this process was pioneered by <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Wood_(sound_editor)" title="Matthew Wood (sound editor)">Matthew Wood</a> of <a href="/wiki/Skywalker_Sound" title="Skywalker Sound">Skywalker Sound</a> for <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" title="Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace">Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></i>. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but only by having him listen to the performance. This process was used for years at <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a>.</p>
<p>An alternative method, called "rythmo band” (or "lip-sync band") was historically used in Canada and France. This band provides a more precise guide for the actors, directors and technicians and can be used to complement the traditional headphone method. The band is actually a clear 35 mm film leader on which is written, in <a href="/wiki/India_ink" title="India ink">India ink</a>, the dialogue and numerous indications for the actor (laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, mouth openings and closings, etc.). The lip-sync band is projected in studio and scrolls in perfect synchronization with the picture. Thanks to the high efficiency of the lip-sync band, the number of retakes are reduced, resulting in a substantial savings in recording time (as much as 50% compared to headphones-only recording).</p>
<p>Historically, the preparation of the lip-sync band is a long, tedious and complex process involving a series of specialists in an old fashioned manual production line. Until recently, such constraints have prevented this technique from being adopted internationally, particularly in the United States.</p>
<p>Advanced software technology has been able to digitally reproduce the rythmo-band output in a fraction of the time. This technology is being adapted in all markets and is proven to reduce the amount of studio time and number of takes required for actors to achieve accurate synchronization.</p>
<p>Using the traditional ADR technique (headphones and video) actors can average 10-12 lines per hour. Using the newer digital rythmo-band technologies, actors can output from 35-50 lines per hour, and much more with experience. Studio output with multiple actors can therefore reach two to four hundred lines per hour. dubStudio has pioneered the digital rythmo-band technology and has been used by several large dubbing studios.</p>
<p>ADR can usually be used to redub singing. This technique was used by, among many others, <a href="/wiki/Billy_Boyd_(actor)" title="Billy Boyd (actor)">Billy Boyd</a> and <a href="/wiki/Viggo_Mortensen" title="Viggo Mortensen">Viggo Mortensen</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings#The_Peter_Jackson_films" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>Dubbing is often used to <a href="/wiki/Localization" title="Localization">localize</a> a foreign movie. The new voice track will usually be spoken by a <a href="/wiki/Voice_artist" title="Voice artist" class="mw-redirect">voice artist</a>. In many countries, most actors who regularly perform this duty are generally little-known, outside of popular circles such as <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> fandom, for example, or when their voice has become synonymous with the role or the actor or actress whose voice they usually dub. In the United States, many of these actors also employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to <a href="/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> regulations or simple desire to dissociate themselves from the role. However, famous local actors can also be hired to perform the dubbing, particularly for comedies and animated movies, as their names are supposed to attract moviegoers, and the entire Hollywood cast is dubbed by a local cast of similar notoriety.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/North-West_Europe" title="North-West Europe">North-West Europe</a> – meaning the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scandinavia" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> – generally only movies and TV shows intended for children are dubbed, while all TV shows and movies for older audiences are subtitled (though animated productions in particular tend to be an exception). For children's movies in cinemas usually both a dubbed and a subtitled version is available.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>, the vast majority of foreign films are subtitled although some, mostly animated films and TV programmes, are dubbed in English. These usually originate from <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a> as opposed to being dubbed locally, although there have been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Monkey_(TV_series)" title="Monkey (TV series)">Monkey</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Magic_Roundabout" title="The Magic Roundabout">The Magic Roundabout</a></i>. When airing films on television, channels in the UK and Ireland will often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if an English dub already exists. It is also a fairly common practice that animation aimed at pre-school children is re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.</p>
<p>Some animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into <a href="/wiki/Welsh_language" title="Welsh language">Welsh</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic" title="Scottish Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a>. Similarly, in Ireland, animated series shown on <a href="/wiki/TG4" title="TG4">TG4</a> are shown dubbed in <a href="/wiki/Irish_language" title="Irish language">Irish</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Croatia" title="Croatia">Croatia</a> foreign films and TV series are always subtitled while some children programs and cartoons are dubbed into <a href="/wiki/Croatian_language" title="Croatian language">Croatian</a>. Recently more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception was poor. Regardless of language, Croatian audience prefers subtitling to dubbing. Some previously quite popular shows (e.g. <i><a href="/wiki/Sailor_Moon" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor Moon</a></i>) lost their appeal completely after dubbing started and were eventually taken off the program. The situation is similar with theatre movies with only those intended for children being dubbed (<i><a href="/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Shark_Tale" title="Shark Tale">Shark Tale</a></i>) but they are also regularly shown subtitled as well.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>, dubbing is exclusively used in young children's cartoons. Cartoon films and other films for children are usually released dubbed in Finnish, although many theaters also screen the original versions. For the 6% Swedish-speaking minority, the dubbed version from Sweden is also made available at certain cinemas, and later on video/DVD. In movie theaters the films have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in cursivated font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV-shows and movies were dubbed by one actor in Finland, as in Russian <a href="/wiki/Gavrilov_translation" title="Gavrilov translation">Gavrilov translation</a>. Later subtitles became a practice also in Finnish television. Dubbing is very unwanted in Finland, as with many other countries. A good example for this is <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons_Movie" title="The Simpsons Movie">The Simpsons Movie</a></i>. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish dubbed version got poor reviews, some critics even calling it a disaster.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, all films are released theatrically in their original versions and contain subtitles. Only cartoon films (e.g. <i><a href="/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Incredibles" title="The Incredibles">The Incredibles</a></i> etc.) are released in both original and dubbed versions, for children that cannot yet read fast or at all. Foreign TV shows are also shown in their original versions except for most cartoons. For example <i><a href="/wiki/The_Flintstones" title="The Flintstones">The Flintstones</a></i> is always dubbed, while <i><a href="/wiki/Family_Guy" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i> is subtitled and contains the original dialogue, since it is mostly for adults rather than children.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, only children's TV series are dubbed, and on Cable TV even children's series such as <a href="/wiki/Doraemon" title="Doraemon">Doraemon</a> are subtitled. Animated movies used to be dubbed in Brazilian Portugese for decades -<a href="/wiki/The_Lion_King" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a> was the first feature fim dubbed in Portugal. Recently, children's Live-Action movies (such as the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> series) have also been dubbed into Portuguese. While the quality of these dubs is recognised, usually original versions with subtitles are still preferred by the public and they get even distribution in cinemas (<a href="/wiki/Bee_Movie" title="Bee Movie">Bee Movie</a> is a good example of this). It is not common practice to dub animation for adults (such as <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> or <a href="/wiki/South_Park" title="South Park">South Park</a>). When <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons_Movie" title="The Simpsons Movie">The Simpsons Movie</a> was dubbed and the Portuguese version was largely distributed in cinemas, with some small cities not even getting the original version, there were protests from the public. Live action series and movies are <i>always</i> shown in the original language with subtitles.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>, virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in <a href="/wiki/Romanian_language" title="Romanian language">Romanian</a>, including cartoons on <a href="/wiki/Jetix_(Romania)" title="Jetix (Romania)" class="mw-redirect">Jetix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network_(Europe)" title="Cartoon Network (Europe)">Cartoon Network</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minimax_tv" title="Minimax tv" class="mw-redirect">Minimax</a> as well as those shown on generalist television networks, children-focused series like <i><a href="/wiki/Power_Rangers" title="Power Rangers">Power Rangers</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Addams_Family" title="The New Addams Family">The New Addams Family</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Planet%27s_Funniest_Animals" title="The Planet's Funniest Animals" class="mw-redirect">The Planet's Funniest Animals</a></i> or movies screened on children television. Animation movies are shown in theatres with Romanian dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version; that was the case of such movies like <i><a href="/wiki/Babe_(movie)" title="Babe (movie)" class="mw-redirect">Babe</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Atlantis:_The_Lost_Empire" title="Atlantis: The Lost Empire">Atlantis: The Lost Empire</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Cars_(movie)" title="Cars (movie)" class="mw-redirect">Cars</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Shrek_the_Third" title="Shrek the Third">Shrek the Third</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)" title="Ratatouille (film)">Ratatouille</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda" title="Kung Fu Panda">Kung Fu Panda</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/WALL-E" title="WALL-E">WALL-E</a></i>. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Usually subtitles are preferred in the Romanian market, except for children-intended programme: according to "Special Eurobarometer 243" of the European Commission (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles, rather than dubbed; nonetheless 22% prefer dubbing, while other 16% declined to answer.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> This is led by the missconception that watching movies in their original version is very efficient in learning foreign languages. However, only 7 percent of the respondents in that same survey claimed they learned a foreign language by doing so (EU average: 10 percent), compared to 69 percent that learned a foreign language during language lessons at school (EU average: 69 percent). Moreover, according to the Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method – watching movies in their original version – as the most efficient way of learning foreign languages, compared to 53 percent that chose language lessons at school.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Serbia" title="Serbia">Serbia</a> (and most other <a href="/wiki/Serbo-Croat" title="Serbo-Croat" class="mw-redirect">Serbo-Croat</a> speaking parts of former <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>), foreign films and TV series are always subtitled while children's movies and cartoons are dubbed into Serbo-Croat. The dubbing of cartoon classics during the 80s had a twist of its own: famous Belgrade actors provided the voices for Bugs, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Goofy, Donald Duck and other characters, frequently using region specific phrases and sentences and thus adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for tongue-in-cheek comments in specific situations. Even though these dubbed classics are seldom aired nowadays, younger generations continue to use these phrases without even knowing their true origin.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Slovenia" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, all foreign films and television programmes are subtitled without exceptions. Traditionally, children movies and animated cartoons used to be dubbed, but subtitling has gradually spread into that genre, as well. Nowadays, only movies for preschool children, who cannot read, remain dubbed.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a>, <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italian_language" title="Italian language">Italian-speaking</a> markets of Europe, virtually all foreign films and television shows are dubbed. There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions, and, even in the largest cities, there are virtually no cinemas that screen original versions with <a href="/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning)" title="Subtitle (captioning)">subtitles</a>, or no translation at all. However, digital <a href="/wiki/Pay-TV" title="Pay-TV" class="mw-redirect">pay-TV</a> programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original language films other than in the country's official language were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small niche markets such as intellectual or art films.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, movies and TV series are always released dubbed in French. Films are usually released theatrically in both dubbed and original versions in large cities main street theatres, and a theatre showing a subtitled movie typically has a sign on the poster advising the moviegoers the movie is in the original language version (usually abbreviated VO [<i>version originale</i>] or VOST [<i>version originale sous-titrée</i>] as opposed to VF [<i>version française</i>]). <a href="/wiki/Art_film" title="Art film">Art house movies</a> are often available in their original version only due to limited distribution. Some voice talents, such as <a href="/wiki/Roger_Carel" title="Roger Carel">Roger Carel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Richard_Darbois" title="Richard Darbois">Richard Darbois</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Edgar_Givry&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Edgar Givry (page does not exist)">Edgar Givry</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jacques_Frantz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jacques Frantz (page does not exist)">Jacques Frantz</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jacques_Balutin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jacques Balutin (page does not exist)">Jacques Balutin</a> or <a href="/w/index.php?title=Francis_Lax&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Francis Lax (page does not exist)">Francis Lax</a>, have achieved significant popularity.</p>
<p>The Germanophone dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign movie dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world. In <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a> and the German speaking part of <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, practically all films, shows, television series and foreign soap operas are shown in the dubbed versions created for the German market. Even computer games and video games feature German text menues and are dubbed into the German language if containing any speaking parts in the games. However, in recent years, Swiss-German television, SF1 and SF2 have been showing increasing numbers of movies in "dual sound" which means the viewer can choose between the original language (usually English) or German. In addition, Swiss-French television shows many broadcasts available in original language or French, as does Swiss-Italian television TSI. A common example is the American detective series Columbo and other popular series based broadcasts such as Starsky and Hutch.</p>
<p>Dubbing films has been and is still tradition and is common practice in Germany. Although voice actors play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognized for their <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a> voice and the German audience is used to them and so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions as <a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> has become more popular, especially among younger viewers. On German <a href="/wiki/TV" title="TV" class="mw-redirect">TV</a>, few movies are subtitled, although pay-per-view programming is often available in its original language.</p>
<p>German dubbed versions diverge sometimes far from the original, especially adding humorous elements to the original. In extreme cases, like <a href="/wiki/The_Persuaders!" title="The Persuaders!">The Persuaders!</a> the dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often it also adds sexually explicit gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use, like in <a href="/wiki/Bewitched_(film)" title="Bewitched (film)">Bewitched</a>, translating <i>The Do-not-disturb sign will hang at the door this night</i> to <i>The only hanging thing this night will be the Do-not-disturb sign</i>.</p>
<p>Some movies dubbed before <a href="/wiki/German_reunification" title="German reunification">reunification</a> exist in different versions for the east and the west. They use different translations, and often they are different in the style of dubbing.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> is the country where the use of dubbing is systematic, with a long tradition going back to the 1930s in <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="/wiki/Milan" title="Milan">Milan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Turin" title="Turin">Turin</a>. Back in Mussolini's fascist Italy, foreign languages were banned. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where they dub major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons. However in Milan it is mostly cartoons and some minor productions which are dubbed. Practically every American film, of every genere, whether for kids or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed in Italian. In big cities original version movies can also be seen. Subtitles are usually available on late night programmes on mainstream tv channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in English with Italian subtitles, and many shows feature the original English soundtrack. But for fans of dubbing, there are some little-known sites on the internet that offer the free streaming of movies with their Italian soundtrack. Early in his career, <a href="/wiki/Nino_Manfredi" title="Nino Manfredi">Nino Manfredi</a> worked extensively as a dubbing actor. Furthermore, common practice at one point in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes <a href="/wiki/MOS_(filmmaking)" title="MOS (filmmaking)">MOS</a> and dub the dialogue in post-production - a noticeable example being <i><a href="/wiki/The_Good,_The_Bad,_and_The_Ugly" title="The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" class="mw-redirect">The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</a></i>, wherein even the actors speaking English on screen had to dub in their own voices.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Latvia" title="Latvia">Latvia</a>, dubbing is hugely popular - almost all shows are dubbed.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Slovakia" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, virtually all foreign films and television programmes shown on television are dubbed, often by well-known actors. In Slovakia often the Czech dub is shown instead of producing a local one. Some auidences actively prefer the Czech dubs because they are felt to be of higher quality. In both countries dubbing actors often "overact" causing audiences to express views that American films are of low intellectual quality. In cinemas, films are usually shown subtitled, unless they are intended for children of 12 years of age and younger; Slovak law requires those films be dubbed or rated as MP-12 (roughly equivalent to <a href="/wiki/PG-13" title="PG-13" class="mw-redirect">PG-13</a>, without a cautionary meaning in this case.)<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. Cinemas sometimes offer both dubbed and subtitled screenings for either very major movie releases (e.g. the <a href="/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings_movie_trilogy" title="Lord of the Rings movie trilogy" class="mw-redirect">Lord of the Rings movie trilogy</a>) that would have otherwise not been dubbed, or conversely for children's films or family films that are expected to also attract mature viewers (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Shrek" title="Shrek">Shrek</a>) to maximize the potential audience.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>, practically all foreign television programmes are shown dubbed in <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, as are most films. Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices like <a href="/w/index.php?title=Constantino_Romero&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Constantino Romero (page does not exist)">Constantino Romero</a>, who dubs <a href="/wiki/Clint_Eastwood" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> and <a href="/wiki/Schwarzenegger" title="Schwarzenegger" class="mw-redirect">Schwarzenegger</a>'s <a href="/wiki/The_Terminator" title="The Terminator">Terminator</a> among others. The Spanish-language dubs created in Spain are rarely used in Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America and vice-versa, since the varieties are generally considered too different by the general audience. In addition, in those <a href="/wiki/Autonomous_Community" title="Autonomous Community" class="mw-redirect">Autonomous Communities</a> with their own <a href="/wiki/Languages_of_Spain" title="Languages of Spain">official language other than Spanish</a>, most films and TV programmes shown on local TV networks (and sometimes in cinemas) are dubbed into local languages, such as <a href="/wiki/Catalan_language" title="Catalan language">Catalan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Basque_language" title="Basque language">Basque</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Galician_language" title="Galician language">Galician</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Bulgaria" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, television series are dubbed. But most television channels in Bulgaria use subtitles for the action and drama movies. Only Diema channels dub all programmes.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, practically all television programmes are dubbed, and about 50 per cent of movies in theaters. In the socialist era, every one of them was dubbed in high quality with professional and mostly popular actors, and similarly to Germany, they generally added to the quality of the film. Great care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend their voice to the same character. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dub soundtracks for movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading in dubbing quality, which once became customary, cinema distributors brought back the habit of dubbing to cinemas for popular productions, presenting them with the quality varying from very poor to average. However, every single feature is presented with original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.</p>
<p>There is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original, and by the current technological standards outdated soundtrack, which either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack licence) is unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, who ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely. This was because they did not want to pay the licensees for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but a very poor subtitle.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, cinema releases are almost exclusively subtitled, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows, are usually shown with the original soundtrack kept, and translation spoken over by <a href="/wiki/Lector" title="Lector">lector</a> - it is almost exactly the same as the so-called <a href="/wiki/Gavrilov_translation" title="Gavrilov translation">Gavrilov translation</a> in Russia. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of animated and children's movies and shows, which are often dubbed both in cinema and TV releases. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of <a href="/wiki/Shrek" title="Shrek">Shrek</a>, which contained many references to local culture and Polish humor. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors. However, it seems that it's the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a>, most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either lector or dubbed Polish track.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a> television is generally dubbed with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed, however with the fall of the regime many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden or at least questionable under communist rule started flooding in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way, i.e. the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using most primitive equipment. The quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfered with the original voices, background sounds leaked into, translation was inaccurate and most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person and usually lacked intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. In modern <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a>, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices.</p>

<p>In Spanish-American countries, all foreign language programmes, films, cartoons and documentaries shown in free aired TV channels are dubbed into <a href="/wiki/Neutral_Spanish" title="Neutral Spanish" class="mw-redirect">Neutral Spanish</a>, while in cable and satellite pan-regional channels are both dubbed or subtitled. For theaters, only the films made for children are dubbed into <a href="/wiki/Neutral_Spanish" title="Neutral Spanish" class="mw-redirect">Neutral Spanish</a> (usually with Mexican pronunciation) and sometimes dubbed into local Spanish for major markets like Argentine ones.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, departing from the conventions of other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries, <a href="/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)" title="Blockbuster (entertainment)">Blockbuster</a> films are featured in all movie theaters with dubbing. In addition most of the cinema-theaters, primarily in big cities, offer to see the film in the original language with subtitles. The people who attend the screening of films in the original language are often people from middle and upper class backgrounds. These people tend to find dubbed films as terrible. Also most of the movies released in DVD have the feature of <a href="/wiki/Neutral_Spanish" title="Neutral Spanish" class="mw-redirect">Neutral Spanish</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Broadcast_television_systems" title="Broadcast television systems">broadcast TV</a> foreign programs are dubbed. For legislation, in movie theaters, the documentaries, animated and children movie are dubbed. In <a href="/wiki/Pay_TV" title="Pay TV" class="mw-redirect">Pay TV</a> most shows and movies are subtitled.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, foreign programmes are invariably dubbed into Portuguese in <a href="/wiki/Broadcast_television_systems" title="Broadcast television systems">broadcast TV</a>, with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are usually subtitled (only children movies have dubbed versions at cinemas). <a href="/wiki/Pay_TV" title="Pay TV" class="mw-redirect">Pay TV</a> commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies but <a href="/wiki/Subtitling" title="Subtitling" class="mw-redirect">subtitling</a> is predominant.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, most films and TV programmes in English are dubbed into <a href="/wiki/Quebec_French" title="Quebec French">Quebec French</a> (with an <a href="/wiki/Standard_French" title="Standard French">International French</a> accent for ease of comprehension and regional neutrality). Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, is made using the more widely-spoken <i><a href="/wiki/Joual" title="Joual">joual</a></i> variety of Quebec French. This has the advantage of making <a href="/wiki/Children" title="Children" class="mw-redirect">children</a>'s films and TV series comprehensible to younger audiences, but many <a href="/wiki/Bilingual" title="Bilingual" class="mw-redirect">bilingual</a> Québécois prefer subtitling since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English as well in certain theatres (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the <a href="/wiki/West_Island" title="West Island">West Island</a>), and in fact, some theatres, such as the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Scotiabank_Cinema_Montreal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Scotiabank Cinema Montreal (page does not exist)">Scotiabank Cinema Montreal</a>, show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a>, or on English language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.</p>
<p>Formerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France, and to this day some still are. Such a practice was criticized by former politician <a href="/wiki/Mario_Dumont" title="Mario Dumont">Mario Dumont</a> after he took his children to see the Parisian French dub of <i><a href="/wiki/Shrek_the_Third" title="Shrek the Third">Shrek the Third</a></i>, which Dumont found incomprehensible. After Dumont's complaints and a proposed bill, <i><a href="/wiki/Bee_Movie" title="Bee Movie">Bee Movie</a></i>, the following film from <a href="/wiki/DreamWorks_Animation" title="DreamWorks Animation">DreamWorks Animation</a>, was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France. <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>. In addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. <a href="/wiki/Lucasfilm" title="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a></i> series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 80s with no Québecois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions with altered character and object names, terms, etc. were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and "reversing" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> and most of Canada outside Quebec, dubbing is rare except for animations: televised Japanese <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> is almost always aired in its dubbed format regardless of its content or target age group, with the sole exceptions occurring either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when <a href="/wiki/Turner_Classic_Movies" title="Turner Classic Movies">Turner Classic Movies</a> aired several of <a href="/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki" title="Hayao Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English dubbed, except for a handful of series which have been heavily edited and/or <a href="/wiki/Americanized" title="Americanized" class="mw-redirect">Americanized</a>. Usually, <a href="/wiki/Tokusatsu" title="Tokusatsu">Tokusatsu</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daikaiju" title="Daikaiju" class="mw-redirect">daikaiju</a> films are dubbed when imported into the U.S.; the poor quality of the dubbing of these films has become the subject of much mockery.</p>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, foreign television programmes including English program and Chinese Mandarin program (mostly China &amp; Taiwan) are dubbed in <a href="/wiki/Yue_Chinese" title="Yue Chinese" class="mw-redirect">Cantonese</a>, while Japanese programs, including <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a>, are also dubbed in Cantonese. The only exception is the TVB drama, which is originally Cantonese, is dubbed to Mandarin for selling to China and Taiwan. But broadcast in Cantonese in Malaysia, Hong Kong and overseas.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Thailand" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, foreign television programmes are dubbed, but the original soundtrack is often simultaneously carried or "simulcast" on the radio.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, South American <a href="/wiki/Telenovela" title="Telenovela">telenovelas</a> are dubbed, while English language programmes are usually shown in the original language with <a href="/wiki/Indonesian_language" title="Indonesian language">Indonesian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Malay_language" title="Malay language">Malay</a> subtitles respectively. However, recently in Malaysia, this has changed and South American telenovelas now retain their original language, with Malay subtitles. Most but not all Korean and Japanese dramas are still dubbed in <a href="/wiki/Standard_Mandarin" title="Standard Mandarin">Mandarin</a> with Malay subtitles on terrestrial television channels. <a href="/wiki/Yue_Chinese" title="Yue Chinese" class="mw-redirect">Cantonese</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese" title="Mandarin Chinese">Mandarin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hindi_language" title="Hindi language" class="mw-redirect">Hindi</a> programmes are shown in original language all this while, usually with Malay subtitling (and in some cases, multilingual subtitling). Cartoons and anime are also dubbed as well, although English-language cartoons are normally not dubbed, and some anime do retain their original Japanese language.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Philippines" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, Japanese anime are dubbed in the local tongue, Tagalog. One network, which focuses on anime and tokusatsu shows, has all its foreign programs dubbed in Tagalog. Popular also in the Philippines are Chinese, Korean, and Mexican TV programs which are termed Chinovelas, Koreanovelas, and Mexicanovelas respectively, and all these are also dubbed. Unfortunately, a large number of these dubbed foreign shows suffer from poor dialogue-to-lip syncing - oftentimes the length of the characters' spoken dialogue is disproportionate to their lip movement, or the spoken dialogue doesn't match well with the lip movement. The awkward results are easily visible to the viewer, and becomes a significant detraction to the dub quality. The problem is also present in some Tagalog anime dubs but is far less prevalent. It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series to be dubbed by only a handful of voice talents. English language media usually isn't dubbed, because of the local language of English. Subtitling is usually only done for films shown in theaters, which translates non-English and non-Tagalog dialogue and on-screen text.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Mongolia" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, most television dubbing uses the same method as Russian, using only few voice actors, and the original language audible underneath. In movie theatres, foreign films are shown in their original language with <a href="/wiki/Mongolian_language" title="Mongolian language">Mongolian</a> subtitles underneath.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, where "foreign films" are synonymous with Hollywood films, dubbing is done mostly in <a href="/wiki/Hindi_language" title="Hindi language" class="mw-redirect">Hindi</a> which is the national language and a few regional languages like <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Telugu_language" title="Telugu language">Telugu</a>, the finished works are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English language originals being released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions where often the dubbed version collections are outstanding than original. The most recent dubbing of <i><a href="/wiki/Spider-Man_3" title="Spider-Man 3">Spider-Man 3</a></i> was also done in <a href="/wiki/Bhojpuri" title="Bhojpuri" class="mw-redirect">Bhojpuri</a> a language popular in northern India.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, almost 60% of population speak <a href="/wiki/Punjabi_language" title="Punjabi language">Punjabi</a> as their mother-tongue in country. Therefore Punjabi films make more business than <a href="/wiki/Urdu_language" title="Urdu language" class="mw-redirect">Urdu</a> films. The film companies produced Punjabi films and re-record all films in Urdu and released it as a "Double Version" film.</p>
<p>Also in <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, where "foreign films" are synonymous with Hollywood films, dubbing is done mostly in <a href="/wiki/Urdu_language" title="Urdu language" class="mw-redirect">Urdu</a> which is the national language, the finished works are released into the metros of all over the country.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, foreign-language films and programs are dubbed on television, usually with just one voice actor. Programs aimed at children might have multiple voice actors. Chinese-language series available on DVD or for rent are dubbed with multiple voice actors, done by overseas Vietnamese. Subtitling is rarely seen.</p>
<p>In multilingual <a href="/wiki/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, English language programmes on the free to air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay, while Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes are almost always are subtitled in English. <a href="/wiki/Dual_sound" title="Dual sound" class="mw-redirect">Dual sound</a> programs like Korean and Japanese dramas offer sound in original languages and subtitled or are Mandarin dubbed and subtitled.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, dubbing starts from 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in this country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, the dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and making them interested in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its culminant point during the 1960’s and 1970’s with inflow of American, European and Hindi movies. Most famous musicals of the time, such as <i>My fair lady</i> and <a href="/wiki/Sound_of_music" title="Sound of music" class="mw-redirect">Sound of music</a> were translated, adjusted and performed in <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Persian</a> by the voice talents. After the 1978’s Revolution, the dubbing industry has been on the downfall, with movies to be dubbed only for the state TV channels. During the recent years DVDs with <a href="/wiki/Persian_language" title="Persian language">Persian</a> subtitles have found a market among the educated societies, but most of the people still prefer Persian-spoken versions. Nowadays, <a href="http://www.irdub.com" class="external text" title="http://www.irdub.com" rel="nofollow">The Association of Tehran’s Young Voice Actors</a> is seeking to revive the national tradition of dubbing, by adding a local tinge to the original and making it more appealing to the public ( e.g. <a href="/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Incredibles" title="Incredibles" class="mw-redirect">Incredibles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horton_Hears_a_Who!_(film)" title="Horton Hears a Who!

<p>In <a href="/wiki/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown with French dubbing. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the colonization past of these countries and the widespread use of the French language (mainly among the intellectual elite) in addition to the marginalization of national languages (mainly <a href="/wiki/Arabic" title="Arabic" class="mw-redirect">Arabic</a> and other <a href="/wiki/Berber_languages" title="Berber languages">Berber languages</a>). Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages to avoid high costs compared to small local markets. Starting from the eighties, dubbed series and movies for children in <a href="/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic" title="Modern Standard Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. But it should be noted that dubbing is still imported and performed in other Arab Countries with strong tradition of dubbing and subtitling (mainly <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lebanon" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jordan" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>). The evolution of movies targeting the adult audience was different. After the satellite boom in the <a href="/wiki/Arab_World" title="Arab World">Arab World</a> and the emergence of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Pan-Arab_channels&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pan-Arab channels (page does not exist)">Pan-Arab channels</a>, the use of subtitles which was already popular in the Middle-East was received with a huge popularity among local viewers in Algeria and Morocco.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, theaters usually show French dubbed movies but the cinema attendance in the country for such movies is in a continuous degradation compared to Tunisian and Arab Movies. This decline can be traced to the huge popularity of free-to-air Pan-Arab movie channels offering mainly subtitled content and the government lesser efforts to limit piracy. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Tunisia_National_Television&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tunisia National Television (page does not exist)">Tunisia National Television</a> (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic which pushed it to broadcast only dubbed content (This restriction was lately obsoleted only for commercials). During the seventies and eighties, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. This move was received with a big success locally but was not able to compete with mainstream dubbing companies (especially in the Middle-East). In the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule and broadcast sometimes foreign content dubbed into French (excluding children content), although some of them, such as <a href="/w/index.php?title=Hannibal_TV&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hannibal TV (page does not exist)">Hannibal TV</a> started adopting subtitling in Arabic instead which was proved to be more popular than simply importing French dubbed content.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning)" title="Subtitle (captioning)">Subtitles</a> can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. In most <a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English-speaking</a> countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>, some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arabic_language" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> or <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a>. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace — sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same thing also applies to certain television shows in <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a>, where <a href="/wiki/Finnish_language" title="Finnish language">Finnish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Swedish_language" title="Swedish language">Swedish</a> are both official languages.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nordic_countries" title="Nordic countries">Nordic countries</a> and <a href="/wiki/Estonia" title="Estonia">Estonia</a>, films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children movies and programs are dubbed, such as the <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a></i> series, <i><a href="/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Shrek" title="Shrek">Shrek</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_(film)" title="Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></i> etc. Cinemas usually both show a dubbed version and one with subtitles of this kind of movies, with the subtitled version later in the evening.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> this has traditionally also been the case (at least for live-action material), but one terrestrial channel, <a href="/wiki/TVI_(Portugal)" title="TVI (Portugal)" class="mw-redirect">TVI</a>, dubs U.S. series like <i><a href="/wiki/Dawson%27s_Creek" title="Dawson's Creek">Dawson's Creek</a></i> into <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>. RTP also transmitted <i><a href="/wiki/Friends" title="Friends">Friends</a></i> in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.</p>
<p>On <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVDs</a> with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individuals' preferences; <a href="/wiki/Purist" title="Purist">purists</a> often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience) subtitling is more suitable because it is cheaper. For films for small children, who can not yet read, or not yet very fast, dubbing is necessary.</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible timeslots in their subtitled version.

<p>Dubbing is occasionally used on <a href="/wiki/Network_television" title="Network television" class="mw-redirect">network television</a> broadcasts of films which have dialogue that the network executives or <a href="/wiki/Censorship" title="Censorship">censors</a> have decided to replace; this is usually done to remove <a href="/wiki/Profanity" title="Profanity">profanity</a>. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty; instead, an actor with a similar voice is called in. The results are sometimes seamless, but in many cases the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue needs to be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the <i><a href="/wiki/Smokey_and_the_Bandit" title="Smokey and the Bandit">Smokey and the Bandit</a></i> and the <a href="/wiki/Die_Hard_series" title="Die Hard series"><i>Die Hard</i></a> film series as shown on broadcasters such as <a href="/wiki/TBS_(TV_network)" title="TBS (TV network)">TBS</a>. In the case of <i>Smokey and the Bandit,</i> extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on <a href="/wiki/ABC_Television" title="ABC Television">ABC Television</a> in 1978, especially for <a href="/wiki/Jackie_Gleason" title="Jackie Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a>'s character, <a href="/wiki/Buford_T._Justice" title="Buford T. Justice">Buford T. Justice</a>. The dubbing of his phrase "Sombitch" became the more palatable (and memorable) "Scum Bum," which became a catchphrase of the time.</p>
<p>Dubbing is commonly used in <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> television as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as animatronic puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (e.g., starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. <i><a href="/wiki/Stargate" title="Stargate">Stargate</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Farscape" title="Farscape">Farscape</a></i> are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.</p>
<p>Since some anime series contain some amount of profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network_(United_States)" title="Cartoon Network (United States)">Cartoon Network</a>, removing references to <a href="/wiki/Death" title="Death">death</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hell" title="Hell">hell</a> as well. Some companies will offer both an edited version and uncut version of the series on DVD, so there is also an edited script in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD, characters say things like "Blast!" "Darn!" in place of the original dialogue's profanity (<a href="/wiki/Bandai" title="Bandai">Bandai Entertainment's</a> English dub of <i><a href="/wiki/G_Gundam" title="G Gundam" class="mw-redirect">G Gundam</a></i> is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as "Bartender, more milk.").</p>
<p>Dubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows <a href="/wiki/The_Late_Show_(Australian_TV_series)#The_Olden_Days" title="The Late Show (Australian TV series)">The Olden Days</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Late_Show_(Australian_TV_series)#Bargearse" title="The Late Show (Australian TV series)">Bargearse</a>, redubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series respectively, and the Irish show <a href="/wiki/Soupy_Norman" title="Soupy Norman">Soupy Norman</a>, redubbed from <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierwsza_mi%C5%82o%C5%9B%C4%87" class="extiw" title="pl:Pierwsza miłość">a Polish soap opera</a>.</p>
<p>Dubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language; in some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voiceover. This often occurs in <a href="/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, where "lektories" or "lektors" read the translated dialogue into <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Polish_language" title="Polish language">Polish</a>. In Poland, a single person reads all parts of the performance, both male and female. However, it is almost exclusively done for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Though, as of recently, the amount of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for cartoons and children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for some film, it is shown in theaters (however, some films, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i>, are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions varying with the time of the show) as well as on TV (although some channels drop it and do standard one narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like <a href="/wiki/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, the voiceover technique is also used for theatrical releases.</p>
<p>In Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Gavrilov_translation" title="Gavrilov translation">Gavrilov translation</a>, and is generally found only in <a href="/wiki/Copyright_infringement" title="Copyright infringement">illegal copies</a> of films and on <a href="/wiki/Cable_television" title="Cable television">cable television</a>. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue (some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal so it is very rare now).</p>

<p>Dubbing has been criticized in several ways, particularly in countries where it is not common practice.</p>
<p>Those who dislike dubbing sometimes claim that it devalues films or TV programs, as original soundtracks are closer to what the director intended. The humorous effect of <a href="/wiki/Inspector_Clouseau" title="Inspector Clouseau">Inspector Clouseau</a>'s accent is, of course, entirely lost in the French dubbing. Some consider that the <a href="/wiki/Body_language" title="Body language">body language</a> of <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a> actors make their performances particularly ill-suited to dubbing, as foreign post-synchronization often destroys much of the original Italian language's feeling. Comedy performers such as <a href="/wiki/Peter_Sellers" title="Peter Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louis_de_Fun%C3%A8s" title="Louis de Funès">Louis de Funès</a>, <a href="/wiki/Steve_Martin" title="Steve Martin">Steve Martin</a> or <a href="/wiki/Roberto_Benigni" title="Roberto Benigni">Roberto Benigni</a> are considered to lose great part of their impact when dubbed into foreign languages, as the humorous effect resulting from the interaction between their voices and bodies is partially lost. Some feel that dubbing can make the film or program less authentic. For example, <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> officers in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">WWII</a> movies can be distracting to some if not speaking <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a>, while in the German-dubbed versions of these films, the contrast between Germans and speakers of other languages is lost. The best example here is from the <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> movies, where the German characters had to be dubbed by native Germans for the German release and for the later re-release of the movies for television and DVD, they kept the dubbed lines even for original soundtrack to make it more authentic.</p>
<p>Likewise, some claim it is distracting in English dubbed <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> when many characters speak in North American accents, which may not match their ethnicity and nationality or the time and setting of the story. Similarly, in dubbed versions the different accents of the protagonists which may be important to the story (for example in <i><a href="/wiki/Upstairs,_Downstairs" title="Upstairs, Downstairs">Upstairs, Downstairs</a></i>, portraying the lives of an upper-class London family and their servants in the early 20th century) can not always be adequately reproduced in certain languages. In addition, a significant part of actor's performance consists of their vocal inflections. Very often, memorable lines from popular films are frequently quoted, not for their substance, but for the way they were spoken; a good example is a famous sentence, uttered by <a href="/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, in the film <i><a href="/wiki/A_Few_Good_Men" title="A Few Good Men">A Few Good Men</a></i>, "You can't handle the truth!". For these reasons, some may feel they miss part of film's artistic value when watching a film dubbed into another language. Also, lip synchronization is normally lost when dubbing, even with quality dubbing between closely related languages. There are examples which have been reshot or reanimated to remedy this problem. The dubbing of many television series is often criticized: the French dubbing of <a href="/wiki/Dynasty_(TV_series)" title="Dynasty (TV series)">Dynasty</a> and many American <a href="/wiki/Soap_operas" title="Soap operas" class="mw-redirect">soap operas</a> was and still is considered especially poor and ill-synchronized, and in addition it sometimes appears as if it was filmed with the camera on a different setting.</p>
<p>Dubbing performers are occasionally known to take liberties with some works they do not hold in particular esteem, or consider <a href="/wiki/Exploitation_films" title="Exploitation films" class="mw-redirect">exploitation films</a>. The <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">French</a> dubbing of the anime <a href="/wiki/Fist_of_the_North_Star" title="Fist of the North Star">Fist of the North Star</a> is notorious, as the performers disliked the violence of the series so much that, after post-synchronizing a few episodes, they only agreed on continuing their work if they could turn the show into a spoof<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>. This resulted in episodes full of idiotic puns, absurd dialogue and extreme overacting by everybody. This dubbing has gathered a cult following in France for that precise reason, although many <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> fans consider it highly disrespectful to the original work.</p>
<p>Another example is the German dub of <a href="/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail" title="Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>. The people responsible for the dub deemed Monty Python's humour unsuitable for the German audience (which was disproven by the huge success of Monty Python in Germany up to the present day, the group having even produced a German-language TV show and actually speaking the language in it) and introduced a lot of awkward puns into the dialogue, whereby they often completely killed the original humour. However, this practice had been a success with <a href="/wiki/The_Persuaders!" title="The Persuaders!">The Persuaders!</a>, where <a href="/wiki/Tony_Curtis" title="Tony Curtis">Tony Curtis</a>' and <a href="/wiki/Roger_Moore" title="Roger Moore">Roger Moore</a>'s suddenly very humorous dialogue has generated a cult following in Germany, while the series was received not as well in its original country, England.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most notorious examples of this is all anime dubbed by <a href="/wiki/4Kids_Entertainment" title="4Kids Entertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a> in the U.S., such as <a href="/wiki/One_Piece" title="One Piece">One Piece</a>. Not only are the American voice actors ill-received with the anime fanbase, but many awkward puns are inserted, names and settings are changed, edits are made to make the show suitable for a younger audience, and some or all of the original music is changed. The dubs are popular with young children but almost universally disliked among anime fans.</p>
<p>Occasionally, dubbing teams can show some disregard for the meaning and setting of the movies, regardless of their perceived quality: the French version of <a href="/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_O.K._Corral_(1957_film)" title="Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957 film)">Gunfight at the O.K. Corral</a> renames <a href="/wiki/Wyatt_Earp" title="Wyatt Earp">Wyatt Earp</a> "<i>Edward Thorpe</i>", as Earp's name is somewhat difficult to pronounce in French; since Wyatt Earp was not the most familiar Old West figure to French audiences, the adaptators did not feel bound to give particular regard to the historical figure.</p>
<p>Defenders of dubbing maintain that subtitling interferes with the visual experience, as it obscures part of the picture. Some people also find that the act of reading itself is distracting, especially in pictures that rely on subtle motion: one would be too busy reading the subtitles to pay attention to what everyone is doing. Also, some viewers who understand both the original language and the language used in the subtitles say they find that it is confusing and distracting to mentally process the dialogues in both languages at the same time. In other cases, viewers may not consider subtitling (and alternate forms of translation) to be distracting or inadequate; rather, they simply chose to listen to dubbed versions as a matter of personal preference. These people sometimes argue that as long as dubbing does not prevent others from viewing programs in the language format that they chose, it finds its merit simply because there are people who enjoy dubbing. Another defense for dubbing is that it works better in action movies, in particular scenes involving special effects with occasional dialog, since subtitles distract from the action or effects.</p>
<p>In many European countries, Hollywood movies are regularly dubbed and some people maintain that a creative translation (not necessarily faithful to the original English words) can occasionally bring additional fun and depth to films. English-language series such as <a href="/wiki/The_Persuaders!" title="The Persuaders!">The Persuaders!</a> and <a href="/wiki/Starsky_and_Hutch" title="Starsky and Hutch">Starsky and Hutch</a> are greatly popular in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> for their talented dubbing. The French version of "The Persuaders!" was in fact a translation of the German version instead of the English original - and was also successful. A German fan has asserted that the German dubbing was "a unique mixture of streetslang (sic) and ironic tongue-in-cheek remarks" and that it "even mentioned Lord Sinclair becoming 007 at one or two occasions".[19] It also frequently included remarks about the series itself like "Junge, lass doch die Sprüche, die setzen ja die nächste Folge ab!" (Stop those jokes, or they'll cancel the series) or about the dubbing: "Du musst jetzt etwas schneller werden, sonst bist Du nicht synchron" (Talk faster, or you aren't in sync any more).</p>
<p>In <a href="/wiki/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> it is common for translators to create the <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_language" title="Hungarian language">Hungarian</a> text to rhyme for comedies and cartoons with well-known local actors providing their voices to read it. The most famous example is perhaps the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Flintstones" title="The Flintstones">The Flintstones</a></i>, with its entire Hungarian text in rhymes.</p>
<p>In many cases, dubbing of films or series involves the addition of dialogue where there previously was none. This often happened during the dubbing of <a href="/wiki/Anime" title="Anime">anime</a> for television. Extended silent scenes with no dialogue are often used for dramatic effect in anime as in live action. This is typically considered too slow-paced for North American childrens cartoons where dialogue is considered the most important element. This was commonly seen in early anime dubs such as <a href="/wiki/Robotech" title="Robotech">Robotech</a> or <a href="/wiki/Voltron" title="Voltron">Voltron</a> where narration or character voiceovers (an animated equivalent to "thought balloons" in <a href="/wiki/Comics" title="Comics">comics</a>) would fill in silence. American cartoons are known for rarely having scenes without background music due to the same concerns over slow pacing. Therefore, in anime dubs, background music would also be edited into scenes that previously contained no background music.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Dubbing_(filmmaking)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19" title="Edit section: Dubbing the same language several times">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dubbing the same language several times</span></h2>
<p>In the case of languages with large communities (like English, Chinese, German, Spanish or French), a single translation may sound foreign to some groups, or even all of them. This is why a film may be translated to a certain language more than once: for example, the animated movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_Incredibles" title="The Incredibles">The Incredibles</a></i> was translated to European Spanish, <a href="/wiki/Mexican_Spanish" title="Mexican Spanish">Mexican Spanish</a>, <a href="/wiki/Venezuelan_Spanish" title="Venezuelan Spanish">Venezuelan Spanish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rioplatense_Spanish" title="Rioplatense Spanish">Rioplatense Spanish</a>. However, people from <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> clearly noticed a strong <i><a href="/wiki/Porte%C3%B1o" title="Porteño">porteño</a></i> accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation. Another example is the French dubbing of <a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, which is entirely different in <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> and <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, the humor being highly different for each audience (see <a href="/wiki/Non-English_versions_of_The_Simpsons" title="Non-English versions of The Simpsons">Non-English versions of The Simpsons</a>). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of the Simpsons, which they often do not find amusing. The French-language <a href="/wiki/T%C3%A9l%C3%A9toon_(Canada)" title="Télétoon (Canada)" class="mw-redirect">Télétoon</a> network once aired the Quebec Simpsons dub, as well as Parisian French dubs of <a href="/wiki/Futurama" title="Futurama">Futurama</a> and <a href="/wiki/Family_Guy" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a>, which were both similar to the Parisian Simpsons dub. The two latter shows have since been taken off the network (probably due to a lack of popularity), while The Simpsons continues its run on Télétoon. The <a href="/wiki/Quebec_French" title="Quebec French">Quebec French</a> dubbing of films, while generally made in accent-less <a href="/wiki/Standard_French" title="Standard French">Standard French</a>, often sounds peculiar to audiences in France, because of the persistence of some regionally neutral expression which may not sound quite natural to all audiences, and because Quebec French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, while French performers do not. Occasionally, for reasons of cost, American <a href="/wiki/Direct-to-video" title="Direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> films, such as the 1995 film <i>When the bullet hits the bone</i>, are released in France with a Quebec French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in <a href="/wiki/Portugal" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, for decades children films and television series were distributed using the good-quality Brazilian dub. Only in the 1990s dubbing began to gain importance in Portugal, thanks to the popularity of dubbed series like <a href="/wiki/Dragon_Ball" title="Dragon Ball">Dragon Ball</a>. <a href="/wiki/The_Lion_King" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a> became the first <a href="/wiki/Disney" title="Disney" class="mw-redirect">Disney</a> feature film to be completely dubbed into <a href="/wiki/European_Portuguese" title="European Portuguese">European Portuguese</a>, and subsequently all major animation films and series gained European Portuguese versions. In recent <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> releases, most of these Brazilian-dubbed classics were released with new Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian Portuguese dubs in Portugal.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> generally use the <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a> dubbed versions made in <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Although there are sometimes some differences concerning some local words or the pronunciation of some words there's no need to dub into their own versions because all films, shows and series are still dubbed into one single <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a> version made for the German speaking audience irrespective of any geographical borders.</p>
<p>Now and then it occurs that <a href="/wiki/Austrian_German" title="Austrian German">Austrian</a> or <a href="/wiki/Swiss_German" title="Swiss German">Swiss</a> actors also provide their voices in <a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a> dubbings but they have to speak in <a href="/wiki/High_German_languages" title="High German languages">High German</a> pronunciation of course, as it was for the film <a href="/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1991_film)" title="Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)">Beauty and the Beast</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mulan" title="Mulan">Mulan</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there are also exceptions. For the film <a href="/wiki/Babe_(film)" title="Babe (film)">Babe</a> and its sequel <a href="/wiki/Babe:_Pig_in_the_City" title="Babe: Pig in the City">Babe: Pig in the City</a> there exists three different German versions.<br />
In addition to the <a href="/wiki/Standard_German" title="Standard German">Standard German</a> version, the films were completely dubbed into <a href="/wiki/Austrian_German" title="Austrian German">Austrian German</a> and into <a href="/wiki/Swiss_German" title="Swiss German">Swiss German</a> including their own voice actors speaking in their own dialects. For <a href="/wiki/List_of_Disney_theatrical_animated_features" title="List of Disney theatrical animated features">Walt Disney films</a> there also exist several versions. In 1998 when the film <a href="/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film)" title="The Little Mermaid (1989 film)">The little Mermaid</a> was released anew, the film was redubbed in many other languages and so there was made a special cinema version, in which the characters speak in <a href="/wiki/Viennese_German" title="Viennese German">Viennese German</a> where Ursula, the Sea Witch was dubbed by the famous Austrian singer <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jazz_Gitti&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jazz Gitti (page does not exist)">Jazz Gitti</a>. This version was specially made for the cinema and was never available for <a href="/wiki/Videotape" title="Videotape">Videotape</a> or <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> but then there was produced a second Austrian version, which now is available for <a href="/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a>. But instead of using the <a href="/wiki/Viennese_German" title="Viennese German">Viennese</a> characters in this version, only a few characters were dubbed anew into <a href="/wiki/Austrian_German" title="Austrian German">standard Austrian</a> and the other characters were kept in the standard German version from 1998. In this way there exist Austrian versions for <a href="/wiki/Shrek_2" title="Shrek 2">Shrek 2</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cars_(film)" title="Cars (film)">Cars</a>.</p>
<p>The many martial arts movies from <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> that were imported under the unofficial banner <a href="/w/index.php?title=Kung_Fu_Theater&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kung Fu Theater (page does not exist)">Kung Fu Theater</a> were notorious for their seemingly careless dubbing which included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally hilarious, this has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to part of the 1980s culture.</p>
<p>While the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include script translation and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Audio_mixing_(television_and_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Audio mixing (television and film) (page does not exist)">audio mixing</a>. A literal translation of dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are native to the foreign language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly and follows the natural pattern of English speech. Voice actors in a dubbing capacity typically do not have the luxury of viewing the original film with the original voice actor and thus have little idea on how to perform the role. Also, on some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue separately, which lacks the dynamics gained from performing as a group.</p>

<p>It is now becoming possible to overcome some of the problems associated with dubbing using new technology. An application developed at <a href="/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a>, known as Video Rewrite, uses computer animation to match lip movements with the new voice track.

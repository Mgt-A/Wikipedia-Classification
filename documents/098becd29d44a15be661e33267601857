<p>The <b>Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition</b> (1914–17), also known as the <b>Endurance Expedition</b>, was the last major expedition of the <a href="/wiki/Heroic_Age_of_Antarctic_Exploration" title="Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration">Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration</a>. Conceived by <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton" title="Ernest Shackleton">Sir Ernest Shackleton</a>, the expedition sought to achieve the first land crossing of the <a href="/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> continent. After the <a href="/wiki/Amundsen%27s_South_Pole_expedition" title="Amundsen's South Pole expedition">conquest</a> of the <a href="/wiki/South_Pole" title="South Pole">South Pole</a> by <a href="/wiki/Roald_Amundsen" title="Roald Amundsen">Roald Amundsen</a> in 1911, the crossing remained, in Shackleton's words, the "one great main object of Antarctic journeyings".<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The expedition failed entirely to accomplish this aim, but it remains memorable as an epic of heroism and survival.</p>
<p>Shackleton had served in the Antarctic on <a href="/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott" title="Robert Falcon Scott">Captain Scott</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Discovery_Expedition" title="Discovery Expedition">Discovery Expedition</a>, 1901–04, and had led the <a href="/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition" title="Nimrod Expedition">British Antarctic Expedition</a>, 1907–09. The new expedition required a main party to sail to the <a href="/wiki/Weddell_Sea" title="Weddell Sea">Weddell Sea</a> and to land a shore party at around <a href="/wiki/Latitude" title="Latitude">latitude</a> 78°S, in the vicinity of <a href="/wiki/Vahsel_Bay" title="Vahsel Bay">Vahsel Bay</a>, in preparation for a transcontinental march via the South Pole to the <a href="/wiki/Ross_Sea" title="Ross Sea">Ross Sea</a>. A supporting group, the <a href="/wiki/Ross_Sea_party" title="Ross Sea party">Ross Sea party</a>, would meanwhile travel to the opposite side of the continent, establish camp in <a href="/wiki/McMurdo_Sound" title="McMurdo Sound">McMurdo Sound</a>, and from there lay a series of supply depots across the <a href="/wiki/Ross_Ice_Shelf" title="Ross Ice Shelf">Ross Ice Shelf</a> to the foot of the <a href="/wiki/Beardmore_Glacier" title="Beardmore Glacier">Beardmore Glacier</a>. These depots would be essential for the transcontinental party's survival, as they would not carry enough provisions to make the crossing otherwise. The expedition required two ships; the <a href="/wiki/Endurance_(1912_ship)" title="Endurance (1912 ship)"><i>Endurance</i></a> would take Shackleton's party to the Weddell Sea, and the <a href="/wiki/SY_Aurora" title="SY Aurora" class="mw-redirect"><i>Aurora</i></a>, under Captain <a href="/wiki/Aeneas_Mackintosh" title="Aeneas Mackintosh">Aeneas Mackintosh</a>, would take the Ross Sea party to McMurdo Sound.</p>
<p><i>Endurance</i> became beset in the ice of the Weddell Sea before reaching Vahsel Bay, and despite efforts to free the ship, she drifted northward with the pack throughout the Antarctic winter of 1915. Eventually, the ice crushed and sank the ship, stranding her 28-man complement on the ice and subjecting them to a series of harrowing episodes—months spent in makeshift camps on the ice, a journey in lifeboats to <a href="/wiki/Elephant_Island" title="Elephant Island">Elephant Island</a>, an 800-mile (1,300&#160;km) open-boat journey in the <a href="/wiki/James_Caird_(boat)" title="James Caird (boat)" class="mw-redirect"><i>James Caird</i></a>, and the first crossing of <a href="/wiki/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands" title="South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands">South Georgia</a>—that led eventually to their rescue without a single fatality. Meanwhile, the Ross Sea party overcame great hardships to fulfill its mission, after <i>Aurora</i> was blown from her moorings during a gale and could not return. The depots were laid, but three lives were lost in the process.</p>

<p>Shackleton lived restlessly and somewhat aimlessly after his return from the <a href="/wiki/Nimrod_Expedition" title="Nimrod Expedition">Nimrod Expedition</a> in 1909, despite the public acclaim that had greeted his achievement of a <a href="/wiki/Farthest_South" title="Farthest South">Furthest South</a> record at 88°23'S. He became—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir <a href="/wiki/Harry_Brittain" title="Harry Brittain">Harry Brittain</a>—"a bit of a floating gent".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The nature of his further Antarctic work now depended on the achievements of Scott's <a href="/wiki/Terra_Nova_Expedition" title="Terra Nova Expedition">Terra Nova Expedition</a>, which had left <a href="/wiki/Cardiff" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> in July 1910.</p>

<p>Shackleton's focus became clearer when the news of Amundsen's unexpected conquest of the South Pole reached him, on 11 March 1913. The Pole itself was no longer an objective, no matter what Scott's expedition achieved. Shackleton wrote: "The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration".<sup id="cite_ref-Huntford_350_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Huntford_350-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The next work, he said, would be "a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole".<sup id="cite_ref-Huntford_350_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Huntford_350-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> He could not be certain that this work would fall to him, because others were in the field. On 11 December 1911 a German expedition under <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_Filchner" title="Wilhelm Filchner">Wilhelm Filchner</a> had sailed from South Georgia, with the purpose of penetrating deep into the Weddell Sea, establishing a southerly base, and from there attempting to cross the continent to the Ross Sea.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Murphy-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> In late 1912 Filchner withdrew to South Georgia, having failed to set up his base headquarters.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Murphy-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> However, his discovery of possible landing sites in <a href="/wiki/Vahsel_Bay" title="Vahsel Bay">Vahsel Bay</a>, at around 78° latitude, was noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his expedition plans.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the wake of the sombre news of the fate of Captain Scott and his companions on their return journey from the South Pole, Shackleton initiated preparations for his own transcontinental expedition. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, <a href="/wiki/Tryggve_Gran" title="Tryggve Gran">Tryggve Gran</a> of Scott’s expedition, and former <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister" title="Prime Minister" class="mw-redirect">Prime Minister</a> <a href="/wiki/Lord_Rosebery" title="Lord Rosebery" class="mw-redirect">Lord Rosebery</a>, but got little joy from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: "I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles".<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> He got more support from <a href="/wiki/William_Speirs_Bruce" title="William Speirs Bruce">William Speirs Bruce</a>, leader of the <a href="/wiki/Scottish_National_Antarctic_Expedition" title="Scottish National Antarctic Expedition">Scottish National Antarctic Expedition</a> of 1902–04, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce gladly allowed Shackleton to adopt his plans,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> although the eventual plan announced by Shackleton owed little to Bruce. On 29 December 1913, having acquired certain promises of financial backing,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> he made his public announcement, in a letter to the <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> newspaper.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The Weddell Sea party would travel in the <a href="/wiki/Endurance_(1912_ship)" title="Endurance (1912 ship)"><i>Endurance</i></a> and proceed to the Vahsel Bay area, where fourteen men would land of whom six, under Shackleton, would form the Transcontinental Party.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> This group, with 100&#160;dogs, two motor sledges, and equipment "embodying everything that the experience of the leader and his expert advisers can suggest",<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_South_preface_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_South_preface-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> would undertake the 1,800-mile (2,900&#160;km) journey to the Ross Sea.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The remaining eight shore party members would carry out scientific work, three going to <a href="/wiki/Graham_Land" title="Graham Land">Graham Land</a>, three to <a href="/wiki/Enderby_Land" title="Enderby Land">Enderby Land</a> and two remaining at base camp.</p>

<p>Progress was delayed by frequent halts until leads opened up and <i>Endurance</i> was able to proceed steadily southward on 22 December. This remained the case for the next two weeks, taking the ship deep into the Weddell Sea. Further delays slowed progress during the early days of 1915, although from 7–10 January a lengthy run south brought them close to the 100-foot (30&#160;m) tall ice walls which masked the Antarctic coastal region of <a href="/wiki/Coats_Land" title="Coats Land">Coats Land</a>, discovered and named by William Speirs Bruce in 1904.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> On 15 December <i>Endurance</i> came abreast of a great glacier, the edge of which formed a bay which looked like an excellent landing place. However there was no question of landing so far north of Vahsel Bay, "except under pressure of necessity"—a decision that Shackleton would later regret.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_27.C2.A031_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_27.C2.A031-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> On 17 January, after a long run of 124&#160;miles (200&#160;km), the ship reached 76°27’S, where land was observed which Shackleton named <a href="/wiki/Caird_Coast" title="Caird Coast" class="mw-redirect">Caird Coast</a>, after his principal sponsor.

<p>They were now close to <a href="/wiki/Luitpold_Land" title="Luitpold Land" class="mw-redirect">Luitpold Land</a>, at the southern end of which lay their destination, Vahsel Bay.

<p>On 21 February, <i>Endurance</i>, held fast, drifted to her most southerly latitude, 76°58’S, and thereafter began moving steadily northwards with the pack.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> On 24 February, Shackleton, realizing that they would be beset throughout the winter, ordered ship’s routine abandoned. The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or "dogloos", while the ship’s interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A wireless apparatus was rigged, but the location was too remote to receive or transmit signals.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_35.E2.80.9340_41-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_35.E2.80.9340-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As to the possibility of release, Shackleton was aware of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner's ship, the <i>Deutschland</i>, which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship <i>Deutschland</i> was trapped on 6 March 1912, about 200&#160;miles (320&#160;km) off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63°37’, the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. A similar experience might allow <i>Endurance</i> to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring.<sup id="cite_ref-Murphy_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Murphy-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During February and March the rate of drift was very slow. At the end of March Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere 95&#160;miles (155&#160;km) since 19 January.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_43.E2.80.9347_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_43.E2.80.9347-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> However, as winter set in the speed of the drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April Shackleton recorded the nearby pack "piling and rafting against the masses of ice"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance "she would be crushed like an eggshell".<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_43.E2.80.9347_43-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_43.E2.80.9347-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75°23’S, 42°14’W, still drifting in a generally northerly direction. It would be at least four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice and it was possible that <i>Endurance</i> would not break free in time to make a repeat trip to the Vahsel Bay area.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> Shackleton now pondered the possibility of finding an alternative landing ground on the west shores of the Weddell Sea, if such a spot could be reached. "In the meantime", he wrote, "we must wait".<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_43.E2.80.9347_43-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_43.E2.80.9347-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The dark winter months of May, June and July were relatively uneventful, Shackleton’s greatest task being to maintain fitness, training and morale, a task he reportedly accomplished with great skill;<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45" title=""><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> football matches and dog racing took place on the ice, and skits were performed in the evenings. The first signs of the ice breaking up occurred on 22 July, and on 1 August, during a south-westerly gale with heavy snow, with <i>Endurance</i> at 72°26’S, 48°10’W, the ice floe began to break up all around the ship, the pressure forcing masses of ice beneath the keel and causing a heavy list to port. The position was perilous; Shackleton wrote: "The effects of the pressure around us was awe-inspiring. Mighty blocks of ice […] rose slowly till they jumped like cherry-stones gripped between thumb and finger [...] if the ship was once gripped firmly her fate would be sealed".<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46" title=""><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> This danger passed, and the succeeding weeks were quiet. During this relative lull the ship drifted into the area where, in 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell of the sealer <i>Wasp</i> reported seeing a coastline which he identified as <a href="/wiki/New_South_Greenland" title="New South Greenland">"New South Greenland"</a>. There was no sign of any such land; Shackleton concluded that Morrell had been deceived by the presence of large icebergs.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47" title=""><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Heavy buffeting returned, however, early in September, and continued intermittently thereafter. On 30 September the ship sustained "the worst squeeze we had experienced", and withstood what her captain, Worsley, described as fearful pressure, as she was "thrown to and fro like a shuttlecock a dozen times".<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> Shackleton had previously informed Worsley that he believed <i>Endurance</i> would as likely be destroyed as it would escape the ice.<sup id="cite_ref-Worsley_Endurance_49-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Worsley_Endurance-49" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Although the <i>Endurance</i> had proved capable of withstanding huge stresses, the ship's predicament was now dire, and when, on 24 October, its starboard side was forced against a large floe, the pressure of the ice on the side of the ship mounted until the hull began to bend and splinter; then water from below the ice began to pour into the ship. When the timbers broke they made terrific noises which sailors later described as being similar to the sound of "heavy fireworks and the blasting of guns".<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50" title=""><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> The supplies and three lifeboats were transferred to the ice, while the crew attempted to shore up the boat's hull and pump out the incoming sea, but after a few days, on 27 October 1915, and in freezing temperatures below −15°F (−25°C), Shackleton was forced to give the order to abandon ship. The position at abandonment was recorded as 69°05’S, 51°30’W.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51" title=""><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup> The wreckage remained afloat, and over the following weeks the crew salvaged further supplies and materials, including Hurley's photographs and cameras that had initially been left behind. From around 550&#160;plates Hurley chose the best 150, the maximum that could be carried, and smashed the rest.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52" title=""><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>With the loss of the ship, all thoughts of a transcontinental journey had to be abandoned, and the focus of the expedition shifted to one of straightforward survival. To this end Shackleton intended to march the crew towards either <a href="/wiki/Snow_Hill_Island" title="Snow Hill Island">Snow Hill Island</a>, the base of <a href="/wiki/Otto_Nordenskjold" title="Otto Nordenskjold" class="mw-redirect">Otto Nordenskiöld</a>’s <a href="/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> expedition in 1902–04,<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53" title=""><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> where emergency stores were to be found; <a href="/wiki/Paulet_Island" title="Paulet Island">Paulet Island</a>, where Shackleton knew there was a substantial food depot;<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> or <a href="/wiki/Robertson_Island" title="Robertson Island">Robertson Island</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> Shackleton believed they would be able to cross <a href="/wiki/Graham_Land" title="Graham Land">Graham Land</a> from any of these islands and reach the whaling outposts in <a href="/wiki/Wilhelmina_Bay" title="Wilhelmina Bay">Wilhelmina Bay</a>. The distance to Snow Hill Island from their initial stranded position was calculated by Worsley to be 312&#160;miles (500&#160;km), with a further 120&#160;miles (190&#160;km) to Wilhelmina Bay.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" title=""><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup> They would have to take with them food, fuel, survival gear and three heavy lifeboats.</p>
<p>The march started on 30 October, but problems quickly arose. The condition of the sea ice around them made travel almost impossible. As the horizontal pressure had increased, the sea ice buckled and rose up on itself, forming large pressure ridges often 10&#160;feet (3.0&#160;m) high. Over this surface, in two days the party managed to travel barely two miles (3.2&#160;km). On 1 November Shackleton abandoned the march and decided, in conjunction with Wild and Worsley, that they would make camp and await the break-up of the ice.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57" title=""><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> They gave the name "Ocean Camp" to the flat and solid-looking floe on which their aborted march had ended, and settled down to wait. Parties continued to revisit the <i>Endurance</i> wreck, which was still drifting with the ice a short distance from the camp. More of the abandoned supplies were retrieved until, on 21 November 1915, the ship finally slipped beneath the ice.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58" title=""><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The speed of drift had started to increase after 1 November, and by the 7th was a steady three miles a day. By 5 December they had passed 68°S, but the direction was turning slightly east of north. This was taking them to a position from which it would be difficult or impossible to reach Snow Hill Island. However, to its north-east lay Paulet Island, which now became the target destination.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59" title=""><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> It was about 250&#160;miles (400&#160;km) away, and Shackleton was anxious to reduce the length of the lifeboat journey that would be necessary to reach it. Therefore, on 21 December he announced a second march, to begin on 23 December.<sup id="cite_ref-Huntford_473.E2.80.9376_60-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Huntford_473.E2.80.9376-60" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Conditions, however, had not improved since the earlier attempt. Temperatures had risen and it was uncomfortably warm, with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges. On 27 December ship’s carpenter <a href="/wiki/Harry_McNish" title="Harry McNish">Harry McNish</a> (or McNeish—there is no consensus as to spelling among chroniclers) rebelled and refused to work. He argued that <a href="/wiki/Admiralty_law" title="Admiralty law">Ship’s Articles</a> had lapsed since <i>Endurance</i>’s sinking, and that he was no longer under orders. Shackleton’s firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel, but the incident was never forgotten.<sup id="cite_ref-Huntford_473.E2.80.9376_60-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Huntford_473.E2.80.9376-60" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> In due course McNish would make his own contribution to the salvation of the party, but he was nonetheless one of only four of the crew denied the <a href="/wiki/Polar_Medal" title="Polar Medal">Polar Medal</a> on Shackleton’s recommendation.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title=""><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup> Two days later, with only seven and a half miles’ (12&#160;km) progress achieved in seven back-breaking days, Shackleton called a halt, observing: "It would take us over three hundred days to reach the land".<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_106_63-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_106-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called "Patience Camp", which would be their home for more than three months.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_106_63-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_106-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Supplies were now running low. Hurley and Macklin were sent back to Ocean Camp to recover food that had been left there in order to lighten the sledging teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916 Shackleton sent a larger party back, to recover the third lifeboat that had also been left. Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed, and seal meat, which had simply added variety to their diet before, became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on Shackleton’s orders, because the dogs' requirements for seal meat were excessive.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64" title=""><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> The final two teams were shot on 2 April, by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations. Meanwhile, the rate of drift became erratic; after being held at around 67° for several weeks, at the end of January there was a series of rapid north-eastward movements which, by 17 March, brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island, but 60&#160;miles (97&#160;km) to its east. "It might have been six hundred for all the chance we had of reaching it across the broken sea-ice", Shackleton recorded.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_116_65-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_116-65" title=""><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Frustratingly, land was continuously in sight. The peak of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Haddington" title="Mount Haddington">Mount Haddington</a> on <a href="/wiki/James_Ross_Island" title="James Ross Island">James Ross Island</a> remained in view as the party drifted slowly by. With Snow Hill and Paulet Island now inaccessible, Shackleton wrote that all hopes were fixed on two remaining small islands at the northern extremity of Graham Land: <a href="/wiki/Clarence_Island_(South_Shetland_Islands)" title="Clarence Island (South Shetland Islands)">Clarence Island</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elephant_Island" title="Elephant Island">Elephant Island</a>, about 100&#160;miles (160&#160;km) due north of their position on 25 March.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_116_65-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_116-65" title=""><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup> He then had further thoughts and decided that <a href="/wiki/Deception_Island" title="Deception Island">Deception Island</a> might be a better target destination. This lay far to the west, towards the end of a chain which formed the <a href="/wiki/South_Shetland_Islands" title="South Shetland Islands">South Shetland Islands</a>, but Shackleton thought it might be attainable by island-hopping. Its advantage was that it was sometimes visited by whalers and might contain provisions.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_119.E2.80.9321_66-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_119.E2.80.9321-66" title=""><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> All of these destinations would require a perilous journey in the lifeboats, once the pack upon which they were drifting finally broke up. Prior to this journey the lifeboats were each named after the expedition’s chief financial sponsors: <i>James Caird</i>, <i>Dudley Docker</i> and <i>Stancomb Wills</i>.</p>

<p>The end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April, when the floe suddenly split. The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party’s enforced departure.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_119.E2.80.9321_66-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_119.E2.80.9321-66" title=""><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_119.E2.80.9321_66-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_119.E2.80.9321-66" title=""><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> At 1 pm on 9 April the <i>Dudley Docker</i> was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the <i>James Caird</i>, Worsley the <i>Dudley Docker</i>, and navigating officer <a href="/w/index.php?title=Hubert_Hudson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hubert Hudson (page does not exist)">Hubert Hudson</a> was nominally in charge of the <i>Stancomb Wills</i>, though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was <a href="/wiki/Tom_Crean" title="Tom Crean" class="mw-redirect">Tom Crean</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67" title=""><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The next few days were very difficult. The boats were still in the pack, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up on to them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve. Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April rejected the various island options and decided on <a href="/wiki/Hope_Bay" title="Hope Bay">Hope Bay</a>, at the very tip of Graham Land.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68" title=""><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup> However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as -20°F (−30°C), with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69" title=""><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup> Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the only practical option.</p>
<p>On 14 April the boats lay off the south-east coast of this island, but there was no question of a landing, since this shore was one of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. The following day, the <i>James Caird</i> rounded the eastern point of the island to reach the northern lee shore, and eventually discovered a narrow shingle beach at which Shackleton decided to land. Soon after, all three boats, which had been separated during the previous night, were reunited at the landing place. It was soon clear from high tide marks, however, that this beach would not serve as a long-term camp.<sup id="cite_ref-Shackleton_142.E2.80.9350_70-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Shackleton_142.E2.80.9350-70" title=""><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup> The next day Wild and a crew set off in the <i>Stancomb Wills</i> to explore the coast for somewhere better. They returned with news of a long spit of land, seven miles (11&#160;km) to the west, which seemed possible as a camping-ground. With minimum delay the men returned to the boats and transferred to this new location, which they later christened Point Wild.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71" title=""><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, and rarely visited by whalers or any other ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be necessary to summon help. The only realistic way that this could be done was to adapt one of the boats for the 800-mile (1,300&#160;km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on to Deception Island (an "infinitely less dangerous journey"<sup id="cite_ref-Fisher_72-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fisher-72" title=""><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup>), presumably because the physical condition of his party precluded further extended exposure to the rough winter seas. <a href="/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego" title="Tierra del Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Falkland_Islands" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> were closer than South Georgia, but would require sailing against the prevailing winds.</p>
<p>Shackleton selected his boat party: himself, Worsley as navigator, Crean, McNish, <a href="/wiki/John_Vincent_(sailor)" title="John Vincent (sailor)">John Vincent</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Timothy_McCarthy_(sailor)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Timothy McCarthy (sailor) (page does not exist)">Timothy McCarthy</a>. On instructions from Shackleton, McNish immediately set about adapting the <i>James Caird</i>, cleverly improvising tools and materials.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73" title=""><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> Frank Wild was to be left in charge of the Elephant Island party, with instructions to make for Deception Island the following spring, should Shackleton not return.<sup id="cite_ref-Fisher_72-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fisher-72" title=""><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup> Shackleton took supplies for only four weeks, knowing that if land had not been reached within that time the boat would be lost.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74" title=""><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The 22.5-foot (6.85&#160;m) <i>James Caird</i> was launched on 24 April 1916. "Astonishing" and "incredible" are words typically used<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75" title=""><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup> to describe the open-boat journey which followed. Everything depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, based on observations that would have to be made in the most unfavourable of conditions.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76" title=""><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup> The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost brought about the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in twenty-six years at sea.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77" title=""><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup> On 8 May, thanks to Worsley’s navigation, South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78" title=""><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup> Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the exhausted party struggled ashore at <a href="/wiki/King_Haakon_Bay" title="King Haakon Bay">King Haakon Bay</a>.</p>

<p>The arrival of the <i>James Caird</i> at King Haakon Bay was followed by a period of much-needed rest and recuperation, while Shackleton pondered the next move. The populated whaling stations of South Georgia lay on the northern coast. To reach them would mean either another boat journey around the island, or a land crossing through its unexplored interior. The condition of the <i>James Caird</i>, and the physical state of the party, particularly Vincent and McNish, meant that only the second of these options was viable.<sup id="cite_ref-Fisher_383_79-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fisher_383-79" title=""><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After five days the party took the boat a short distance eastwards, to the head of a deep bay which would be the starting point for the crossing. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean would undertake the land journey, the others remaining at what they christened "<a href="/wiki/Peggotty_Bluff" title="Peggotty Bluff">Peggotty Camp</a>",<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80" title=""><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup> to be picked up later by boat. A storm on 18 May delayed their start, but by two o'clock the following morning the weather was clear and calm, and an hour later the crossing party set out.<sup id="cite_ref-Fisher_383_79-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fisher_383-79" title=""><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Without a map, the route they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to 3,000&#160;feet (910&#160;m) and could see the northern coast. They were above <a href="/wiki/Possession_Bay" title="Possession Bay">Possession Bay</a>, which meant that they were too far to the west and would need to move eastward to reach <a href="/wiki/Stromness,_South_Georgia" title="Stromness, South Georgia">Stromness</a>, their target whaling station. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81" title=""><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup> There was no question of rest—they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge. Early next morning, seeing <a href="/wiki/Husvik_Harbour" title="Husvik Harbour" class="mw-redirect">Husvik Harbour</a> below them, they knew that they were on the right path. At seven o'clock in the morning they heard the steam whistle sound from the whaling station, "the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914".<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82" title=""><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup> After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83" title=""><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Shackleton, not a religious man, wrote afterwards: "I have no doubt that <a href="/wiki/Divine_Providence" title="Divine Providence">Providence</a> guided us…I know that during that long and racking march of thirty-six hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers it seemed to me often that we were four, not three".<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84" title=""><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></a></sup> This image of a fourth traveller—echoed by Worsley and Crean—was taken up by <a href="/wiki/T._S._Eliot" title="T.

<p>Shackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggoty Camp to be picked up.

Shackleton’s return to Elephant Island, 30&#160;August 1916. All 22&#160;men left there had survived.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in <a href="/wiki/Stromness_(South_Georgia)" title="Stromness (South Georgia)" class="mw-redirect">Stromness</a>, after securing the use of a large whaler, <i>The Southern Sky</i>, which was laid up in <a href="/wiki/South_Georgia" title="South Georgia" class="mw-redirect">Husvik Harbour</a>. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel drew close to Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70&#160;miles (110&#160;km) from the island. <i>The Southern Sky</i> was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to <a href="/wiki/Port_Stanley" title="Port Stanley" class="mw-redirect">Port Stanley</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Falkland_Islands" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87" title=""><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> by cable of his whereabouts, and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the <a href="/wiki/Admiralty" title="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in <a href="/wiki/Montevideo" title="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, Shackleton secured from the <a href="/wiki/Uruguay" title="Uruguay">Uruguayan</a> government the loan of a tough trawler, <i>Instituto de Pesca No. 1</i>, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to <a href="/wiki/Punta_Arenas" title="Punta Arenas" class="mw-redirect">Punta Arenas</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>, where they encountered Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner <i>Emma</i>. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again.<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88" title=""><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89" title=""><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>It was now mid-August. Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to lend him <i>Yelcho</i>, a small, tough steamer that had assisted <i>Emma</i> during the previous attempt. The Government agreed, and on 25 August <i>Yelcho</i>, captained by <a href="/wiki/Luis_Pardo" title="Luis Pardo">Luis Pardo</a>, set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, Providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 am on 30 August the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90" title=""><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>After Shackleton left with the <i>James Caird</i>, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92" title=""><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup> The first need for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of Marston and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Lionel_Greenstreet&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lionel Greenstreet (page does not exist)">Lionel Greenstreet</a>, a hut (nicknamed the "Snuggery") was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made more or less weatherproof. It was a crude shelter, but effective.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93" title=""><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>No one knew how long they would have to wait for rescue. Wild, over-optimistically, initially estimated one month, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94" title=""><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> This policy led to sharp disagreements with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Orde-Lees" title="Thomas Orde-Lees">Thomas Orde-Lees</a>. Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions,<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95" title=""><span>[</span>96<span>]</span></a></sup> unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.</p>
<p>Wild did what he could to establish and maintain routines and activities that would relieve the tedium, as the weeks spread out well beyond his initial optimistic forecast. A lookout was kept for the supposedly imminent arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin.<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96" title=""><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup> Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but nothing could altogether stem the growing feelings of despondency as months passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55&#160;minutes, and was a total success.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97" title=""><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup> By 23 August, it appeared that Wild’s no-stockpiling policy was in ruins. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship, food supplies were running out and no penguins were coming ashore. Orde-Lees wrote: "We shall have to eat the one who dies first […] there’s many a true word said in jest".<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98" title=""><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup> Wild’s thoughts were turning seriously to the possibility of a boat trip to Deception Island (he planned to set out on 5 October in the hoping of crossing with a whaling ship<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99" title=""><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup>) when, on 30 August 1916, the ordeal ended suddenly with the appearance of the relief ship.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100" title=""><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Her arrival in McMurdo Sound on 15 January 1915 was later in the season than planned, but the party’s commander Aeneas Mackintosh made immediate plans for a depot-laying journey on the Ross Ice Shelf, believing that Shackleton might attempt a crossing from the Weddell Sea during that first season.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101" title=""><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup> Neither the men nor the dogs were acclimatized, and the party was, as a whole, very inexperienced in ice conditions.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102" title=""><span>[</span>103<span>]</span></a></sup> This first, hurried journey on the ice resulted in the loss of ten of the party’s 18&#160;dogs, a single incomplete depot, and a frost-bitten and generally demoralized shore party.</p>

<p>Worse was to follow in May, when <i>Aurora</i>, anchored at the <a href="/wiki/Cape_Evans" title="Cape Evans">Cape Evans</a> headquarters, was blown out to sea during a gale, and was not able to return, being trapped in a floe. She drifted in the ice until 12 February 1916, a distance of around 1,600&#160;miles (2,600&#160;km) before releasing herself and limping to New Zealand. She carried with her the greater part of the shore party’s fuel, food rations, clothing and equipment, although fortunately the sledging rations for the depots had been landed ashore. However, in order to continue with its mission, the stranded shore party had to re-supply and re-equip itself from the leftovers from earlier expeditions, notably <a href="/wiki/Captain_Scott" title="Captain Scott" class="mw-redirect">Captain Scott</a>’s <a href="/wiki/Terra_Nova_Expedition" title="Terra Nova Expedition">Terra Nova Expedition</a>. Due to the party's ingenious improvisations the second season’s depot-laying began on schedule, in September 1915.<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103" title=""><span>[</span>104<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During the following months, by a supreme effort, the required depots were laid, at whole degree intervals right across the Ross Ice Shelf to the Beardmore Glacier. On the return journey the entire depot-laying party was attacked by scurvy. During the struggle to return to base <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Spencer-Smith" title="Arnold Spencer-Smith">Arnold Spencer-Smith</a>, the expedition’s chaplain and photographer, collapsed and died on the ice. The remainder reached the temporary shelter of <a href="/wiki/Hut_Point" title="Hut Point" class="mw-redirect">Hut Point</a> and recovered there. On 8 May 1916 Mackintosh and Hayward decided to walk across the unstable sea ice to <a href="/wiki/Cape_Evans" title="Cape Evans">Cape Evans</a>, were caught in a blizzard, and were not seen again. The seven survivors then endured eight more months of hardship until on 10 January 1917 the <i>Aurora</i>, which had been refitted in New Zealand, arrived to transport them back to civilization.</p>
<p>Shackleton accompanied the <i>Aurora</i> as a supernumerary officer, having been denied command by the governments of New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain, who had jointly organized the relief. He thus participated in the rescues of both parts of his expedition, but his wayward attitude to the original organizational arrangements for the Ross Sea party was held against him. Despite its chaotic beginnings, its muddles, the disastrous loss of <i>Aurora</i>, and the three deaths, the Ross Sea party was the only part of the entire expedition that fulfilled its original mission, even though the failures of the Weddell Sea party meant that it did so in vain.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104" title=""><span>[</span>105<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The rescued party, having had its last contact with civilization in 1914, was unaware of the course of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War</a>.

<p>Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service.

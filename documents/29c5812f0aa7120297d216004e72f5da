<dl>
<dt><span id="ace-to-X"></span> ace-to-five, ace-to-six</dt>
<dd>Methods of evaluating low hands. See <a href="/wiki/Lowball_(poker)" title="Lowball (poker)">lowball</a>.</dd>
<dt><span id="act"></span> act</dt>
<dd>To make a play (bet, call, raise, or fold) at the required time. <i>It is Ted's turn to act.</i> Compare to "in turn".</dd>
<dt><span id="action"></span> action</dt>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>A player's turn to act. <i>The action is on you</i>.</li>
<li>A willingness to gamble. <i>I'll give you action</i> or <i>There's plenty of action in this game.</i></li>
<li>A bet, along with all the calls of that bet. For example, if one player makes a $5 bet and three other players call, he is said to have $5 "in action", and to have received $15 worth of action on his bet. Usually this term comes into play when figuring side pots when one or more players is all in. See <a href="/wiki/Table_stakes" title="Table stakes">table stakes</a>.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt><span id="action_button"></span> action button</dt>
<dd>A marker similar to a kill button, on which a player places an extra forced bet. In a <a href="/wiki/Seven-card_stud" title="Seven-card stud">seven-card stud</a> high-low game, the action button is awarded to the winner of a <a href="#scoop" title="">scoop</a> pot above a certain size, signifying that in the next pot, that player will be required to post an amount representing a completion of the <a href="/wiki/Betting_(poker)#Open" title="Betting (poker)">bring-in</a> to a full bet. For example, in a stud game with $2 and $4 betting limits and a $1 bring-in, a player with the action button must post $2; after the cards are dealt, the player with the low card must still pay the $1 bring-in, then when the betting reaches the player who posted the $2, he is required to leave it in as a raise of the bring-in (and has the option to raise further). Players in between the bring-in and the action button can just call the bring-in, but they know ahead of time that they will be raised by the action button.</dd>
<dt><span id="action_card"></span> action card</dt>
<dd>In <a href="/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em" title="Texas hold 'em">Texas hold 'em</a> or other community card games, a card appearing on the board that causes significant betting action because it helps two or more players. For example, an ace on the flop when two players each hold an ace.</dd>
<dt><span id="action_only"></span> action only</dt>
<dd>In many cardrooms, with respect to an all-in bet, only a full (or half) bet can be reraised. Anything less than a full (or half) bet is considered to be <i>action only</i>, that is, other players can call the bet but not raise it. For example, Alice bets $100. Bob calls. Carol goes all in for $119. When the action returns to Alice and Bob, they may only call the extra $19; they cannot raise it. Carol's raise is called <i>action only</i>. Compare to "<a href="#full_bet_rule" title="">full bet rule</a>", "<a href="#half_bet_rule" title="">half bet rule</a>".</dd>
<dt><span id="active_player"></span> active player</dt>
<dd>A player still involved in the pot. If there are <a href="#side_pot" title="">side pots</a>, an <a href="#all_in" title="">all-in</a> player may be active in some pots, but not in others.</dd>
<dt><span id="add-on"></span> add-on</dt>
<dd>In a live game, to buy more chips before you have busted. In <a href="/wiki/Poker_tournament" title="Poker tournament">tournament</a> play, a single rebuy for which all players are eligible regardless of their stack size. This is usually allowed only once, at the end of the rebuy period. The add-on often offers more chips per dollar invested than the buyin and rebuys. Compare with "<a href="#rebuy" title="">rebuy</a>".</dd>
<dt><span id="advertising"></span> advertising</dt>
<dd>To make an obvious play or expose cards in such a way as to deliberately convey an impression to your opponents about your style of play. For example, to make a bad play or bluff to give the impression that you bluff frequently (hoping opponents will then call your legitimate bets) or to show only good hands to give the impression that you rarely bluff (hoping opponents will then fold when you do).</dd>
<dt><span id="aggressive"></span> aggressive, aggression</dt>
<dd>See <a href="/wiki/Aggression_(poker)" title="Aggression (poker)">aggression</a>. Compare to "<a href="#loose" title="">loose</a>", "<a href="#tight" title="">tight</a>", "<a href="#passive" title="">passive</a>".</dd>
<dt><span id="air"></span> air</dt>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/Lowball_(poker)" title="Lowball (poker)">lowball</a>, "giving air" is letting an opponent who might otherwise fold know that you intend to draw one or more cards to induce him to call.</li>
<li>Nothing, as in <i>That last bluff was with total air</i>, or <i>I caught air on the river</i>.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt><span id="all_in"></span> all in</dt>
<dd>Having bet all of your chips in the current hand. See <a href="/wiki/Betting_(poker)#.22All_in.22" title="Betting (poker)">all in</a>.</dd>
<dt><span id="angle"></span> angle</dt>
<dd>A technically legal, but borderline unethical, play. For example, deliberately miscalling one's own hand to induce a fold, or placing odd amounts of chips in the pot to confuse opponents about whether you mean to call or raise. A player employing such tactics is called an "angle shooter".</dd>
<dt><span id="ante"></span> ante</dt>
<dd>See <a href="/wiki/Betting_(poker)#Ante" title="Betting (poker)">ante</a>.</dd>
<dt><span id="ante_off"></span> ante off</dt>
<dd>In <a href="/wiki/Poker_tournament" title="Poker tournament">tournament</a> play, to force an absent player to continue paying antes, blinds, bring-ins, or other forced bets so that the contest remains fair to the other players. <i>Go ahead and take that phone call. We'll ante you off until you get back.</i> Also "<a href="#blind_off" title="">blind off</a>".</dd>

<dt><span id="backdoor"></span> backdoor</dt>
</dl>
<ol>

<dt><span id="back_in"></span> back in</dt>
<dd>To enter a pot by checking and then calling someone else's <a href="/wiki/Betting_(poker)#Open" title="Betting (poker)">open</a> on the first betting round. Usually used in games like <a href="/wiki/Five-card_draw" title="Five-card draw">Jackpots</a>, meaning to enter without openers.</dd>
<dt><span id="back_into"></span> back into</dt>
<dd>To win a pot with a hand that would have folded to any bet. For example, two players enter a pot of <a href="/wiki/Draw_poker" title="Draw poker">draw poker</a>, both drawing to <a href="/wiki/Rank_of_hands_(poker)#Flush" title="Rank of hands (poker)" class="mw-redirect">flushes</a>. Both miss, and check after the draw. The player with the ace-high draw "backs into" winning the pot against the player with only a king-high draw. Also to make a backdoor draw, for example, a player who starts a hand with three of a kind, but makes a runner-runner flush, can be said to back into the flush.</dd>
<dt><span id="backraise"></span> backraise</dt>

<li>Describing money in play but not visible as chips in front of a player. For example, a player may announce "I've got $100 behind" while handing money to a casino employee, meaning that he intends those chips to be in play as soon as they are brought to him.</li>

<dd>While A-2-3-4 and A-K-Q-J are the only truly one-ended straight draw possibilities, an open-ended straight draw could be considered one-ended if one of the card ranks needed to complete it would also give an opponent a hand of higher rank than a straight. Example: Player A has 8s-9c in the pocket, Player B has 10d-10c in the pocket. The flop and turn were 7c-6d-Ks-6h. Player B would complete a full house with a 6 or a 10. Player A would complete a straight with a 5 or a 10. While strictly speaking Player A has an open-ended straight draw, it can also be referred to as a one-ended straight draw because one of the ends - the 10 - would not help the hand. The odds of completing a one-ended straight draw are the same as the odds of completing an inside straight draw<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p><b>Strategic management</b> is the art, science and craft of formulating, implementing and evaluating cross-functional decisions that will enable an organization to achieve its long-term objectives<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>. It is the process of specifying the <a href="/wiki/Organization" title="Organization">organization</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Mission" title="Mission">mission</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vision" title="Vision">vision</a> and objectives, developing policies and plans, often in terms of projects and programs, which are designed to achieve these objectives, and then allocating resources to implement the policies and plans, projects and programs. Strategic management seeks to coordinate and integrate the activities of the various functional areas of a business in order to achieve long-term organizational objectives. A <a href="/wiki/Balanced_scorecard" title="Balanced scorecard">balanced scorecard</a> is often used to evaluate the overall performance of the <a href="/wiki/Business" title="Business">business</a> and its progress towards objectives.</p>
<p>Strategic management is the highest level of managerial activity. Strategies are typically planned, crafted or guided by the <a href="/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" title="Chief Executive Officer" class="mw-redirect">Chief Executive Officer</a>, approved or authorized by the <a href="/wiki/Board_of_directors" title="Board of directors">Board of directors</a>, and then implemented under the supervision of the organization's top management <a href="/wiki/Team" title="Team">team</a> or senior executives. Strategic management provides overall direction to the enterprise and is closely related to the field of <a href="/wiki/Organization_Studies" title="Organization Studies" class="mw-redirect">Organization Studies</a>. In the field of business administration it is useful to talk about "strategic alignment" between the organization and its environment or "strategic consistency". According to Arieu (2007), "there is strategic consistency when the actions of an organization are consistent with the expectations of management, and these in turn are with the market and the context."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Strategic management is an ongoing process that evaluates and controls the business and the industries in which the company is involved; assesses its competitors and sets goals and strategies to meet all existing and potential competitors; and then reassesses each strategy annually or quarterly [i.e. regularly] to determine how it has been implemented and whether it has succeeded or needs replacement by a new strategy to meet changed circumstances, new technology, new competitors, a new economic environment., or a new social, financial, or political environment.” (Lamb, 1984:ix)<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strategic management is a combination of three main processes which are as follows</p>
<p><a name="Strategy_formulation" id="Strategy_formulation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Strategic_management&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Strategy formulation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategy formulation</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Performing a situation analysis, self-evaluation and competitor analysis: both internal and external; both micro-environmental and macro-environmental.</li>
<li>Concurrent with this assessment, objectives are set. These objectives should be parallel to a timeline; some are in the short-term and others on the long-term. This involves crafting vision statements (long term view of a possible future), mission statements (the role that the organization gives itself in society), overall corporate objectives (both financial and strategic), strategic business unit objectives (both financial and strategic), and tactical objectives.</li>
<li>These objectives should, in the light of the situation analysis, suggest a strategic plan. The plan provides the details of how to achieve these objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>This three-step strategy formulation process is sometimes referred to as determining where you are now, determining where you want to go, and then determining how to get there. These three questions are the essence of <a href="/wiki/Strategic_planning" title="Strategic planning">strategic planning</a>. I/O Economics for the external factors and <a href="/wiki/RBV" title="RBV" class="mw-redirect">RBV</a> for the internal factors.</p>
<p><a name="Strategy_implementation" id="Strategy_implementation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Strategic_management&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Strategy implementation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategy implementation</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Allocation and management of sufficient resources (financial, personnel, time, technology support)</li>
<li>Establishing a chain of command or some alternative structure (such as cross functional teams)</li>
<li>Assigning responsibility of specific tasks or processes to specific individuals or groups</li>
<li>It also involves managing the process. This includes monitoring results, comparing to benchmarks and best practices, evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the process, controlling for variances, and making adjustments to the process as necessary.</li>
<li>When implementing specific programs, this involves acquiring the requisite resources, developing the process, training, process testing, documentation, and integration with (and/or conversion from) legacy processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, when the strategy implementation processes, there have been many problems arising such as human relations and/or the employee-communication. At this stage, the greatest implementation problem usually involves marketing strategy, with emphasis on the appropriate timing of new products. An organization, with a effective management, should try to implement its plans without signaling the fact to its competitors.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In order for a policy to work, there must be a level of consistency from every person in an organization, including from the management. This is what needs to occur on the tactical level of management as well as strategic.</p>
<p><a name="Strategy_evaluation" id="Strategy_evaluation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Strategic_management&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Strategy evaluation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strategy evaluation</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Measuring the effectiveness of the organizational strategy, it's extremely important to conduct a <a href="/wiki/SWOT_analysis" title="SWOT analysis">SWOT analysis</a> to figure out the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (both internal and external) of the entity in question. This may require to take certain precautionary measures or even to change the entire strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In corporate strategy, Johnson and Scholes present a model in which strategic options are evaluated against three key success criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitability (would it work?)</li>
<li>Feasibility (can it be made to work?)</li>
<li>Acceptability (will they work it?)</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Suitability" id="Suitability"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Strategic_management&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Suitability">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Suitability</span></h3>
<p>Suitability deals with the overall rationale of the strategy. The key point to consider is whether the strategy would address the key strategic issues underlined by the organisation's strategic position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it make economic sense?</li>
<li>Would the organisation obtain <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale" class="mw-redirect">economies of scale</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scope" title="Economies of scope">economies of scope</a> or <a href="/wiki/Experience_economy" title="Experience economy" class="mw-redirect">experience economy</a>?</li>
<li>Would it be suitable in terms of environment and capabilities?</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools that can be used to evaluate suitability include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranking strategic options</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Decision_tree" title="Decision tree">Decision trees</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/What-if_analysis" title="What-if analysis" class="mw-redirect">What-if analysis</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Feasibility" id="Feasibility"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Strategic_management&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Feasibility">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Feasibility</span></h4>
<p>Feasibility is concerned with the resources required to implement the strategy are available, can be developed or obtained. Resources include <b>funding</b>, <b>people</b>, <b>time</b> and <b>information</b>.</p>
<p>Tools that can be used to evaluate feasibility include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Cash_flow" title="Cash flow">cash flow</a> analysis and <a href="/wiki/Forecasting" title="Forecasting">forecasting</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Break-even" title="Break-even">break-even</a> analysis</li>
<li>resource deployment analysis</li>
</ul>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Strategic_management&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Acceptability">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Acceptability</span></h4>
<p>Acceptability is concerned with the expectations of the identified stakeholders (mainly shareholders, employees and customers) with the expected performance outcomes, which can be return, risk and stakeholder reactions.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Return</b> deals with the benefits expected by the stakeholders (financial and non-financial). For example, shareholders would expect the increase of their wealth, employees would expect improvement in their careers and customers would expect better value for money.</li>
<li><b>Risk</b> deals with the probability and consequences of failure of a strategy (financial and non-financial).</li>
<li><b>Stakeholder reactions</b> deals with anticipating the likely reaction of stakeholders. Shareholders could oppose the issuing of new shares, employees and unions could oppose outsourcing for fear of losing their jobs, customers could have concerns over a merger with regards to quality and support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools that can be used to evaluate acceptability include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/What-if_analysis" title="What-if analysis" class="mw-redirect">what-if analysis</a></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Stakeholder" title="Stakeholder">stakeholder</a> mapping</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="General_approaches" id="General_approaches"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Strategic_management&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: General approaches">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">General approaches</span></h2>
<p>In general terms, there are two main approaches, which are opposite but complement each other in some ways, to strategic management:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Industrial Organizational Approach</b>
<ul>
<li>based on <a href="/wiki/Macroeconomics" title="Macroeconomics">economic theory</a> — deals with issues like competitive rivalry, <a href="/wiki/Resource_allocation" title="Resource allocation">resource allocation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale" class="mw-redirect">economies of scale</a></li>
<li>assumptions — rationality, self discipline behaviour, profit maximization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>The Sociological Approach</b>
<ul>
<li>deals primarily with human interactions</li>
<li>assumptions — bounded rationality, satisfying behaviour, profit sub-optimality. An example of a company that currently operates this way is <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategic management techniques can be viewed as bottom-up, top-down, or collaborative processes. In the bottom-up approach, employees submit proposals to their managers who, in turn, funnel the best ideas further up the organization. This is often accomplished by a capital budgeting process. Proposals are assessed using financial criteria such as <a href="/wiki/Return_on_investment" title="Return on investment" class="mw-redirect">return on investment</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cost-benefit_analysis" title="Cost-benefit analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a>. <a href="/wiki/Cost_underestimation" title="Cost underestimation">Cost underestimation</a> and benefit overestimation are major sources of error. The proposals that are approved form the substance of a new strategy, all of which is done without a grand strategic design or a strategic architect. The top-down approach is the most common by far. In it, the CEO, possibly with the assistance of a strategic planning team, decides on the overall direction the company should take. Some organizations are starting to experiment with collaborative strategic planning techniques that recognize the emergent nature of strategic decisions.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Strategic_management&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: The strategy hierarchy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The strategy hierarchy</span></h2>
<p>In most (large) corporations there are several levels of management. Strategic management is the highest of these levels in the sense that it is the broadest - applying to all parts of the firm - while also incorporating the longest time horizon. It gives direction to corporate values, corporate culture, corporate goals, and corporate missions. Under this broad corporate strategy there are typically business-level competitive strategies and functional unit strategies.</p>
<p><b>Corporate strategy</b> refers to the overarching strategy of the diversified firm. Such a corporate strategy answers the questions of "in which businesses should we compete?" and "how does being in these business create synergy and/or add to the competitive advantage of the corporation as a whole?"</p>
<p><b>Business strategy</b> refers to the aggregated strategies of single business firm or a strategic business unit (SBU) in a diversified corporation. According to <a href="/wiki/Michael_Porter" title="Michael Porter">Michael Porter</a>, a firm must formulate a business strategy that incorporates either <a href="/wiki/Cost_leadership" title="Cost leadership">cost leadership</a>, <a href="/wiki/Differentiation" title="Differentiation">differentiation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Focus" title="Focus">focus</a> in order to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage and long-term success in its chosen arenas or industries.</p>
<p><b>Functional strategies</b> include <a href="/wiki/Marketing_strategies" title="Marketing strategies" class="mw-redirect">marketing strategies</a>, new product development strategies, human resource strategies, financial strategies, legal strategies, supply-chain strategies, and information technology management strategies. The emphasis is on short and medium term plans and is limited to the domain of each department’s functional responsibility. Each functional department attempts to do its part in meeting overall corporate objectives, and hence to some extent their strategies are derived from broader corporate strategies.</p>
<p>Many companies feel that a functional organizational structure is not an efficient way to organize activities so they have <a href="/wiki/Reengineering" title="Reengineering">reengineered</a> according to processes or SBUs. A <b>strategic business unit</b> is a semi-autonomous unit that is usually responsible for its own budgeting, new product decisions, hiring decisions, and price setting.

<p>An additional level of strategy called <b>operational strategy</b> was encouraged by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Drucker" title="Peter Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> in his theory of <a href="/wiki/Management_by_objectives" title="Management by objectives">management by objectives</a> (MBO). It is very narrow in focus and deals with day-to-day operational activities such as scheduling criteria. It must operate within a budget but is not at liberty to adjust or create that budget. Operational level strategies are informed by business level strategies which, in turn, are informed by corporate level strategies.</p>
<p>Since the turn of the millennium, some firms have reverted to a simpler strategic structure driven by advances in information technology. It is felt that <a href="/wiki/Knowledge_management" title="Knowledge management">knowledge management</a> systems should be used to share information and create common goals. Strategic divisions are thought to hamper this process. This notion of strategy has been captured under the rubric of <b>dynamic strategy</b>, popularized by Carpenter and Sanders's textbook <a href="http://www.prenhall.com/carpenter/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prenhall.com/carpenter/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This work builds on that of Brown and Eisenhart as well as Christensen and portrays firm strategy, both business and corporate, as necessarily embracing ongoing strategic change, and the seamless integration of strategy formulation and implementation. Such change and implementation are usually built into the strategy through the staging and pacing facets.</p>

<p>Strategic management as a discipline originated in the 1950s and 60s. Although there were numerous early contributors to the literature, the most influential pioneers were Alfred D. Chandler, Philip Selznick, Igor Ansoff, and Peter Drucker.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Alfred_D._Chandler,_Jr." title="Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.">Alfred Chandler</a> recognized the importance of coordinating the various aspects of management under one all-encompassing strategy. Prior to this time the various functions of management were separate with little overall coordination or strategy. Interactions between functions or between departments were typically handled by a boundary position, that is, there were one or two managers that relayed information back and forth between two departments. Chandler also stressed the importance of taking a long term perspective when looking to the future. In his 1962 groundbreaking work <i>Strategy and Structure</i>, Chandler showed that a long-term coordinated strategy was necessary to give a company structure, direction, and focus. He says it concisely, “<a href="/wiki/Structure_follows_strategy" title="Structure follows strategy">structure follows strategy</a>.”<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1957, <a href="/wiki/Philip_Selznick" title="Philip Selznick">Philip Selznick</a> introduced the idea of matching the organization's internal factors with external environmental circumstances.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> This core idea was developed into what we now call <a href="/wiki/SWOT_analysis" title="SWOT analysis">SWOT analysis</a> by Learned, Andrews, and others at the Harvard Business School General Management Group. Strengths and weaknesses of the firm are assessed in light of the opportunities and threats from the business environment.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Igor_Ansoff" title="Igor Ansoff">Igor Ansoff</a> built on Chandler's work by adding a range of strategic concepts and inventing a whole new vocabulary. He developed a strategy grid that compared market penetration strategies, product development strategies, market development strategies and <a href="/wiki/Horizontal_integration" title="Horizontal integration">horizontal</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vertical_integration" title="Vertical integration">vertical integration</a> and diversification strategies. He felt that management could use these strategies to systematically prepare for future opportunities and challenges. In his 1965 classic <i>Corporate Strategy</i>, he developed the <a href="/wiki/Gap_analysis" title="Gap analysis">gap analysis</a> still used today in which we must understand the gap between where we are currently and where we would like to be, then develop what he called “gap reducing actions”.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Peter_Drucker" title="Peter Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> was a prolific strategy theorist, author of dozens of management books, with a career spanning five decades. His contributions to strategic management were many but two are most important. Firstly, he stressed the importance of objectives. An organization without clear objectives is like a ship without a rudder. As early as 1954 he was developing a theory of management based on objectives.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> This evolved into his theory of <b>management by objectives</b> (MBO). According to Drucker, the procedure of setting objectives and monitoring your progress towards them should permeate the entire organization, top to bottom. His other seminal contribution was in predicting the importance of what today we would call intellectual capital. He predicted the rise of what he called the “knowledge worker” and explained the consequences of this for management. He said that knowledge work is non-hierarchical. Work would be carried out in <a href="/wiki/Cross-functional_team" title="Cross-functional team">teams</a> with the person most knowledgeable in the task at hand being the temporary leader.</p>
<p>In 1985, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Ellen-Earle_Chaffee&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ellen-Earle Chaffee (page does not exist)">Ellen-Earle Chaffee</a> summarized what she thought were the main elements of strategic management theory by the 1970s:<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic management involves adapting the organization to its business environment.</li>
<li>Strategic management is fluid and complex. Change creates novel combinations of circumstances requiring unstructured non-repetitive responses.</li>
<li>Strategic management affects the entire organization by providing direction.</li>
<li>Strategic management involves both strategy formation (she called it content) and also strategy implementation (she called it process).</li>
<li>Strategic management is partially planned and partially unplanned.</li>
<li>Strategic management is done at several levels: overall corporate strategy, and individual business strategies.</li>
<li>Strategic management involves both conceptual and analytical thought processes.</li>

<p>In the 1970s much of strategic management dealt with size, growth, and portfolio theory. The <a href="/wiki/PIMS_study" title="PIMS study" class="mw-redirect">PIMS study</a> was a long term study, started in the 1960s and lasted for 19 years, that attempted to understand the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies (PIMS), particularly the effect of market share. Started at <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" title="General Electric">General Electric</a>, moved to Harvard in the early 1970s, and then moved to the Strategic Planning Institute in the late 1970s, it now contains decades of information on the relationship between profitability and strategy. Their initial conclusion was unambiguous: The greater a company's market share, the greater will be their rate of profit. The high market share provides volume and <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale" class="mw-redirect">economies of scale</a>. It also provides experience and <a href="/wiki/Learning_curve" title="Learning curve">learning curve</a> advantages. The combined effect is increased profits.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The studies conclusions continue to be drawn on by academics and companies today: "PIMS provides compelling quantitative evidence as to which business strategies work and don't work" - Tom Peters.</p>
<p>The benefits of high market share naturally lead to an interest in growth strategies. The relative advantages of <a href="/wiki/Horizontal_integration" title="Horizontal integration">horizontal integration</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vertical_integration" title="Vertical integration">vertical integration</a>, diversification, <a href="/wiki/Franchising" title="Franchising">franchises</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions" title="Mergers and acquisitions">mergers and acquisitions</a>, joint ventures, and organic growth were discussed. The most appropriate <a href="/wiki/Market_dominance_strategies" title="Market dominance strategies" class="mw-redirect">market dominance strategies</a> were assessed given the competitive and regulatory environment.</p>
<p>There was also research that indicated that a low market share strategy could also be very profitable. Schumacher (1973),<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Woo and Cooper (1982),<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Levenson (1984),<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> and later Traverso (2002)<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.</p>
<p>By the early 1980s the paradoxical conclusion was that high market share and low market share companies were often very profitable but most of the companies in between were not. This was sometimes called the “hole in the middle” problem. This anomaly would be explained by Michael Porter in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The management of diversified organizations required new techniques and new ways of thinking. The first CEO to address the problem of a multi-divisional company was <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Sloan" title="Alfred Sloan" class="mw-redirect">Alfred Sloan</a> at General Motors. GM was decentralized into semi-autonomous “strategic business units” (SBU's), but with centralized support functions.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable concepts in the strategic management of multi-divisional companies was <b>portfolio theory</b>. In the previous decade <a href="/wiki/Harry_Markowitz" title="Harry Markowitz">Harry Markowitz</a> and other financial theorists developed the theory of <a href="/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory" title="Modern portfolio theory">portfolio analysis</a>. It was concluded that a broad portfolio of financial assets could reduce <a href="/wiki/Specific_risk" title="Specific risk">specific risk</a>. In the 1970s marketers extended the theory to product portfolio decisions and managerial strategists extended it to operating division portfolios. Each of a company’s operating divisions were seen as an element in the corporate portfolio. Each operating division (also called strategic business units) was treated as a semi-independent profit center with its own revenues, costs, objectives, and strategies. Several techniques were developed to analyze the relationships between elements in a portfolio. <a href="/wiki/B.C.G._Analysis" title="B.C.G. Analysis" class="mw-redirect">B.C.G. Analysis</a>, for example, was developed by the <a href="/wiki/Boston_Consulting_Group" title="Boston Consulting Group">Boston Consulting Group</a> in the early 1970s. This was the theory that gave us the wonderful image of a CEO sitting on a stool milking a <b>cash cow</b>. Shortly after that the <a href="/wiki/G.E._multi_factoral_analysis" title="G.E. multi factoral analysis" class="mw-redirect">G.E. multi factoral model</a> was developed by General Electric. Companies continued to diversify until the 1980s when it was realized that in many cases a portfolio of operating divisions was worth more as separate completely independent companies.</p>

<p>The 1970s also saw the rise of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Marketing_orientation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Marketing orientation (page does not exist)">marketing oriented</a> firm. From the beginnings of capitalism it was assumed that the key requirement of business success was a <a href="/wiki/Product_(business)" title="Product (business)">product</a> of high technical quality. If you produced a product that worked well and was durable, it was assumed you would have no difficulty selling them at a profit. This was called the <a href="/wiki/Production_orientation" title="Production orientation" class="mw-redirect">production orientation</a> and it was generally true that good products could be sold without effort, encapsulated in the saying "Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door." This was largely due to the growing numbers of affluent and middle class people that capitalism had created. But after the untapped demand caused by the second world war was saturated in the 1950s it became obvious that products were not selling as easily as they had been. The answer was to concentrate on <a href="/wiki/Selling" title="Selling">selling</a>. The 1950s and 1960s is known as the sales era and the guiding <a href="/wiki/Philosophy_of_business" title="Philosophy of business">philosophy of business</a> of the time is today called the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sales_orientation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sales orientation (page does not exist)">sales orientation</a>. In the early 1970s <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Levitt" title="Theodore Levitt">Theodore Levitt</a> and others at Harvard argued that the sales orientation had things backward. They claimed that instead of producing products then trying to sell them to the customer, businesses should start with the customer, find out what they wanted, and then produce it for them. The customer became the driving force behind all strategic business decisions. This <a href="/wiki/Marketing" title="Marketing">marketing</a> orientation, in the decades since its introduction, has been reformulated and repackaged under numerous names including customer orientation, marketing philosophy, <a href="/wiki/Customer_intimacy" title="Customer intimacy">customer intimacy</a>, customer focus, customer driven, and market focused.</p>

<p>By the late 70s people had started to notice how successful Japanese industry had become. In industry after industry, including steel, watches, ship building, cameras, autos, and electronics, the Japanese were surpassing American and European companies. Westerners wanted to know why. Numerous theories purported to explain the Japanese success including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher employee morale, dedication, and loyalty;</li>
<li>Lower cost structure, including wages;</li>
<li>Effective government industrial policy;</li>
<li>Modernization after WWII leading to high capital intensity and productivity;</li>
<li>Economies of scale associated with increased exporting;</li>
<li>Relatively low value of the Yen leading to low interest rates and capital costs, low dividend expectations, and inexpensive exports;</li>
<li>Superior quality control techniques such as Total Quality Management and other systems introduced by <a href="/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming" title="W. Edwards Deming">W. Edwards Deming</a> in the 1950s and 60s.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Although there was some truth to all these potential explanations, there was clearly something missing. In fact by 1980 the Japanese cost structure was higher than the American. And post WWII reconstruction was nearly 40 years in the past. The first management theorist to suggest an explanation was Richard Pascale.</p>
<p>In 1981 <a href="/w/index.php?title=Richard_Pascale&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Richard Pascale (page does not exist)">Richard Pascale</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Anthony_Athos&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Anthony Athos (page does not exist)">Anthony Athos</a> in <i>The Art of Japanese Management</i> claimed that the main reason for Japanese success was their superior management techniques.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> They divided management into 7 aspects (which are also known as <a href="/w/index.php?title=McKinsey_7S_Framework&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="McKinsey 7S Framework (page does not exist)">McKinsey 7S Framework</a>): Strategy, Structure, Systems, Skills, Staff, Style, and Supraordinate goals (which we would now call shared values). The first three of the 7 S's were called hard factors and this is where American companies excelled. The remaining four factors (skills, staff, style, and shared values) were called soft factors and were not well understood by American businesses of the time (for details on the role of soft and hard factors see Wickens P.D. 1995.) Americans did not yet place great value on <a href="/wiki/Corporate_culture" title="Corporate culture" class="mw-redirect">corporate culture</a>, shared values and beliefs, and social cohesion in the workplace. In Japan the task of management was seen as managing the whole complex of human needs, economic, social, psychological, and spiritual. In America work was seen as something that was separate from the rest of one's life. It was quite common for Americans to exhibit a very different personality at work compared to the rest of their lives. Pascale also highlighted the difference between decision making styles; hierarchical in America, and consensus in Japan. He also claimed that American business lacked long term vision, preferring instead to apply management fads and theories in a piecemeal fashion.</p>
<p>One year later <i>The Mind of the Strategist</i> was released in America by <a href="/wiki/Kenichi_Ohmae" title="Kenichi Ohmae">Kenichi Ohmae</a>, the head of <a href="/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Co." title="McKinsey &amp; Co." class="mw-redirect">McKinsey &amp; Co.</a>'s Tokyo office.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> (It was originally published in Japan in 1975.) He claimed that strategy in America was too analytical. Strategy should be a creative art: It is a frame of mind that requires intuition and intellectual flexibility. He claimed that Americans constrained their strategic options by thinking in terms of analytical techniques, rote formula, and step-by-step processes. He compared the culture of Japan in which vagueness, ambiguity, and tentative decisions were acceptable, to American culture that valued fast decisions.</p>
<p>Also in 1982 <a href="/wiki/Tom_Peters" title="Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> and Robert Waterman released a study that would respond to the Japanese challenge head on.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Peters and Waterman, who had several years earlier collaborated with Pascale and Athos at <a href="/wiki/McKinsey_%26_Co." title="McKinsey &amp; Co." class="mw-redirect">McKinsey &amp; Co.</a> asked “What makes an excellent company?”. They looked at 62 companies that they thought were fairly successful. Each was subject to six performance criteria. To be classified as an excellent company, it had to be above the 50th percentile in 4 of the 6 performance metrics for 20 consecutive years. Forty-three companies passed the test. They then studied these successful companies and interviewed key executives. They concluded in <i>In Search of Excellence</i> that there were 8 keys to excellence that were shared by all 43 firms. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bias for action — Do it. Try it. Don’t waste time studying it with multiple reports and committees.</li>
<li>Customer focus — Get close to the customer. <a href="/wiki/Know_your_customer" title="Know your customer">Know your customer</a>.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship — Even big companies act and think small by giving people the authority to take initiatives.</li>
<li>Productivity through people — Treat your people with respect and they will reward you with productivity.</li>
<li>Value-oriented CEOs — The CEO should actively propagate corporate values throughout the organization.</li>
<li>Stick to the knitting — Do what you know well.</li>
<li>Keep things simple and lean — Complexity encourages waste and confusion.</li>
<li>Simultaneously centralized and decentralized — Have tight centralized control while also allowing maximum individual autonomy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic blueprint on how to compete against the Japanese had been drawn. But as <a href="/w/index.php?title=J.E._Rehfeld&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="J.E. Rehfeld (page does not exist)">J.E. Rehfeld</a> (1994) explains it is not a straight forward task due to differences in culture.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> A certain type of alchemy was required to transform knowledge from various cultures into a management style that allows a specific company to compete in a globally diverse world. He says, for example, that Japanese style <a href="/wiki/Kaizen" title="Kaizen">kaizen</a> (continuous improvement) techniques, although suitable for people socialized in Japanese culture, have not been successful when implemented in the U.S. unless they are modified significantly.</p>
<p>In 2009, industry consultants Mark Blaxill and Ralph Eckardt suggested that much of the Japanese business dominance that began in the mid 1970s was the direct result of competition enforcement efforts by the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission" title="Federal Trade Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) and <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Justice" title="U.S. Department of Justice" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Department of Justice</a> (DOJ). In 1975 the FTC reached a settlement with Xerox Corporation in its anti-trust lawsuit. (At the time, the FTC was under the direction of <a href="/wiki/Frederic_M._Scherer" title="Frederic M. Scherer">Frederic M. Scherer</a>). The 1975 Xerox <a href="/wiki/Consent_decree" title="Consent decree">consent decree</a> forced the licensing of the company’s entire <a href="/wiki/Patent" title="Patent">patent</a> portfolio, mainly to Japanese competitors. (See "<a href="/wiki/Compulsory_license" title="Compulsory license">compulsory license</a>".) This action marked the start of an activist approach to managing competition by the FTC and DOJ, which resulted in the compulsory licensing of tens of thousands of patent from some of America's leading companies, including <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="/wiki/AT%26T" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a>, <a href="/wiki/DuPont" title="DuPont">DuPont</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bausch_%26_Lomb" title="Bausch &amp; Lomb">Bausch &amp; Lomb</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Eastman_Kodak" title="Eastman Kodak">Eastman Kodak</a>.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may be based upon unreliable original research&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research?</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Within four years of the consent decree, Xerox's share of the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Copier" title="Copier" class="mw-redirect">copier</a> market dropped from nearly 100% to less than 14%. Between 1950 and 1980 Japanese companies consummated more than 35,000 foreign licensing agreements, mostly with U.S. companies, for free or low-cost licenses made possible by the FTC and DOJ. The post-1975 era of anti-trust initiatives by Washington D.C. economists at the FTC corresponded directly with the rapid, unprecedented rise in Japanese competitiveness and a simultaneous stalling of the U.S. manufacturing economy. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The Japanese challenge shook the confidence of the western business elite, but detailed comparisons of the two management styles and examinations of successful businesses convinced westerners that they could overcome the challenge. The 1980s and early 1990s saw a plethora of theories explaining exactly how this could be done. They cannot all be detailed here, but some of the more important strategic advances of the decade are explained below.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Gary_Hamel" title="Gary Hamel">Gary Hamel</a> and <a href="/wiki/C._K._Prahalad" title="C. K. Prahalad">C. K. Prahalad</a> declared that strategy needs to be more active and interactive; less “arm-chair planning” was needed. They introduced terms like <b>strategic intent</b> and <b>strategic architecture</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Their most well known advance was the idea of <a href="/wiki/Core_competency" title="Core competency">core competency</a>.

<p>Active strategic management required active information gathering and active problem solving. In the early days of Hewlett-Packard (H-P), <a href="/wiki/Dave_Packard" title="Dave Packard" class="mw-redirect">Dave Packard</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Hewlett" title="Bill Hewlett" class="mw-redirect">Bill Hewlett</a> devised an active management style that they called <b>Management By Walking Around</b> (MBWA). Senior H-P managers were seldom at their desks. They spent most of their days visiting employees, customers, and suppliers. This direct contact with key people provided them with a solid grounding from which viable strategies could be crafted. The MBWA concept was popularized in 1985 by a book by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Peters" title="Tom Peters">Tom Peters</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nancy_Austin" title="Nancy Austin">Nancy Austin</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Japanese managers employ a similar system, which originated at Honda, and is sometimes called the 3 G's (Genba, Genbutsu, and Genjitsu, which translate into “actual place”, “actual thing”, and “actual situation”).</p>
<p>Probably the most influential strategist of the decade was <a href="/wiki/Michael_Porter" title="Michael Porter">Michael Porter</a>. He introduced many new concepts including; 5 forces analysis, generic strategies, the value chain, strategic groups, and <a href="/wiki/Porter%27s_cluster" title="Porter's cluster" class="mw-redirect">clusters</a>. In <a href="/wiki/Porter_5_forces_analysis" title="Porter 5 forces analysis" class="mw-redirect">5 forces analysis</a> he identifies the forces that shape a firm's strategic environment. It is like a <a href="/wiki/SWOT_analysis" title="SWOT analysis">SWOT analysis</a> with structure and purpose. It shows how a firm can use these forces to obtain a <a href="/wiki/Sustainable_competitive_advantage" title="Sustainable competitive advantage" class="mw-redirect">sustainable competitive advantage</a>. Porter modifies Chandler's dictum about structure following strategy by introducing a second level of structure: Organizational structure follows strategy, which in turn follows industry structure. Porter's <a href="/wiki/Porter_generic_strategies" title="Porter generic strategies">generic strategies</a> detail the interaction between <b>cost minimization strategies</b>, <b>product differentiation strategies</b>, and <b>market focus strategies</b>. Although he did not introduce these terms, he showed the importance of choosing one of them rather than trying to position your company between them. He also challenged managers to see their industry in terms of a <a href="/wiki/Value_chain" title="Value chain">value chain</a>. A firm will be successful only to the extent that it contributes to the industry's value chain. This forced management to look at its operations from the customer's point of view. Every operation should be examined in terms of what value it adds in the eyes of the final customer.</p>
<p>In 1993, <a href="/wiki/John_Kay_(economist)" title="John Kay (economist)">John Kay</a> took the idea of the value chain to a financial level claiming “ Adding value is the central purpose of business activity”, where adding value is defined as the difference between the market value of outputs and the cost of inputs including capital, all divided by the firm's net output. Borrowing from Gary Hamel and Michael Porter, Kay claims that the role of strategic management is to identify your core competencies, and then assemble a collection of assets that will increase value added and provide a competitive advantage. He claims that there are 3 types of capabilities that can do this; innovation, reputation, and organizational structure.</p>
<p>The 1980s also saw the widespread acceptance of <a href="/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)" title="Positioning (marketing)">positioning theory</a>. Although the theory originated with <a href="/wiki/Jack_Trout" title="Jack Trout">Jack Trout</a> in 1969, it didn’t gain wide acceptance until <a href="/wiki/Al_Ries" title="Al Ries">Al Ries</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jack_Trout" title="Jack Trout">Jack Trout</a> wrote their classic book “Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind” (1979). The basic premise is that a strategy should not be judged by internal company factors but by the way customers see it relative to the competition. Crafting and implementing a strategy involves creating a position in the mind of the collective consumer. Several techniques were applied to positioning theory, some newly invented but most borrowed from other disciplines. <a href="/wiki/Perceptual_mapping" title="Perceptual mapping">Perceptual mapping</a> for example, creates visual displays of the relationships between positions. <a href="/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling_(in_marketing)" title="Multidimensional scaling (in marketing)" class="mw-redirect">Multidimensional scaling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Discriminant_analysis_(in_marketing)" title="Discriminant analysis (in marketing)" class="mw-redirect">discriminant analysis</a>, <a href="/wiki/Factor_analysis" title="Factor analysis">factor analysis</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Conjoint_analysis_(in_marketing)" title="Conjoint analysis (in marketing)">conjoint analysis</a> are mathematical techniques used to determine the most relevant characteristics (called dimensions or factors) upon which positions should be based. <a href="/wiki/Preference_regression_(in_marketing)" title="Preference regression (in marketing)">Preference regression</a> can be used to determine vectors of ideal positions and <a href="/wiki/Cluster_analysis_(in_marketing)" title="Cluster analysis (in marketing)">cluster analysis</a> can identify clusters of positions.</p>
<p>Others felt that internal company resources were the key. In 1992, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jay_Barney&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jay Barney (page does not exist)">Jay Barney</a>, for example, saw strategy as assembling the optimum mix of resources, including human, technology, and suppliers, and then configure them in unique and sustainable ways.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Michael_Hammer" title="Michael Hammer">Michael Hammer</a> and <a href="/wiki/James_Champy" title="James Champy" class="mw-redirect">James Champy</a> felt that these resources needed to be restructured.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> This process, that they labeled <a href="/wiki/Reengineering" title="Reengineering">reengineering</a>, involved organizing a firm's assets around whole processes rather than tasks. In this way a team of people saw a project through, from inception to completion. This avoided functional silos where isolated departments seldom talked to each other. It also eliminated waste due to functional overlap and interdepartmental communications.</p>
<p>In 1989 <a href="/wiki/Richard_Lester" title="Richard Lester">Richard Lester</a> and the researchers at the MIT Industrial Performance Center identified seven <b>best practices</b> and concluded that firms must accelerate the shift away from the mass production of low cost standardized products. The seven areas of best practice were:<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneous continuous improvement in cost, quality, service, and product innovation</li>
<li>Breaking down organizational barriers between departments</li>
<li>Eliminating layers of management creating flatter organizational hierarchies.</li>
<li>Closer relationships with customers and suppliers</li>
<li>Intelligent use of new technology</li>
<li>Global focus</li>
<li>Improving human resource skills</li>
</ul>
<p>The search for “best practices” is also called <a href="/wiki/Benchmarking" title="Benchmarking">benchmarking</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> This involves determining where you need to improve, finding an organization that is exceptional in this area, then studying the company and applying its best practices in your firm.</p>
<p>A large group of theorists felt the area where western business was most lacking was product quality. People like <a href="/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming" title="W. Edwards Deming">W.

<p>An equally large group of theorists felt that poor customer service was the problem. People like James Heskett (1988),<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> Earl Sasser (1995), William Davidow,<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> Len Schlesinger,<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> A.

Their underlying assumption was that there is no better source of competitive advantage than a continuous stream of delighted customers.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Process_management" title="Process management">Process management</a> uses some of the techniques from product quality management and some of the techniques from customer service management. It looks at an activity as a sequential process. The objective is to find inefficiencies and make the process more effective. Although the procedures have a long history, dating back to <a href="/wiki/Taylorism" title="Taylorism" class="mw-redirect">Taylorism</a>, the scope of their applicability has been greatly widened, leaving no aspect of the firm free from potential process improvements. Because of the broad applicability of process management techniques, they can be used as a basis for competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Some realized that businesses were spending much more on acquiring new customers than on retaining current ones. Carl Sewell,<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Frederick_F._Reichheld" title="Frederick F.

This has come to be known as <b>the loyalty effect</b> after Reicheld's book of the same name in which he broadens the concept to include employee loyalty, supplier loyalty, distributor loyalty, and shareholder loyalty. They also developed techniques for estimating the lifetime value of a loyal customer, called <a href="/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value" title="Customer lifetime value">customer lifetime value</a> (CLV). A significant movement started that attempted to recast selling and marketing techniques into a long term endeavor that created a sustained relationship with customers (called relationship selling, <a href="/wiki/Relationship_marketing" title="Relationship marketing">relationship marketing</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Customer_relationship_management" title="Customer relationship management">customer relationship management</a>). Customer relationship management (CRM) software (and its many variants) became an integral tool that sustained this trend.</p>
<p>James Gilmore and Joseph Pine found competitive advantage in <a href="/wiki/Mass_customization" title="Mass customization">mass customization</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> Flexible manufacturing techniques allowed businesses to individualize products for each customer without losing <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale" class="mw-redirect">economies of scale</a>. This effectively turned the product into a service. They also realized that if a service is mass customized by creating a “performance” for each individual client, that service would be transformed into an “experience”. Their book, <i>The Experience Economy</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> along with the work of <a href="/wiki/Bernd_Schmitt" title="Bernd Schmitt">Bernd Schmitt</a> convinced many to see service provision as a form of theatre. This school of thought is sometimes referred to as <a href="/wiki/Customer_experience_management" title="Customer experience management" class="mw-redirect">customer experience management</a> (CEM).</p>
<p>Like Peters and Waterman a decade earlier, <a href="/wiki/James_Collins_(management_theorist)" title="James Collins (management theorist)" class="mw-redirect">James Collins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jerry_Porras" title="Jerry Porras" class="mw-redirect">Jerry Porras</a> spent years conducting empirical research on what makes great companies. Six years of research uncovered a key underlying principle behind the 19 successful companies that they studied: They all encourage and preserve a <b>core ideology</b> that nurtures the company. Even though strategy and tactics change daily, the companies, nevertheless, were able to maintain a core set of values. These core values encourage employees to build an organization that lasts. In <i>Built To Last</i> (1994) they claim that short term profit goals, cost cutting, and restructuring will not stimulate dedicated employees to build a great company that will endure.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> In 2000 Collins coined the term “built to flip” to describe the prevailing business attitudes in Silicon Valley. It describes a business culture where technological change inhibits a long term focus. He also popularized the concept of the <b>BHAG</b> (Big Hairy Audacious Goal).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Arie_de_Geus" title="Arie de Geus">Arie de Geus</a> (1997) undertook a similar study and obtained similar results. He identified four key traits of companies that had prospered for 50 years or more. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity to the business environment — the ability to learn and adjust</li>
<li>Cohesion and identity — the ability to build a community with personality, vision, and purpose</li>
<li>Tolerance and decentralization — the ability to build relationships</li>
<li>Conservative financing</li>
</ul>
<p>A company with these key characteristics he called a <b>living company</b> because it is able to perpetuate itself. If a company emphasizes knowledge rather than finance, and sees itself as an ongoing community of human beings, it has the potential to become great and endure for decades. Such an organization is an organic entity capable of learning (he called it a “learning organization”) and capable of creating its own processes, goals, and persona.</p>

<p>The marketing warfare literature also examined leadership and motivation, intelligence gathering, types of marketing weapons, logistics, and communications.</p>
<p>By the turn of the century marketing warfare strategies had gone out of favour. It was felt that they were limiting. There were many situations in which non-confrontational approaches were more appropriate. The “Strategy of the Dolphin” was developed in the mid 1990s to give guidance as to when to use aggressive strategies and when to use passive strategies. A variety of <a href="/wiki/Aggressiveness_strategies_(business)" title="Aggressiveness strategies (business)">aggressiveness strategies</a> were developed.</p>

<p>In 1970, <a href="/wiki/Alvin_Toffler" title="Alvin Toffler">Alvin Toffler</a> in <i>Future Shock</i> described a trend towards accelerating rates of change.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45" title=""><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> He illustrated how social and technological norms had shorter lifespans with each generation, and he questioned society's ability to cope with the resulting turmoil and anxiety. In past generations periods of change were always punctuated with times of stability. This allowed society to assimilate the change and deal with it before the next change arrived. But these periods of stability are getting shorter and by the late 20th century had all but disappeared. In 1980 in <i>The Third Wave</i>, Toffler characterized this shift to relentless change as the defining feature of the third phase of civilization (the first two phases being the agricultural and industrial waves).<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46" title=""><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> He claimed that the dawn of this new phase will cause great anxiety for those that grew up in the previous phases, and will cause much conflict and opportunity in the business world. Hundreds of authors, particularly since the early 1990s, have attempted to explain what this means for business strategy.</p>
<p>In 1997, Watts Waker and Jim Taylor called this upheaval a "500 year delta."<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47" title=""><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> They claimed these major upheavals occur every 5 centuries.

<p>In 1968, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Drucker" title="Peter Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> (1969) coined the phrase <b>Age of Discontinuity</b> to describe the way change forces disruptions into the continuity of our lives.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> In an age of continuity attempts to predict the future by extrapolating from the past can be somewhat accurate.

<p>In 1988, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Mintzberg" title="Henry Mintzberg">Henry Mintzberg</a> looked at the changing world around him and decided it was time to reexamine how strategic management was done.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64" title=""><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> He examined the strategic process and concluded it was much more fluid and unpredictable than people had thought. Because of this, he could not point to one process that could be called <a href="/wiki/Strategic_planning" title="Strategic planning">strategic planning</a>. Instead he concludes that there are five types of strategies. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy as plan - a direction, guide, course of action - intention rather than actual</li>
<li>Strategy as ploy - a maneuver intended to outwit a competitor</li>
<li>Strategy as pattern - a consistent pattern of past behaviour - realized rather than intended</li>
<li>Strategy as position - locating of brands, products, or companies within the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders - strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm</li>
<li>Strategy as perspective - strategy determined primarily by a master strategist</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1998, Mintzberg developed these five types of management strategy into 10 “schools of thought”. These 10 schools are grouped into three categories. The first group is prescriptive or normative. It consists of the informal design and conception school, the formal planning school, and the analytical positioning school. The second group, consisting of six schools, is more concerned with how strategic management is actually done, rather than prescribing optimal plans or positions. The six schools are the entrepreneurial, visionary, or great leader school, the cognitive or mental process school, the learning, adaptive, or emergent process school, the power or negotiation school, the corporate culture or collective process school, and the business environment or reactive school. The third and final group consists of one school, the configuration or transformation school, an hybrid of the other schools organized into stages, organizational life cycles, or “episodes”.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65" title=""><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, Constantinos Markides also wanted to reexamine the nature of strategic planning itself.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66" title=""><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> He describes strategy formation and implementation as an on-going, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and reformation. Strategic management is planned and emergent, dynamic, and interactive. J. Moncrieff (1999) also stresses <a href="/wiki/Strategy_dynamics" title="Strategy dynamics">strategy dynamics</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67" title=""><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> He recognized that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned. The unplanned element comes from two sources: <b>emergent strategies</b> (result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment) and <b>Strategies in action</b> (ad hoc actions by many people from all parts of the organization).</p>
<p>Some business planners are starting to use a <a href="/wiki/Complexity_theory_approach_to_strategy" title="Complexity theory approach to strategy" class="mw-redirect">complexity theory approach to strategy</a>. Complexity can be thought of as chaos with a dash of order. <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">Chaos theory</a> deals with turbulent systems that rapidly become disordered. Complexity is not quite so unpredictable. It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear. Axelrod, R.,<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68" title=""><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup> Holland, J.,<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69" title=""><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup> and Kelly, S. and Allison, M.A.,<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70" title=""><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup> call these systems of multiple actions and reactions <b>complex adaptive systems</b>. Axelrod asserts that rather than fear complexity, business should harness it. He says this can best be done when “there are many participants, numerous interactions, much trial and error learning, and abundant attempts to imitate each others' successes”. In 2000, E. Dudik wrote that an organization must develop a mechanism for understanding the source and level of complexity it will face in the future and then transform itself into a complex adaptive system in order to deal with it.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71" title=""><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Peter_Drucker" title="Peter Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> had theorized the rise of the “knowledge worker” back in the 1950s. He described how fewer workers would be doing physical labor, and more would be applying their minds. In 1984, <a href="/wiki/John_Nesbitt" title="John Nesbitt">John Nesbitt</a> theorized that the future would be driven largely by information: companies that managed information well could obtain an advantage, however the profitability of what he calls the “information float” (information that the company had and others desired) would all but disappear as inexpensive computers made information more accessible.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Daniel_Bell" title="Daniel Bell">Daniel Bell</a> (1985) examined the sociological consequences of information technology, while Gloria Schuck and Shoshana Zuboff looked at psychological factors.<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72" title=""><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup> Zuboff, in her five year study of eight pioneering corporations made the important distinction between “automating technologies” and “infomating technologies”. She studied the effect that both had on individual workers, managers, and organizational structures. She largely confirmed Peter Drucker's predictions three decades earlier, about the importance of flexible decentralized structure, work teams, knowledge sharing, and the central role of the knowledge worker. Zuboff also detected a new basis for managerial authority, based not on position or hierarchy, but on knowledge (also predicted by Drucker) which she called “participative management”.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73" title=""><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1990, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Senge" title="Peter Senge">Peter Senge</a>, who had collaborated with Arie de Geus at Dutch Shell, borrowed de Geus' notion of the <b>learning organization</b>, expanded it, and popularized it. The underlying theory is that a company's ability to gather, analyze, and use information is a necessary requirement for business success in the information age. (See <a href="/wiki/Organizational_learning" title="Organizational learning">organizational learning</a>.) In order to do this, Senge claimed that an organization would need to be structured such that:<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74" title=""><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>People can continuously expand their capacity to learn and be productive,</li>
<li>New patterns of thinking are nurtured,</li>
<li>Collective aspirations are encouraged, and</li>
<li>People are encouraged to see the “whole picture” together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Senge identified five disciplines of a learning organization. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal responsibility, self reliance, and mastery — We accept that we are the masters of our own destiny. We make decisions and live with the consequences of them. When a problem needs to be fixed, or an opportunity exploited, we take the initiative to learn the required skills to get it done.</li>
<li>Mental models — We need to explore our personal mental models to understand the subtle effect they have on our behaviour.</li>
<li>Shared vision — The vision of where we want to be in the future is discussed and communicated to all. It provides guidance and energy for the journey ahead.</li>
<li>Team learning — We learn together in teams. This involves a shift from “a spirit of advocacy to a spirit of enquiry”.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Systems_thinking" title="Systems thinking">Systems thinking</a> — We look at the whole rather than the parts. This is what Senge calls the “Fifth discipline”. It is the glue that integrates the other four into a coherent strategy. For an alternative approach to the “learning organization”, see Garratt, B. (1987).</li>

<p><a href="/wiki/Thomas_A._Stewart" title="Thomas A. Stewart">Thomas A. Stewart</a>, for example, uses the term <b>intellectual capital</b> to describe the investment an organization makes in knowledge. It is composed of human capital (the knowledge inside the heads of employees), customer capital (the knowledge inside the heads of customers that decide to buy from you), and structural capital (the knowledge that resides in the company itself).</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Manuel_Castells" title="Manuel Castells">Manuel Castells</a>, describes a <b>network society</b> characterized by: globalization, organizations structured as a network, instability of employment, and a social divide between those with access to information technology and those without.</p>
<p>Stan Davis and Christopher Meyer (1998) have combined three variables to define what they call the <b>BLUR equation</b>. The speed of change, Internet connectivity, and intangible knowledge value, when multiplied together yields a society's rate of BLUR. The three variables interact and reinforce each other making this relationship highly non-linear.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Regis_McKenna" title="Regis McKenna">Regis McKenna</a> posits that life in the high tech information age is what he called a “real time experience”. Events occur in real time.

<p><a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Moore" title="Geoffrey Moore">Geoffrey Moore</a> (1991) and R. Frank and P. Cook<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85" title=""><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup> also detected a shift in the nature of competition. In industries with high technology content, technical standards become established and this gives the dominant firm a near monopoly. The same is true of networked industries in which <a href="/wiki/Interoperability" title="Interoperability">interoperability</a> requires compatibility between users. An example is word processor documents. Once a product has gained market dominance, other products, even far superior products, cannot compete. Moore showed how firms could attain this enviable position by using E.M. Rogers five stage <a href="/wiki/Diffusion_(business)" title="Diffusion (business)">adoption process</a> and focusing on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries and pragmatists (See <a href="/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm" title="Crossing the Chasm">Crossing the Chasm</a>). If successful a firm can create a bandwagon effect in which the momentum builds and your product becomes a de facto standard.</p>
<p>Evans and Wurster describe how industries with a high information component are being transformed.<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86" title=""><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup> They cite Encarta's demolition of the <a href="/wiki/Encyclopedia_Britannica" title="Encyclopedia Britannica" class="mw-redirect">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> (whose sales have plummeted 80% since their peak of $650 million in 1990). Many speculate that Encarta’s reign will be short-lived, eclipsed by collaborative encyclopedias like Wikipedia that can operate at very low marginal costs. Evans also mentions the music industry which is desperately looking for a new <a href="/wiki/Business_model" title="Business model">business model</a>. The upstart information savvy firms, unburdened by cumbersome physical assets, are changing the competitive landscape, redefining market segments, and <a href="/wiki/Disintermediation" title="Disintermediation">disintermediating</a> some channels.

<p>Access to information systems have allowed senior managers to take a much more comprehensive view of strategic management than ever before. The most notable of the comprehensive systems is the <a href="/wiki/Balanced_scorecard" title="Balanced scorecard">balanced scorecard</a> approach developed in the early 1990s by Drs. <a href="/wiki/Robert_S._Kaplan" title="Robert S.

<p>In 2009, Mark Blaxill and Ralph Eckardt suggested that in a <a href="/wiki/Knowledge_economy" title="Knowledge economy">knowledge economy</a> all business strategy boils down to <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> (IP) strategy.</p>
<p>By contrast, most current approaches to business "strategy" focus on the mechanics of management -- e.g., Drucker's operational "strategies" -- and as such are not true business strategy. In a <a href="/wiki/Post-industrial" title="Post-industrial" class="mw-redirect">post-industrial</a> world these operationally focused business strategies hinge on conventional sources of advantage have essentially been eliminated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale used to be very important. But now, with access to capital and a global marketplace, scale is achievable by multiple organizations simultaneously. In many cases, it can literally be rented.</li>
<li>Process improvement or “<a href="/wiki/Best_practices" title="Best practices" class="mw-redirect">best practices</a>” were once a favored source of advantage, but they were at best temporary, as they could be copied and adapted by competitors.</li>
<li>Owning the customer had always been thought of as an important form of competitive advantage. Now, however, <a href="/wiki/Customer_loyalty" title="Customer loyalty" class="mw-redirect">customer loyalty</a> is far less important and difficult to maintain as new brands and products emerge all the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In such a world, <a href="/wiki/Differentiation" title="Differentiation">differentiation</a>, as elicudated by Michael Porter, is the only way to maintain economic or market superiority (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Comparative_advantage" title="Comparative advantage">comparative advantage</a>) over competitors. A company must OWN the thing that differentitates it from competitors. Without IP ownership and protection, any product, process or scale advantage can be compromised or entirely lost. Competitors can copy them without fear of economic or legal consequences, thereby eliminating the advantage.</p>

<p>Several psychologists have conducted studies to determine the psychological patterns involved in strategic management. Typically senior managers have been asked how they go about making strategic decisions. A 1938 treatise by <a href="/wiki/Chester_Barnard" title="Chester Barnard">Chester Barnard</a>, that was based on his own experience as a business executive, sees the process as informal, intuitive, non-routinized, and involving primarily oral, 2-way communications. Bernard says “The process is the sensing of the organization as a whole and the total situation relevant to it. It transcends the capacity of merely intellectual methods, and the techniques of discriminating the factors of the situation. The terms pertinent to it are “feeling”, “judgement”, “sense”, “proportion”, “balance”, “appropriateness”. It is a matter of art rather than science.”<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87" title=""><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1973, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Mintzberg" title="Henry Mintzberg">Henry Mintzberg</a> found that senior managers typically deal with unpredictable situations so they strategize in <i>ad hoc</i>, flexible, dynamic, and implicit ways. He says, “The job breeds adaptive information-manipulators who prefer the live concrete situation. The manager works in an environment of stimulous-response, and he develops in his work a clear preference for live action.”<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88" title=""><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1982, <a href="/wiki/John_Kotter" title="John Kotter">John Kotter</a> studied the daily activities of 15 executives and concluded that they spent most of their time developing and working a network of relationships from which they gained general insights and specific details to be used in making strategic decisions. They tended to use “mental road maps” rather than systematic planning techniques.<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89" title=""><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff" title="Shoshana Zuboff">Shoshana Zuboff</a> (1988) claims that information technology is widening the divide between senior managers (who typically make strategic decisions) and operational level managers (who typically make routine decisions). She claims that prior to the widespread use of computer systems, managers, even at the most senior level, engaged in both strategic decisions and routine administration, but as computers facilitated (She called it “deskilled”) routine processes, these activities were moved further down the hierarchy, leaving senior management free for strategic decions making.</p>
<p>In 1977, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Abraham_Zaleznik&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Abraham Zaleznik (page does not exist)">Abraham Zaleznik</a> identified a difference between leaders and managers.

<p>According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats,<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94" title=""><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> strategic decision making in organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They have developed a model of parallel strategic decision making.

The individual and organizational processes are not independent however. They interact at each stage of the process.</p>

<p>Although a sense of direction is important, it can also stifle creativity, especially if it is rigidly enforced. In an uncertain and ambiguous world, fluidity can be more important than a finely tuned strategic compass. When a strategy becomes internalized into a corporate culture, it can lead to <a href="/wiki/Group_think" title="Group think" class="mw-redirect">group think</a>. It can also cause an organization to define itself too narrowly. An example of this is <a href="/wiki/Marketing_myopia" title="Marketing myopia">marketing myopia</a>.</p>
<p>Many theories of strategic management tend to undergo only brief periods of popularity. A summary of these theories thus inevitably exhibits survivorship <a href="/wiki/Systemic_bias" title="Systemic bias">bias</a> (itself an area of research in strategic management). Many theories tend either to be too narrow in focus to build a complete corporate strategy on, or too general and abstract to be applicable to specific situations.

<p>In 2000, Gary Hamel coined the term <b>strategic convergence</b> to explain the limited scope of the strategies being used by rivals in greatly differing circumstances. He lamented that strategies converge more than they should, because the more successful ones get imitated by firms that do not understand that the strategic process involves designing a custom strategy for the specifics of each situation.<sup id="cite_ref-Hamel.2C_Gary_2002_50-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hamel.2C_Gary_2002-50" title=""><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>It is tempting to think that the elements of strategic management – (i) reaching consensus on corporate objectives; (ii) developing a plan for achieving the objectives; and (iii) marshalling and allocating the resources required to implement the plan – can be approached sequentially. It would be convenient, in other words, if one could deal first with the noble question of ends, and then address the mundane question of means.</p>
<p>But in the world in which strategies have to be implemented, the three elements are interdependent. Means are as likely to determine ends as ends are to determine means.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95" title=""><span>[</span>96<span>]</span></a></sup> The objectives that an organization might wish to pursue are limited by the range of feasible approaches to implementation. (There will usually be only a small number of approaches that will not only be technically and administratively possible, but also satisfactory to the full range of organizational stakeholders.) In turn, the range of feasible implementation approaches is determined by the availability of resources.</p>
<p>And so, although participants in a typical “strategy session” may be asked to do “blue sky” thinking where they pretend that the usual constraints – resources, acceptability to stakeholders , administrative feasibility – have been lifted, the fact is that it rarely makes sense to divorce oneself from the environment in which a strategy will have to be implemented. It’s probably impossible to think in any meaningful way about strategy in an unconstrained environment. Our brains can’t process “boundless possibilities”, and the very idea of strategy only has meaning in the context of challenges or obstacles to be overcome. It’s at least as plausible to argue that acute awareness of constraints is the very thing that stimulates creativity by forcing us to constantly reassess both means and ends in light of circumstances.</p>
<p>The key question, then, is, "How can individuals, organizations and societies cope as well as possible with ... issues too complex to be fully understood, given the fact that actions initiated on the basis of inadequate understanding may lead to significant regret?"<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96" title=""><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The answer is that the process of developing organizational strategy must be iterative. It involves toggling back and forth between questions about objectives, implementation planning and resources. An initial idea about corporate objectives may have to be altered if there is no feasible implementation plan that will meet with a sufficient level of acceptance among the full range of stakeholders, or because the necessary resources are not available, or both.</p>
<p>Even the most talented manager would no doubt agree that "comprehensive analysis is impossible" for complex problems<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97" title=""><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup>. Formulation and implementation of strategy must thus occur side-by-side rather than sequentially, because strategies are built on assumptions which, in the absence of perfect knowledge, will never be perfectly correct. Strategic management is necessarily a "repetitive learning cycle [rather than] a linear progression towards a clearly defined final destination."<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98" title=""><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup> While assumptions can and should be tested in advance, the ultimate test is implementation. You will inevitably need to adjust corporate objectives and/or your approach to pursuing outcomes and/or assumptions about required resources. Thus a strategy will get remade during implementation because "humans rarely can proceed satisfactorily except by learning from experience; and modest probes, serially modified on the basis of feedback, usually are the best method for such learning."<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99" title=""><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>It serves little purpose (other than to provide a false aura of certainty sometimes demanded by corporate strategists and planners) to pretend to anticipate every possible consequence of a corporate decision, every possible constraining or enabling factor, and every possible point of view. At the end of the day, what matters for the purposes of strategic management is having a clear view – based on the best available evidence and on defensible assumptions – of what it seems possible to accomplish within the constraints of a given set of circumstances. As the situation changes, some opportunities for pursuing objectives will disappear and others arise. Some implementation approaches will become impossible, while others, previously impossible or unimagined, will become viable.</p>
<p>The essence of being “strategic” thus lies in a capacity for "intelligent trial-and error"<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100" title=""><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup> rather than linear adherence to finally honed and detailed strategic plans. Strategic management will add little value -- indeed, it may well do harm -- if organizational strategies are designed to be used as a detailed blueprints for managers. Strategy should be seen, rather, as laying out the general path - but not the precise steps - by which an organization intends to create value.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101" title=""><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup>Strategic management is a question of interpreting, and continuously reinterpreting, the possibilities presented by shifting circumstances for advancing an organization's objectives. Doing so requires strategists to think <i>simultaneously</i> about desired objectives, the best approach for achieving them, and the resources implied by the chosen approach. It requires a frame of mind that admits of no boundary between means and ends.</p>

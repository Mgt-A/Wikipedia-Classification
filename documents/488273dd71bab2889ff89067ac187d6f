But their <a href="/wiki/PhD" title="PhD" class="mw-redirect">PhDs</a> don't help them interact with people, especially women. All this begins to change when a free-spirited, newly single beauty named Penny moves in next door. When Leonard and Sheldon meet Penny, Leonard is immediately interested in her (saying "our babies will be smart and beautiful"), but Sheldon feels his friend is chasing a dream he'll never catch (adding "not to mention imaginary"). Sheldon is quite content to spend his nights playing <a href="/wiki/Klingon_language" title="Klingon language">Klingon</a> <a href="/wiki/Boggle" title="Boggle">Boggle</a> with their socially dysfunctional friends, fellow geeky <a href="/wiki/Caltech" title="Caltech" class="mw-redirect">Caltech</a> geniuses, Wolowitz (a wannabe ladies man) and Koothrappali (who is so shy he can not speak to women). However, Leonard sees in Penny a whole new universe of possibilities... including love. Leonard is so infatuated with Penny that after letting her use their shower (hers was broken) he agrees to try to retrieve her TV from her ex-boyfriend, Kurt. Leonard's efforts fail when he and Sheldon, who unwillingly accompanied him, are both <a href="/wiki/Debagging" title="Debagging">depantsed</a> and left empty handed. Feeling bad, Penny offers to buy them and their friends dinner.&#160;</td>

<p>Sheldon and Leonard go over to Penny's apartment to drop off a package that came for her. Sheldon is deeply disturbed when he sees how messy and disorganized her apartment appears. Later that night, when Leonard is sleeping, Sheldon sneaks into Penny's apartment to clean and organize it. Leonard catches him and tries to stop him, but Sheldon is obsessed. The next morning, Penny yells at them, prompting Leonard to ask how she knew (Sheldon had left an organizational diagram for her closet). Sheldon goes to apologize but Penny can not believe his attitude and remains upset. Later on Leonard goes to apologize, prompting Penny to hug him and say 'we're okay'.</p>

<p>When Leonard sees Penny kissing a guy in front of her apartment door, he is devastated thinking she has 'rejected' him. The guys convince him to ask someone out at work, but when he tries and is brutally turned down by a geeky girl scientist named <a href="/wiki/List_of_characters_from_The_Big_Bang_Theory#Leslie_Winkle" title="List of characters from The Big Bang Theory" class="mw-redirect">Leslie Winkle</a> (<a href="/wiki/Sara_Gilbert" title="Sara Gilbert">Sara Gilbert</a>), he is even more depressed. As Leonard slips deeper into his depression (which involves thinking about buying a cat and listening to emo music), Sheldon (in an attempt to not have a cat) points out that he was not actually rejected, as he had not asked Penny out. Leonard agrees and promptly asks Penny out to dinner, but she mistakes his invite as an invitation to hang with all the guys. Despite being aware of this, Leonard keeps the date and makes up excuses as to why the guys were absent.</p>
<p>On the date, Penny mentions the man Leonard had seen was not her boyfriend, and that she has a habit of having weekend long flings to get over relationships. Excited, Leonard begins to become more confident but, after accidentally hurting himself, the date becomes a disaster and Penny takes him home. Leonard does not get the courage to reveal his true feelings to Penny, even though she had suspected what he was up to.</p>

However when he arrives in the lab, Leslie makes it clear she used him just to satisfy her sex drive, saying she's 'Good till New Year's'. Leonard later tells Penny, who walks away with a smile on her face; she seems to be quite happy to hear this news.</p>

Wolowitz, once again single, says 'So, <i>Halo</i> night?' and the group is restored.</p>

<p>Leslie eventually agrees to date Leonard, repeatedly assuming the dominant role before conceding that he should "assume the male role". Leonard convinces Sheldon to leave the apartment, to give his roommate and Leslie some privacy.

<p>Sheldon returns to their apartment and formally approves the relationship between Leonard and Leslie, graciously overlooking that she actually believes <a href="/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity" title="Loop quantum gravity">loop quantum gravity</a> instead of <a href="/wiki/String_theory" title="String theory">string theory</a>.

Leslie expects Leonard to back up her beliefs but finds that he shares Sheldon's instead. Leslie then asks how they should raise the children as if it were a decision to raise their children in one religion or another. After learning about this "deal breaker" which she believes is more serious than Leonard's food allergy and shortness, she breaks up with Leonard. After which Sheldon tells Leonard to look on the bright side Leonard then replies with "What's the bright side?" Sheldon states that it is only 9 more months to <a href="/wiki/Comic-Con" title="Comic-Con">Comic-Con</a> and the episode ends.

<p>A phone call from Leonard's mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter (<a href="/wiki/Christine_Baranski" title="Christine Baranski">Christine Baranski</a>), leads to problems all around as childhood problems emerge from both Penny and Leonard. Penny bumps into Leonard's mom while doing laundry, and she reveals she is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist. Penny asks about Leonard's childhood, and his mother replies that he was 'in the phallic stage of psychosexual development, grabbing his penis and not letting go'. Penny tells Leonard's mother that she is an actress. By the time they reach Leonard's apartment, Penny is in tears after being psychoanalysed. Sheldon, on the other hand, instantly develops a comfortable relationship with the elder Dr. Hofstadter, resulting in the two discussing 'intimate' relationship points only to lead to a game of Rock Band. In the cafeteria at work, Howard thoroughly enjoys asking Leonard's mom about her other two, more successful children. Leonard gets his revenge by telling her that Howard lives with his mom and about Raj's selective mutism. She decides they are in an ersatz homosexual relationship. Later, Leonard and Penny seek comfort and discuss Leonard's mother first over white wine, then tequila. As the night progresses, Leonard tells Penny that he built a hugging machine when he was ten so he could get physical affection (his dad used to borrow it). Penny increases the stakes, resulting in a kiss. They eventually go to bed together, where Leonard tells her what his mother's reasoning for their impending sex would be: psychologically, he is having sex with his mom and she with her dad. Penny immediately throws Leonard out.</p>
The title refers to the visit made by Leonard's mother.&#160;</td>

<p>A paintball game leads to a fight between Penny and Sheldon, and romance for Wolowitz and Leslie (<a href="/wiki/Sara_Gilbert" title="Sara Gilbert">Sara Gilbert</a>). Penny accidently shoots the paintball gun at Sheldon's couch cushion (his "spot", his "only point of consistency in an ever-changing world"), and she and Leonard have a hard time getting it cleaned. They try just turning it over but Sheldon still notices the difference and turns it over to find the green stain. Penny has the cushion dry-cleaned, but it takes a week and Sheldon goes through withdrawal during that time. After refusing to sit on the dry-cleaned cushion, Leonard reveals that the Szechuan Palace (the only place Sheldon has his cashew chicken from) closed 2 years ago. Sheldon collapses into the couch but still doesn't like it. Sheldon gets his revenge by shooting Penny at the beginning of the group's next paintball game. Penny then shoots Sheldon, he protests she's dead. Leonard agrees and shoots Sheldon himself, who promptly fires back. The others leave. Meanwhile, Leslie and Howard start sleeping together at Howard's home, which lead to funny exchanges with Mrs. Wolowitz. Leslie is able to give Howard's work project some much-needed funds, although it turns out to be her way of controlling him. She asks him to come to her sister's wedding, he says no and she threatens to take away a trip to the CERN <a href="/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" title="Large Hadron Collider">Large Hadron Collider</a> project in Geneva. After getting over his initial reluctance to be in that sort of relationship, Howard accepts his "sex toy/arm candy" role.</p>

<p>A train trip to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> takes a major detour when Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz, and Raj discover that their favorite sci-fi actress in all the land (<a href="/wiki/Summer_Glau" title="Summer Glau">Summer Glau</a>) is on board. But the fanboy frenzy quickly gives way to a heated mass debate when they realize one of them will have to approach her. They took the train because the vote was 3 to 1 for flying, with Sheldon the one vote for the train. While Wolowitz tries to think of a clever opening line for Summer, Raj starts talking to her after drinking what he later discovered was non-alcoholic beer. When he discovers this, of course, he quits talking. Wolowitz then takes over and creeps Summer out. Leonard eventually gets his chance, but Summer gets off the train before he can introduce himself.</p>
<p>In a subplot, Sheldon needs Penny to find his flash drive so she can email him a paper he wants to show Professor <a href="/wiki/George_Smoot" title="George Smoot">George Smoot</a> (as himself) in San Francisco. Leonard asks Sheldon why he can't just e-mail the paper when he returns, and Sheldon replies that he "wants to see [Smoot's] face light up when he reads it." Sheldon initally responds with hostility to Leonard's suggestion that Penny should retrieve the flash drive, reminding Leonard that "no one goes into my room". Sheldon relents, however, and spends most of the episode giving Penny meticulous instructions as to how to enter his room (of course, stipulating that he is granting her access for this one time only). The instructions lead to a Japanese <a href="/wiki/Puzzle_box" title="Puzzle box">puzzle box</a> containing the flash drive. Sheldon attempts to give Penny instructions as how to open the box, but she instead throws it on the floor and smashes it open. After all of this effort, Smoot wasn't impressed with Sheldon's paper, asking him "Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?"</p>
<p>The title refers to the guest appearance of two stars: Summer Glau of <a href="/wiki/Terminator:_The_Sarah_Connor_Chronicles" title="Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a> and George Smoot who is famous for the discovery of observational traces of <a href="/wiki/Decoupling#Physical_cosmology" title="Decoupling">decoupling</a> in physical cosmology.</p>

<p>Penny's home hair-accessories business becomes a complete nightmare when a caffeine-addled Sheldon takes over. Sheldon offers his advice of how Penny can make more money, and then Leonard, Howard, and Raj add their own ideas to mass-produce and sell the products, which are hair barrettes called Pennyblossoms. Leonard makes a website to market and sell the products, and puts in a one-day rush shipping option because "Amazon has one-day rush." Right away, they get an order for 1000 Pennyblossoms from the "East Rutherford, New Jersey Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender Alliance." All 5 work all night to finish, only to see the same group had ordered 1000 more, leading everyone to quit because they are tired. All except Sheldon, that is, who is now wide awake and hyper because he was given coffee by Penny. At the end of the episode, Sheldon in his <a href="/wiki/The_Flash" title="The Flash" class="mw-redirect">The Flash</a> costume runs out to get more coffee.</p>

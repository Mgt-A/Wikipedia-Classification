Kibbutzim began as <a href="/wiki/Utopian" title="Utopian" class="mw-redirect">utopian</a> communities, but have gradually embraced a more "scientific" socialist approach.

<p>Conditions were hard for all subjects of the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russia" title="Imperial Russia" class="mw-redirect">Russian Empire</a> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but they were especially difficult for <a href="/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jews</a>. It was the underlying policy of the Russian government in its 1882 <a href="/wiki/May_Laws" title="May Laws">May Laws</a> to "cause one-third of the Jews to emigrate, one-third to accept baptism, and one-third to starve."<sup id="cite_ref-er1_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-er1-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Except for a wealthy few, Jews could not leave the <a href="/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement" title="Pale of Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a>; within it, some Jews could neither live in large cities, such as <a href="/wiki/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, nor any village with fewer than 500 residents, even if a person needed rural medical recuperation.</p>
<p>The Tsarist government disproportionately conscripted Jews into the <a href="/wiki/Russian_army" title="Russian army" class="mw-redirect">Russian army</a>. Jewish soldiers suffered severe discrimination; they had to leave the Pale of Settlement to serve with their units, but when their units were given <a href="/wiki/Furlough" title="Furlough">furlough</a>, Jews had to return to the <a href="/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement" title="Pale of Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a>, even if their service was in the Russian Far East. There were other laws in effect which allowed the expulsion of Jewish families that had no breadwinner. During the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, many magistrates in <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> took advantage of the fact that Jewish men were away at the front to expel their families.</p>
<p>Beginning in the aftermath of the assassination of <a href="/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Russia" title="Alexander II of Russia">Alexander II</a> in 1881, the Russian <a href="/wiki/Autocracy" title="Autocracy">autocracy</a> allowed and encouraged its discontented peasants to take out their frustrations on their Jewish neighbors. In May 1882, Tsar <a href="/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Russia" title="Alexander III of Russia">Alexander III</a> issued the so-called "<a href="/wiki/May_Laws" title="May Laws">May Laws</a>." The May Laws forbade Jews to live in towns with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants and systematized the anti-Jewish quotas that kept thousands of Jews out of the professions and out of university. The consequence of the residency laws was that hundreds of thousands of Jews were expelled from towns and villages that their families had resided in for generations. The turn of the century marked a high point for Jewish oppression in Russia.</p>
<p>Jews responded to the pressures on them in different ways. Some saw their future in a reformed Russia and joined Socialist political parties. Other Jews saw the future of Jews in Russia as being <i>out</i> of Russia, and thus emigrated to the West. Other Jews took little notice of the changing world and continued in orthodoxy. Still other Jews took the opposite course and became assimilationists. Last but not least among the ideological choices that presented themselves to Jews in late 19th century Russia was <a href="/wiki/Zionism" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, the movement for the creation of a Jewish homeland in the cradle of Judaism, <a href="/wiki/Palestine" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>, or, as Jews called it, <a href="/wiki/Eretz_Yisrael" title="Eretz Yisrael" class="mw-redirect">Eretz Yisrael</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to this time of increased persecution, Jews had gone to Palestine either late in life to die or as young people to attend the various <a href="/wiki/Yeshiva" title="Yeshiva">yeshivas</a> clustered in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hebron" title="Hebron">Hebron</a>. These individuals were religious and had no political ambitions. In fact, instead of having livelihoods, they relied on charitable contributions of Jews from abroad.</p>
<p>Although Zionism's antecedents can be traced back into distant <a href="/wiki/Jewish_history" title="Jewish history">Jewish history</a>, the ideology emerged as a significant force in Jewish life only in the 1880s. In that decade approximately 15,000 Jews, mostly from southern Russia, moved to Palestine with the two intentions of <i>living</i> there, as opposed to dying and being buried there, and of farming there, as opposed to studying. This movement of Jews to Palestine in the 1880s is called the "<a href="/wiki/Immigration_to_Palestine_and_Israel#First_Aliyah_.281882-1903.29" title="Immigration to Palestine and Israel" class="mw-redirect">First Aliyah</a>".</p>
<p>Zionism is usually understood to mean a kind of <a href="/wiki/Nationalism" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a>, but Zionism also had economic and cultural aspects. Zionism's chief economic program was for Jews to abandon inn-keeping, pawn-brokering, and petty selling in favor of a return to the land and its cultivation.</p>

The first aliyah: Biluim agricultural settlements in the 1880s were the forerunners of the kibbutz movement</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Jews of the First Aliya generation believed that <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Diaspora" title="Jewish Diaspora" class="mw-redirect">Diaspora</a> Jews had sunk low due to their typical disdain for physical labor. Their ideology was that the Jewish people could be "redeemed"—physically as well as spiritually—by toiling in the fields of Palestine. It was believed that the soil of Palestine had magical properties to metamorphose feeble Jewish merchants into strong, noble farmers. In 1883 the London (UK) newspaper <i>The Jewish Chronicle</i> wrote of the new Jewish agriculturalist in Palestine that he had been transformed from "the pallid, stooping Jewish pedlar and tradesman of a few months back … into the bronzed, horny-handed, manly tiller of the soil."<sup id="cite_ref-SB_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SB-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In harmony with the "religion of labor," the <a href="/wiki/Bilu" title="Bilu">Biluim</a> manifesto proudly called for the "encouragement and strengthening of immigration and colonization in Eretz Yisrael through the establishment of an agricultural colony, built on cooperative social foundations." In harmony with the yet unnamed ideology of Zionism the Biluim called for the "polico-economic and national spiritual revival of the Jewish people in Palestine."</p>
<p>The Biluim came to Eretz Yisrael with high hopes of success as a peasant class, but their enthusiasm was perhaps greater than their agricultural ability. Within a year of living in Palestine the Biluim had become dependent on charity, just as their scholarly brethren in Jerusalem were. The difference between the charity that sustained the Biluim and the charity that sustained the scholars was that the Biluim used donations for land and agricultural equipment purchases.</p>
<p>Thanks to donations of regular Jews who read the above quotation from the <i>Jewish Chronicle</i> and extremely wealthy Jews such as Baron <a href="/wiki/Edmond_James_de_Rothschild" title="Edmond James de Rothschild">Edmond James de Rothschild</a>, the Biluim were able to eventually prosper. Their towns, <a href="/wiki/Rishon_LeZion" title="Rishon LeZion">Rishon LeZion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rehovot" title="Rehovot">Rehovot</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gedera" title="Gedera">Gedera</a> developed into dynamic communities while their culture of labor evolved: instead of cultivating the soil on their own land, the Biluim hired Arabs to work the land in their place. The much-heralded economic revolution had yet to occur.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Pogrom" title="Pogrom">Pogroms</a> flared up once again in Russia in the first years of the 20th century. In 1903 at <a href="/wiki/Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u" title="Chişinău">Kishinev</a> peasant mobs were incited against Jews after a <a href="/wiki/Blood_libel" title="Blood libel">blood libel</a>. Riots again took place in the wake of Russia's defeat in the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1905" title="Russian Revolution of 1905" class="mw-redirect">1905 Revolution</a>. The occurrence of new pogroms inspired yet another wave of Russian Jews to emigrate. As in the 1880s, most emigrants went to the United States, but a minority went to Palestine. It was this generation that would include founders of the kibbutzim.</p>
<p>Like the members of the First Aliya who came before them, most members of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Aliya" title="Second Aliya" class="mw-redirect">Second Aliya</a> wanted to be farmers in the Trans-Jordan. Those who would go on to found the kibbutzim first went to a village of the Biluim, <a href="/wiki/Rishon_LeZion" title="Rishon LeZion">Rishon LeZion</a>, to find work there. The founders of the kibbutz were morally appalled by what they saw in the Jewish settlers there "with their Jewish overseers, Arab peasant laborers, and Bedouin guards." They saw the new villages and were reminded of the places they had left in Eastern Europe. Instead of the beginning of a pure Jewish commonwealth, they felt that what they saw recreated the Jewish socioeconomic structure of the Pale of Settlement, where Jews functioned in clean jobs, while other groups did the dirty work.<sup id="cite_ref-Gavron19_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gavron19-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/w/index.php?title=Yossef_Baratz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yossef Baratz (page does not exist)">Yossef Baratz</a>, who went on to found the first kibbutz, wrote of his time working at Zikhron Yaakov:</p>
<dl>
<dd>We were happy enough working on the land, but we knew more and more certainly that the ways of the old settlements were not for us. This was not the way we hoped to settle the country—this old way with Jews on top and Arabs working for them; anyway, we thought that there shouldn't be employers and employed at all. There must be a better way.<sup id="cite_ref-Baratz52_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Baratz52-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Though Baratz and other laborers wanted to farm the land themselves, becoming independent farmers was not a realistic option in 1909. As <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Ruppin" title="Arthur Ruppin">Arthur Ruppin</a>, a proponent of Jewish agricultural colonization of the Trans-Jordan would later say, "The question was not whether group settlement was preferable to individual settlement; it was rather one of either group settlement or no settlement at all."<sup id="cite_ref-Rayman12_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rayman12-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> Palestine was a harsh environment, quite unlike the Russian plains the Jewish immigrants were familiar with. The Galilee was swampy, the <a href="/wiki/Judean_Hills" title="Judean Hills" class="mw-redirect">Judean Hills</a> rocky, and the South of the country, the <a href="/wiki/Negev" title="Negev">Negev</a>, was a desert. To make things more challenging, most of the settlers had no prior farming experience. The sanitary conditions were also poor. <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">Malaria</a> was more than a risk, it was nearly a guarantee. Along with malaria, there were <a href="/wiki/Typhus" title="Typhus">typhus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to having a difficult climate and relatively infertile soils, Ottoman Palestine was in some ways a lawless place. <a href="/wiki/Nomad" title="Nomad">Nomadic</a> <a href="/wiki/Bedouins" title="Bedouins" class="mw-redirect">Bedouins</a> would frequently raid farms and settled areas. Sabotage of irrigation canals and burning of crops were also common. Living collectively was simply the most logical way to be secure in an unwelcoming land.</p>
<p>On top of considerations of safety, there were also those of <a href="/wiki/Economics" title="Economics">economic</a> survival. Establishing a new farm in the area was a capital-intensive project; collectively the founders of the kibbutzim had the resources to establish something lasting, while independently they did not.</p>
<p>Finally, the land that was going to be settled by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Yossef_Baratz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Yossef Baratz (page does not exist)">Yossef Baratz</a> and his comrades had been purchased by the greater <a href="/wiki/Jewish_community" title="Jewish community" class="mw-redirect">Jewish community</a>. From around the world, Jews dropped coins into <a href="/wiki/JNF" title="JNF" class="mw-redirect">JNF</a> "Blue Boxes" for land purchases in Palestine. Since these efforts were on behalf of all Jews in the area, it would not have made sense for their land purchases to be conveyed to individuals.</p>
<p>In 1909, Baratz, nine other men, and two women established themselves at the southern end of the <a href="/wiki/Sea_of_Galilee" title="Sea of Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> near an Arab village called "Umm Juni." These teenagers had hitherto worked as day laborers draining swamps, as masons, or as hands at the older Jewish settlements. Their dream was now to work for themselves, building up the land. They called their community "<a href="/wiki/Kvutza" title="Kvutza">Kvutzat</a> <a href="/wiki/Degania" title="Degania">Degania</a>", after the cereals which they grew there. Their community would grow into the first kibbutz.</p>
<p>The founders of <a href="/wiki/Degania" title="Degania">Degania</a> worked backbreaking labor attempting to rebuild what they saw as their ancestral land and to spread the social revolution. One pioneer later said "the body is crushed, the legs fail, the head hurts, the sun burns and weakens." At times half of the kibbutz members could not report for work. Many young men and women left the kibbutz for easier lives in Jewish Trans-Jordan cities or in the Diaspora.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties, by 1914, Degania had fifty members. Other kibbutzim were founded around the Sea of Galilee and the nearby <a href="/wiki/Jezreel_Valley" title="Jezreel Valley">Jezreel Valley</a>. The founders of Degania themselves soon left Degania to become apostles of agriculture and socialism for newer kibbutzim.</p>

<p>The fall of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I, followed by the arrival of the British, brought with it benefits for the Jewish community of Palestine and its kibbutzim. The Ottoman authorities had made immigration to Palestine difficult and restricted land purchases. Rising anti-semitism forced many Jews to flee Eastern Europe. To escape the pogroms, tens of thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to Palestine in the early 1920s, in a wave of immigration that was called the "Third Aliya."</p>
<p>After the <a href="/wiki/Bolshevik" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> consolidation of power, Jews of Russia and Ukraine could not emigrate. In the rest of the 1920s Jewish immigrants to Palestine would come from the rest of Eastern and Central Europe, the "Fourth Aliya." These Third and Fourth Aliya immigrants would actually do more for the growth of the kibbutz movement than the immigrants of previous immigration groups.</p>
<p>Partly based on German youth movements and the <a href="/wiki/Scouting" title="Scouting">Boy Scouts</a>, Zionist Jewish youth movements flourished in the 1920s in virtually every European nation. Youth movements came in every shade of the political spectrum. There were rightist movements like <a href="/wiki/Betar_(youth_movement)" title="Betar (youth movement)" class="mw-redirect">Betar</a> and religious movements like <a href="/wiki/Chabad" title="Chabad">Chabad</a>, but most of these Zionist youth movements were socialist such as Dror, Brit Haolim, Kadima, Habonim (now <a href="/wiki/Habonim_Dror" title="Habonim Dror">Habonim Dror</a>), and Wekleute. Of the leftist youth movements the most significant in kibbutz history was to be the Marxist <a href="/wiki/Hashomer_Hatzair" title="Hashomer Hatzair">Hashomer Hatzair</a>. In the 1920s the left-oriented youth movements would become feeders for the kibbutzim.</p>
<p>In contrast to those who came as part of the Second Aliya, these youth group members had some agricultural training before embarking. Members of the Second Aliya and Third Aliyas were also less likely to be Russian, since emigration from Russia was closed off after the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" title="Russian Revolution of 1917" class="mw-redirect">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>. European Jews who settled on kibbutzim between the World Wars were from other countries in Eastern Europe, including <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Finally, the members of the Third Aliya were to the left of the founders of Degania, and believed that voluntary socialism could work for everyone. They considered themselves to be a vanguard movement that would inspire the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Degania in the 1910s seems to have confined its discussions to practical matters, but the conversations of the next generation in the 1920s and 1930s were free-flowing discussions of the cosmos. Instead of having a meeting in a dining room, meetings were held around campfires. Instead of beginning a meeting with a reading of minutes, a meeting would begin with a group dance. Remembering her youth on a kibbutz by the Sea of Galilee, a woman remembered "Oh, how beautiful it was when we all took part in the discussions, [they were] nights of searching for one another—that is what I call those hallowed nights. During the moments of silence, it seemed to me that from each heart a spark would burst forth, and the sparks would unite in one great flame penetrating the heavens…. At the center of our camp a fire burns, and under the weight of the <a href="/wiki/Hora" title="Hora">hora</a> the earth groans a rhythmic groan, accompanied by wild songs."<sup id="cite_ref-Gavron45_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gavron45-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Kibbutzim founded in the 1920s tended to be larger than the kibbutzim like Degania which were founded prior to World War I. Degania had had twelve members at its founding. Ein Harod, founded only a decade later, began with 215 members.</p>
<p>Altogether kibbutzim grew and flourished in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1922 there were scarcely 700 individuals living on kibbutzim in Palestine. By 1927 the kibbutz population was approaching 2,000. By the eve of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> the kibbutz population was 25,000, 5% of the total population of the yishuv, while in 1950 they grew up to 65,000, 7.5% of the population. However, because of major crises in the two largest kibbutz movements that became leftists in the late 1940s (see below), there was mass attrition and growth almost stopped until the 1960s when it renewed up to the 1989 when population reached the peak of 129,000.</p>
<p>The kibbutzim grew up as three main movements organized as federations in 1927-1929 with different ideologies and practices, but the differences between kibbutzim were always smaller than their similarities. In 1927 was established the mainstream movement known as "United Kibbutz", or "'<i>Kibbutz Hameuhad</i>" that consisted some half of the kibbutzim. Some new kibbutzim that had been founded by youth of <a href="/wiki/HaShomer_Hatzair" title="HaShomer Hatzair" class="mw-redirect">HaShomer Hatzair</a> who banded together to form another countrywide association, <a href="/wiki/Kibbutz_Artzi" title="Kibbutz Artzi" class="mw-redirect">Kibbutz Artzi</a> which consisted some 30% of kibbutzim. In 1936, the Kibbutz Artzi Federation founded its own political party called the <i>Socialist League of Palestine</i> but generally known as <i>Hashomer Hatzair</i>. It merged with Hakibbutz Hameuchad left-wing party to become <a href="/wiki/Mapam" title="Mapam">Mapam</a> once the state of Israel was established. Mapam was a leftist party that revered the Soviet Union, a policy adopted by main leaders Tabenkin of Kibbutz Meuchad and Yaari of Kibbutz Artzi in order to preserve their rule <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1928 Kibbutz Degania and other small kibbutzim formed together a group called "Chever Hakvutzot", the "Association of Kvutzot." Kvutzot kibbutzim deliberately stayed under 200 in population. They believed that for collective life to work, groups had to be small and intimate, or else the trust between members would be lost. Kvutzot kibbutzim also lacked youth-group affiliations in Europe.</p>
<p>The Kibbutz Meuhad accused Artzi and the kvutzot of elitism. Hameuhad criticized Artzi for thinking of itself as a socialist elite, and they criticized the kvutzot for staying too selective and small. Hameuhad kibbutzim took in as many members as they could. Givat Brenner eventually came to have more than 1,500 members.</p>
<p>Artzi kibbutzim were also more devoted to <a href="/wiki/Equality_of_the_sexes" title="Equality of the sexes" class="mw-redirect">equality of the sexes</a> than other kibbutzim. A 1920s, 1930s era kibbutz woman would call her husband <i>ishi</i>—"My man"—rather than the usual Hebrew word, <i>ba'ali</i>, which literally means "My owner."</p>
<p>There were also differences in religion. Kibbutz Artzi and Kibbutz Meuchad kibbutzim were <a href="/wiki/Secular" title="Secular" class="mw-redirect">secular</a>, even staunchly <a href="/wiki/Atheist" title="Atheist" class="mw-redirect">atheistic</a>, proudly trying to be "monasteries without God." Most mainstream kibbutzim also disdained the <a href="/wiki/Orthodox_Judaism" title="Orthodox Judaism">Orthodox Judaism</a> of their parents, but they wanted their new communities to have Jewish characteristics nonetheless. Friday nights were still "<a href="/wiki/Shabbat" title="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>" with a white tablecloth and fine food, and work was not done on Saturday if it could be avoided. Only late some kibbutzim adopted <a href="/wiki/Yom_Kippur" title="Yom Kippur">Yom Kippur</a> as the day to discuss fears for the future of the kibbutz. Kibbutzim also had collective <a href="/wiki/Bar_mitzvah" title="Bar mitzvah" class="mw-redirect">bar mitzvahs</a> for their children.</p>
<p>If kibbutzniks did not pray several times a day, kibbutzniks marked holidays like <a href="/wiki/Shavuot" title="Shavuot">Shavuot</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sukkot" title="Sukkot">Sukkot</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Passover" title="Passover">Passover</a> with dances, meals, and celebrations. One Jewish holiday, <a href="/wiki/Tu_B%27shvat" title="Tu B'shvat" class="mw-redirect">Tu B'shvat</a>, the "birthday of the trees" was substantially revived by kibbutzim. All in all, holidays with some kind of natural component, like Passover and Sukkoth, were the most significant for kibbutzim.</p>
<p>The kibbutz movement developed an overtly religious faction late in its history, a group now called the <a href="/wiki/Religious_Kibbutz_Movement" title="Religious Kibbutz Movement">Religious Kibbutz Movement</a>. The first religious kibbutz was Ein Tzurim, founded in 1946. Ein Tzurim was first located by <a href="/wiki/Safad" title="Safad" class="mw-redirect">Safad</a>, then by <a href="/wiki/Hebron" title="Hebron">Hebron</a> in what is now the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, then finally in the <a href="/wiki/Negev" title="Negev">Negev</a>. Religious kibbutzim are obviously religious, but they were and are no less collectivist than secular kibbutzim. Some religious kibbutzim now identify with the "hippie <a href="/wiki/Hasidism" title="Hasidism" class="mw-redirect">Hasidism</a>" of rabbis like <a href="/wiki/Shlomo_Carlebach" title="Shlomo Carlebach" class="mw-redirect">Shlomo Carlebach</a>.</p>

<p>In Ottoman times kibbutzim worried about criminal violence, not political violence. The lack of Arab hostility was due to the small number of Jews in the country at the time. Arab opposition increased as the <a href="/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917" title="Balfour Declaration of 1917">Balfour Declaration</a> and the wave of Jewish aliyas to Palestine began to tilt the demographic balance of the area. There were bloody anti-Jewish riots in Jerusalem in 1921 and in Hebron in 1929. In the late 1930s Arab-Jewish violence became virtually constant, a time called the "<a href="/wiki/Great_Uprising" title="Great Uprising" class="mw-redirect">Great Uprising</a>" in Palestinian historiography.</p>
<p>During the Great Uprising kibbutzim began to assume a more prominent military role than they had previously. Rifles were purchased or manufactured and kibbutz members drilled and practiced shooting. <a href="/wiki/Yigal_Allon" title="Yigal Allon">Yigal Allon</a>, an Israeli soldier and statesman, explained the role of kibbutzim in the military activities of the yishuv.</p>

<dd>The planning and development of pioneering Zionist were from the start at least partly determined by politico-strategic needs. The choice of the location of the settlements, for instance, was influenced not only by considerations of economic viability but also and even chiefly by the needs of local defense, overall settlement strategy, and by the role such blocks of settlements might play in some future, perhaps decisive all out struggle. Accordingly, land was purchased, or more often reclaimed, in remote parts of the country.<sup id="cite_ref-Rayman_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rayman-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>Kibbutzim also played a role in defining the borders of the Jewish state-to-be. By the late 1930s when it appeared that Palestine would be <a href="/wiki/Partition_(politics)" title="Partition (politics)">partitioned</a> between Arabs and Jews, kibbutzim were planted in remote parts of the Mandate to make it more likely that the land would be incorporated into the Jewish state (which was called eventually Israel), not a Palestinian Arab state. Many of these kibbutzim were founded, literally, in the middle of the night. In 1946, on the day after <a href="/wiki/Yom_Kippur" title="Yom Kippur">Yom Kippur</a>, <a href="/wiki/11_points_in_the_Negev" title="11 points in the Negev">eleven new "Tower and Stockade" kibbutzim</a> were hurriedly established in the northern part of the Negev to give Israel a better claim to this arid, but strategically important, region.</p>
<p>Not all kibbutzniks worked to expand the amount of territory that would be given to the Jewish state. The leftwing, <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> faction of the kibbutz movement, Kibbutz Artzi, was the last major element in the yishuv to favor a <a href="/wiki/Binationalism" title="Binationalism" class="mw-redirect">binational state</a>, rather than partition. Kibbutz Artzi, however, still wanted free Jewish immigration, which the Arabs opposed.</p>
<p>Kibbutzniks were considered to have fought very bravely in the <a href="/wiki/1948_Arab-Israeli_War" title="1948 Arab-Israeli War" class="mw-redirect">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>, emerging from the conflict with enhanced prestige in the nascent State of Israel. Members of Kibbutz Degania were instrumental in stopping the <a href="/wiki/Syria" title="Syria">Syrian</a> tank advance into the Galilee with homemade <a href="/wiki/Gasoline_bomb" title="Gasoline bomb" class="mw-redirect">gasoline bombs</a>. Another kibbutz, Maagan Michael, manufactured the bullets for the <a href="/wiki/Sten_gun" title="Sten gun" class="mw-redirect">Sten guns</a> that won the war. Maagan Michael's clandestine <a href="/wiki/Ammunition" title="Ammunition">ammunition</a> factory was later separated from the kibbutz and grew into TAAS (<a href="/wiki/Israel_Military_Industries" title="Israel Military Industries">Israel Military Industries</a>).</p>

<p>The establishment of Israel and flood of Jewish refugees from Europe and the Muslim world presented challenges and opportunities for kibbutzim. The immigrant tide offered kibbutzim a chance to expand through new members and inexpensive labor, but it also meant that <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi" title="Ashkenazi" class="mw-redirect">Ashkenazi</a> kibbutzim would have to adapt to Jews whose background was far different from their own.</p>
<p>The first challenge that kibbutzim faced was the question of how to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of Middle Eastern Jews, or <a href="/wiki/Mizrahi" title="Mizrahi" class="mw-redirect">mizrahi</a>. Until the 1950s, nearly all kibbutzniks were from Eastern Europe, culturally different from their cousins from places like <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tunisia" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Iraq" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. Many kibbutzim found themselves hiring <a href="/wiki/Mizrahim" title="Mizrahim" class="mw-redirect">Mizrahim</a> to work their fields and expand infrastructure, but not actually admitting very many as members. Since few mizrahi would ever join kibbutzim, the percentage of Israelis living on kibbutzim peaked around the time of statehood.</p>
<p>Another dispute occurred solely over ideology. Israel had been initially recognized by both the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">USA</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. For the first three years of its existence, Israel was in the <a href="/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement" title="Non-Aligned Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a>, but <a href="/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion" title="David Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a> gradually began to take sides with the <a href="/wiki/Western_world" title="Western world">West</a>. The question of which side of the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> Israel should choose created fissures in the kibbutz movement. Dining halls segregated according to politics and a few kibbutzim even saw <a href="/wiki/Marxist" title="Marxist" class="mw-redirect">Marxist</a> members leave. This controversy cooled once Stalin's cruelty became better known and once it became clear that the Soviet Union was systematically anti-Semitic. The disillusionment particularly set in after the <a href="/wiki/Prague_Trials" title="Prague Trials" class="mw-redirect">Prague Trials</a> in which an envoy of Hashomer Hatzair in Prague was tried in an <a href="/wiki/Anti-Semitic" title="Anti-Semitic" class="mw-redirect">anti-Semitic</a> <a href="/wiki/Show_trial" title="Show trial">show trial</a>.</p>
<p>Yet another controversy in the kibbutz movement was the question over <a href="/wiki/Holocaust_reparations" title="Holocaust reparations" class="mw-redirect">Holocaust reparations</a> from <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a>. Should kibbutz members turn over income that was the product of a very personal loss? If Holocaust survivors were allowed to keep their reparation money, what would that mean for the principle of equality? Eventually, many kibbutzim made this one concession to inequality by letting Holocaust survivors keep all or a percentage of their reparations. Reparations that were turned over to the collective were used for building expansion and even recreational activities.</p>
<p>Kibbutzniks enjoyed a steady and gradual improvement in their standard of living in the first few decades after independence. In the 1960s, kibbutzim actually saw their standard of living improve faster than Israel's general population. Most kibbutz swimming pools date from the good decade of the 1960s.</p>
<p>Kibbutzim also continued to play an outsize role in Israel's defense apparatus. In the 1950s and 1960s many kibbutzim were in fact founded by an <a href="/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces" title="Israel Defense Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a> group called <a href="/wiki/Nahal" title="Nahal">Nahal</a>. Many of these 1950s and 1960s Nahal kibbutzim were founded on the precarious and porous borders of the state. In the <a href="/wiki/Six-Day_War" title="Six-Day War">Six-Day War</a>, when Israel lost 800 soldiers, 200 of them were from kibbutzim. The prestige that kibbutzniks enjoyed in Israel in the 1960s was reflected in the <a href="/wiki/Knesset" title="Knesset">Knesset</a>. When only 4% of Israelis were kibbutzniks, kibbutzniks made up 15% of Israel's parliament.<sup id="cite_ref-Bettelheim15_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bettelheim15-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As late as the 1970s, kibbutzim seemed to be thriving in every way. Kibbutzniks performed working class, or even peasant class, occupations, yet enjoyed a middle class lifestyle.</p>

<p>With a changing of the generations in the kibbutzim societies, several wide changes occurred in the structure and culture of the kibbutzim. In general, the process could be described in which a significantly weakening happened to the different communal characteristic.</p>
<p>With time, the kibbutz members’ sense of identification with the kibbutz and its goals significantly decreased. This process originated both from personal frustrations among the kibbutz members which development as a result of internal processes which happened in the kibbutz, and from the growing stratification and inequality of kibbutz society because of the capitalistic cultures of inter-kibbutz organizations headed by kibbutz elite members and capitalistic cultures adopted by many kibbutz factory managers who followed the lead of the former elite.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> In addition, over the years some of the kibbutz members made professional careers outside the kibbutz and followed the norms of capitalist society and much like the two former elites also accumulated power, privileges, prestige and other capitals by which some of them or the former elites ruled over the kibbutzim and made their democracy largely ineffective <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> As part of this process, remoteness was created between the individual and basic values of the kibbutz. This weakening resulted in the breach of the balance which existed between the individual values and the values of the kibbutz. This gap was reflected also in with motivation problems at work.</p>
<p>The work motivational methods of the Kibbutzim changed, and an emphasis was placed on the creation of various social compensations to urge the workers to continue their work, instead of accepting the concept of canceling work. These processes occurred in parallel with several severe economic crises, which included, among other things, a decrease in the incomes and a severe banking crisis which later was named “the kibbutzim crises”.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the weakening of the linkage between the kibbutz members' to the kibbutz:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Privatization_in_Israel" title="Privatization in Israel">privatization</a> processes and the adoption of non-cooperative beliefs in all of the Israeli society, affected the moral and structural support of kibbutzim, and with the years penetrated the new generations of the kibbutzim.</li>
<li>The kibbutzim were built on the attempt to create a permanent and institutionalized framework, which would be able to set a pattern of conduct which would successfully handle the implementation of shared values. The attempt to place such a regular pattern required creativity in the adoption of kibbutz practices to its growth and changing kibbutz system and encompassing society, but kibbutz leadership suppressed innovators and critical thinkers, causing either failures to deal with changes or adoption of capitalist solutions that negated kibbutz basic principles.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>The kibbutzim had a <a href="/wiki/Rural" title="Rural">rural</a> patterns of settlements, while over the years the Israeli society began adopting <a href="/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban</a> patterns of settlements. The lack of match between the patterns of the kibbutz society and the majority of the Israeli society, appealed the strong linkage between the kibbutzim with the entire Israeli society, a principle which didn’t allow the continuation of the collaborative model (because of the internal weakening and the loss of the all-Israeli legitimacy).</li>
<li>The kibbutzim were established during the pioneer period and were the fulfillment of the Zionist vision, during that period of time every member was required to give the maximum from himself for the good of the collective: the kibbutz and the state. In addition, as a group it was easier to deal with the common problems of the individuals – which allowed the recruitment of a large number of people for maintaining the safety of the community at that time, and therefore this way of life was suited for the Zionist goals more than other forms of life at that time.</li>
<li>The original concept of the kibbutzim was based to a large extent on self-sacrifice of its members for the sake of abstract foundations and not on the cancellation of work, and therefore after the pioneer period the linkage between the kibbutz members decreased, due to the decline in the pioneering spirit and the decline in the importance of the self-sacrifice values.</li>
<li>When the kibbutz was perceived as an initiator for values national objectives, it was very much appreciated in the Israeli society and it was easier for the members to identify themselves with the kibbutz, its function and it’s significantly. With the decrease of its appreciation and the minimizing of the social significances in the Israeli society, the kibbutz identity weakened.</li>
<li>The kibbutzim weren't capable of dealing with the increase in the standard of living in order to keep the communal values relevant, which eventually led to the changes in patterns of life of many members which harmed the relevancy of the communal framework which was not adapted to this.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Globalization" title="Globalization">globalization</a> processes and the kibbutz failure to block them exposed the kibbutz society to a different type of culture. For example, after kibbutz members were allowed to have Television sets in their own homes, the kibbutz members were exposed to “the good life” in which people were compensated for their work and could buy themselves different luxurious items. The kibbutzim weren't capable of dealing with these processes.</li>
<li>The fall of the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> resulted in the weakening of <a href="/wiki/Socialist" title="Socialist" class="mw-redirect">Socialist</a> beliefs around the world, including in the kibbutz society. This process was followed by the <a href="/wiki/Capitalist" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> system which became stronger and started spreading and the when the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> became the sole <a href="/wiki/Superpower" title="Superpower">superpower</a>, as well as a media exposure to the totalitarian characteristics of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s regime, and the violent large scaled <a href="/wiki/Despotism" title="Despotism">tyranny</a> and <a href="/wiki/Oppression" title="Oppression">oppression</a> manifestations which followed it.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Kibbutz&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: The change processes in the kibbutzim">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The change processes in the kibbutzim</span></h3>
<p>During the 1980s, following the peak of the kibbutzim crisis, many kibbutz members started leaving their kibbutzim and there were many social tensions created due to the economic distress in the kibbutzim, and due to these factors different significant changing processes began in some of the kibbutzim. Initially, there weren’t that many kibbutzim that had to deal with internal struggles regarding the changes and the change opposing movements. Since the mid 1990s the amount of kibbutzim which made significant changes in kibbutz lifestyle continued gradually to grow while the resistance to these changes gradually decreased.</p>
<p>The changes which occurred could be divided into three main types:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Extensive privatization of the kibbutz services</b> - in fact, such a privatization already exists nowadays a couple of decades in most of the kibbutzim, and through the years, many of the kibbutzim privatized different services every now and then. But, until lately the privatization was only made in matters which were considered relatively minor. Today the kibbutzim there are kibbutzim which have privatized (some of them with subsidies) also two of the services which were once considered untouchable – their <a href="/wiki/Education" title="Education">education</a> and <a href="/wiki/Health_care_systems" title="Health care systems">health</a> systems.</li>
<li><b>"Differential wage"</b> - Up until the change each kibbutz member got an equal budget according to his or her needs - after the change each member started getting a budget which is relative to the job they have.</li>
<li><b>"Association of properties"</b> - a term which relates to the transferring of some of the properties which belong nowadays to the kibbutz as a cooperative commonality, to the ownership of kibbutz members. This is actually true privatization (unlike the services privatization). One type of property is the apartments where the members live and the second type of property is a sort of a "stock" in the manufacturing part of the kibbutz. The intention is that the kibbutz members would be able to sell and to bequeath both of these types of properties within certain limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to state that each kibbutz has different changing processes. Every kibbutz has a model for change with many different versions for each of the components mentioned above. There are many people however, outside and inside the kibbutzim, which claim these changes bring an end to the kibbutz concept.</p>
<p>Amongst the communities which had recently ceased being kibbutzim (officially): Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley, HaGoshrim in the Upper Galilee, Beit Nir in the Negev, etc.</p>
<p>These processes have created the "renewing kibbutz" (הקיבוץ המתחדש ) – a kibbutz settlement pattern which isn’t fully based on the original values of the kibbutz. Kibbutzim whom try to keep the original kibbutz values are syndicated under a group called "The collaborative model" (הזרם השיתופי).</p>
<p><a name="Ideology_of_the_kibbutz_movement" id="Ideology_of_the_kibbutz_movement"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Kibbutz&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Ideology of the kibbutz movement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Ideology of the kibbutz movement</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/First_Aliyah" title="First Aliyah">First Aliyah</a> immigrants were largely religious, but those of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Aliyah" title="Second Aliyah">Second Aliyah</a> were mainly secular. A Jewish work ethic thus replaced religious practice. <a href="/wiki/Berl_Katznelson" title="Berl Katznelson">Berl Katznelson</a>, a Labor Zionist leader articulated this when he said "Everywhere the Jewish laborer goes, the divine presence goes with him."<sup id="cite_ref-Segev255_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Segev255-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to redeeming the Jewish nation through work, there was also an element of redeeming Eretz Yisrael - Palestine - in the kibbutz ideology. In the contemporary <a href="/wiki/Yiddish" title="Yiddish" class="mw-redirect">Yiddish</a> <a href="/wiki/Anti-Zionism" title="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionist</a> literature that was circulating around Eastern Europe, Palestine was mocked as <i>dos gepeigerte land</i>, "the country that had died." Kibbutz members found immense gratification in bringing the land back to life by planting trees, draining swamps, and countless other hard-graft activities to make the land (invariably wetlands) productive. In soliciting donations, kibbutzim and other Zionist settlement activities presented themselves as "making the desert bloom."</p>
<p>Most kibbutzim were founded upon disputed land. Like most other Jewish agricultural communities, kibbutzim were founded in three relatively small, flat, low-lying regions of the country, the upper <a href="/wiki/Jordan_Valley" title="Jordan Valley">Jordan Valley</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Jezreel_Valley" title="Jezreel Valley">Jezreel Valley</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Sharon" title="Sharon">Sharon</a> <a href="/wiki/Coastal_plain" title="Coastal plain">coastal plain</a>. The land was marshy and highly fertile, but available for purchase because it was infested with malaria and thus unproductive. Most early kibbutzniks, including <a href="/wiki/David_ben_Gurion" title="David ben Gurion" class="mw-redirect">David ben Gurion</a> himself, suffered from malaria. In areas of higher elevation without standing water, where mosquitos could not breed—such as the area now called the <a href="/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>—there were few if any kibbutzim.</p>
<p>Members of a kibbutz, or <i>kibbutzniks</i>, like other participants in the Zionist movement, had not considered the possibility of conflict between Jews and Arabs over Palestine. Mainstream Zionists predicted the Arab population would be grateful for the economic benefits that the Jews would bring. The left wing of the kibbutz movement believed that the enemies of the Arab peasants were Arab landowners (called <i><a href="/wiki/Effendi" title="Effendi">effendis</a></i>), not fellow Jewish farmers. By the late 1930s as the struggle against world fascism and for a political refuge for persecuted Jews began, kibbutzniks began to assume a military role in the <i>New <a href="/wiki/Yishuv" title="Yishuv">Yishuv</a></i>.</p>
<p>The first kibbutzniks hoped to be more than plain farmers in Palestine. They even hoped for more than a Jewish homeland there: they wanted to create a new type of <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a> where all would be equal and free from exploitation. The early kibbutzniks wanted to be both free from working for others and from the guilt of exploiting hired work. Thus was born the idea that Jews would band together, holding their property in common, "<a href="/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need" title="From each according to his ability, to each according to his need">from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs</a>."</p>
<p>Kibbutz members were not classic <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxists</a> though their system partially resembled <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a>. <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> both shared a disdain for conventional formulations of the <a href="/wiki/Nation-state" title="Nation-state" class="mw-redirect">nation-state</a>. <a href="/wiki/Leninism" title="Leninism">Leninists</a> were hostile to Zionism, but nevertheles the two main kibbutz leaders, Tabenkin and Yaari commenced in the late 1930s pushing their movements leftward to reverence of Stalin's dictatorship in order to save their leaderships. They succeeded in 1948, established Mapam party that adored the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> when supported the establishment of Israeli state, although most Kibbutz Artzi members opposed Yaari's move. Soon Stalin became hostile to Israel as it served Soviet diplomatic and military interests in the <a href="/wiki/Arab_world" title="Arab world" class="mw-redirect">Arab world</a>. This caused major crises and mass exit in both Kibbutz Meuchad and Kibbutz Artzi kibbutzim, especially after the 1953 <a href="/wiki/Doctors%27_Plot" title="Doctors' Plot" class="mw-redirect">Doctors' Plot</a> in Moscow and the Prague showcase Trials. But even after <a href="/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev" title="Nikita Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev's</a> 1956 denouncement of <a href="/wiki/Stalinism" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> in the "<a href="/wiki/On_the_Personality_Cult_and_its_Consequences" title="On the Personality Cult and its Consequences">secret speech</a>," the two leaders suppressed young leaders and the many members who rejected communism, since it served their rule.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> However, to this day many kibbutzim remain strongholds of <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" title="Left-wing politics">left-wing</a> Israeli politics.</p>
<p>Although kibbutzniks practiced a form of communism themselves, they did not believe that it could work for everyone; for example, the Kibbutz political parties never called for the abolition of <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property" class="mw-redirect">private property</a>. Kibbutzniks saw their kibbutzim as collective enterprises within a <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> system. Kibbutzim also practise active democracy in organisation: periodic elections are held for Kibbutz functions as well as an active participation in national elections. Kibbutzim today could even be seen as modeled upon a localized form of <a href="/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalist" title="Anarcho-syndicalist" class="mw-redirect">anarcho-syndicalist</a> or <a href="/wiki/Libertarian_socialist" title="Libertarian socialist" class="mw-redirect">libertarian socialist</a> and compatible with <a href="/wiki/Anarcho-capitalist" title="Anarcho-capitalist" class="mw-redirect">anarcho-capitalist</a> philosophy.</p>
<p>Kibbutzim were not the only contemporary communal enterprises: pre-war Palestine also saw the development of communal villages called <a href="/wiki/Moshav" title="Moshav">moshavim</a> (singular <i>moshav</i>). In a moshav, marketing and major farm purchases would be done collectively, but personal lives were entirely private. Although much less famous than kibbutzim, moshavim became more numerous and popular than kibbutzim after the establishment of Israel in 1948.</p>
<p>Kibbutz residents tend to vote <a href="/wiki/Left_of_center" title="Left of center" class="mw-redirect">left of center</a>.

<p>The principle of equality was taken extremely seriously up until the 1970s. Kibbutzniks did not individually own tools, or even clothing. Gifts and income received from outside were turned over to the common treasury. If a member received a gift in services—like a visit to a relative who was a dentist or a trip abroad paid for by a parent—there could be arguments at members' meetings about the propriety of accepting such a gift.</p>
<p>The arrival of children at a new kibbutz inevitably posed an ethical dilemma. If everything was held in common, then who was in charge of the children? This question was answered by regarding the children as belonging to all, even to the point of kibbutz mothers breastfeeding babies which were not their own. For most kibbutzim, the arrival of children was a sobering experience: "When we saw our first children in the playpen, hitting one another, or grabbing toys just for themselves, we were overcome with anxiety. What did it mean that even an education in communal life couldn't uproot these egotistical tendencies? The utopia of our initial social conception was slowly, slowly destroyed."<sup id="cite_ref-Segev254_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Segev254-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1920s kibbutzim began a practice of raising children communally away from their parents in special communities called "Children's Societies" (<i>Mossad Hinuchi</i>). The theory was that trained <a href="/wiki/Nurse" title="Nurse">nurses</a> and teachers would be better care-providers than amateur (and busy) parents. Children and parents would have better relationships due to the Children's Societies, since parents would not have to be <a href="/wiki/Disciplinarian" title="Disciplinarian" class="mw-redirect">disciplinarians</a>. Also, it was hoped that raising children away from parents would liberate mothers from their "biological tragedy." Instead of spending hours a day raising children, women could thus be free to work or enjoy leisure.</p>
<p>There is much to be said about the role of women on kibbutzim. In the early days there were always more men than women on kibbutzim, so naturally kibbutzim tended to be male-dominated places. Memoirs of early kibbutz life tend to show female kibbutzniks as desperate to perform the same kinds of roles as kibbutz men, from digging up rocks to planting trees. At Degania at least, it seems that the men wanted the women to continue to perform traditional female roles, such as cooking, sewing, and cleaning.</p>
<p>Eventually the men of the kibbutz gave in and permitted - and even expected - women to perform the same roles as men, including armed guard duty. The desire to liberate women from traditional maternal duties was another ideological underpinning of the Children's Society system. Interestingly, women born on kibbutzim were much less reluctant to perform traditional female roles. It was the generation of women born on kibbutzim that eventually ended the Societies of Children. Also, although there was a "masculinization of women", there was no corresponding "feminization" of men. Women may have worked the fields, but men did not work childcare.</p>
<p>Social lives were held in common as well, not only property. As an example, most kibbutz dining halls exclusively utilized benches, not as an issue of cost or convenience, but because benches were construed as another way of expressing communal values. At some kibbutzim husbands and wives were discouraged from sitting together, as marriage was an expressed form of exclusivity. In <i>The Kibbutz Community and Nation Building,</i> Paula Rayman reports that Kibbutz Har refused to buy teakettles for its members in the 1950s; the issue being not the cost but that couples owning teakettles would mean more time spent together in their apartments, rather than with the community in the dining hall.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the exclusively communal life proved hard for some. Every kibbutz saw new members quit after a few years. Since kibbutzniks had no individual bank accounts, any purchase not made at the kibbutz canteen had to be approved by a committee, a potentially humiliating and time-wasting experience. Kibbutzim also had their share of members who were not hard workers, or who abused common property; there would always be resentment against these "parasites." Finally, kibbutzim, as small, isolated communities, tended to be places of gossip, exacerbated by lack of privacy and the regimented work and leisure schedules.</p>
<p>Although major decisions about the future of the kibbutz were made by consensus or by voting, day-to-day decisions about where people would work were made by elected leaders. Typically, kibbutzniks and masakaries would learn their assignments by consulting the duty sheet at the dining hall.</p>
<p>Kibbutz memoirs from the Pioneer era report that kibbutz meetings varied from heated arguments to free-flowing philosophical discussions, whereas memoirs and accounts from kibbutz observers from the 1950s and 1960s report that kibbutz meetings were businesslike but poorly attended.</p>
<p>Kibbutzim attempted to rotate people into different jobs. One week a person might work in planting, the next with livestock, the week after in the kibbutz factory and the following week in the laundry. Even managers would have to work in menial jobs. Through rotation, people took part in every kind of work, but it interfered with any process of specialization.</p>
<p>Children's Societies were one of the features of kibbutz life that most interested outsiders. In the heyday of Children's Societies, parents would only spend two hours a day, typically in the afternoon, with their children. In Kibbutz Artzi parents were explicitly forbidden to put their children to bed at night. As children got older, parents could go for days on end without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.</p>
<p>Some children who went through Children's Societies said they loved the experience, others remain ambivalent. One vocal group maintains that growing up without one's parents was very difficult. Years later, a kibbutz member described her childhood in a Children's Society:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Allowed to suckle every four hours, left to cry and develop our lungs, we grew up without the basic security needed for survival. Sitting on the potty at regular intervals next to other children doing the same, we were educated to be the same; but we were, for all that, different… At night the grownups leave and turn off all the lights. You know you will wet the bed because it is too frightening to go to the lavatory."<sup id="cite_ref-Gavron168_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gavron168-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aversion to sex was not part of the kibbutz ideology; to this end, teenagers were not segregated at night in Children's Societies, yet many visitors to kibbutzim were astonished at how conservative the communities tended to be. In <i>Children of the Dream</i>, <a href="/wiki/Bruno_Bettelheim" title="Bruno Bettelheim">Bruno Bettelheim</a> quoted a kibbutz friend, "at a time when the American girls preen themselves, and try to show off as much as possible sexually, our girls cover themselves up and refuse to wear clothing that might show their breasts or in any other fashion be revealing." Kibbutz divorce rates were and are extremely low.<sup id="cite_ref-Bettelheim243_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bettelheim243-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Unfortunately, from the point of view of the adults in the community, marriage rates among communally raised children were equally low. This conservatism on the part of kibbutz children has been attributed to the <a href="/wiki/Westermarck_effect" title="Westermarck effect" class="mw-redirect">Westermarck effect</a>—a form of reverse sexual imprinting that causes children raised together from an early age to reject each other as potential partners, even where they are not blood relatives.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Kibbutzim had a reputation as culture-friendly and nurturing of the arts. Many kibbutzniks were and are writers, actors, or artists. Kibbutzim typically offer theater companies, choirs, orchestras, athletic leagues, and special-interest classes. In 1953 Givat Brenner staged the play <i>My Glorious Brothers,</i> about the <a href="/wiki/Maccabee" title="Maccabee" class="mw-redirect">Maccabee</a> revolt, building a real village on a hilltop as a set, planting real trees, and performing for 40,000 people. Like all kibbutz work products at the time, all the actors were members of the kibbutz, and all were ordered to perform as part of their work assignments.</p>

<p>The era of independent Israel kibbutzim attracted interest from <a href="/wiki/Sociologist" title="Sociologist" class="mw-redirect">sociologists</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychologist" title="Psychologist">psychologists</a> who attempted to answer the question: What are the effects of life without <a href="/wiki/Private_property" title="Private property" class="mw-redirect">private property</a>? What are the effects of life being brought up apart from one's parents?</p>
<p>Three researchers who wrote about psychological life on kibbutzim were <a href="/wiki/Melford_E._Spiro" title="Melford E. Spiro" class="mw-redirect">Melford E. Spiro</a> (1958) , <a href="/wiki/Bruno_Bettelheim" title="Bruno Bettelheim">Bruno Bettelheim</a> (1969) and Michael Baizerman (1963). All concluded that a kibbutz upbringing led to individuals' having greater difficulty in making strong emotional commitments thereafter, such as <a href="/wiki/Falling_in_love" title="Falling in love">falling in love</a> or forming a lasting friendship. On the other hand, they appear to find it easier to have a large number of less-involved friendships, and a more active <a href="/wiki/Social_life" title="Social life">social life</a>.</p>
<p>Bettelheim suggested that the lack of private property was the cause of the lack of emotions in kibbutzniks. He wrote, "nowhere more than in the kibbutz did I realize the degree to which private property, in the deep layers of the mind, relates to private <a href="/wiki/Emotion" title="Emotion">emotions</a>. If one is absent, the other tends to be absent as well". (See <a href="/wiki/Primitivism" title="Primitivism">primitivism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Primitive_communism" title="Primitive communism">primitive communism</a> for a general discussion of these concepts).</p>
<p>Other researchers came to a conclusion that children growing up in these tightly knit communities tended to see the other children around them as <a href="/wiki/Ersatz" title="Ersatz">ersatz</a> siblings and preferred to <a href="/wiki/Exogamy" title="Exogamy">seek mates outside the community</a> when they reached maturity. Some theorize that living amongst one another on a daily basis virtually from birth on produced an extreme version of the <a href="/wiki/Westermarck_effect#Westermarck_effect" title="Westermarck effect" class="mw-redirect">Westermarck effect</a>, which subconsciously diminished teenage kibbutzniks' sexual attraction to one another. Partly as a result of not finding a mate from within the kibbutz, youth often abandon kibbutz life as adults.</p>
<p>It is a subject of debate within the kibbutz movement as to how successful kibbutz education was in developing the talents of gifted children. Several kibbutz-raised children look back and say that the communal system stifled ambition; others say that bright children were nonetheless encouraged. Bruno Bettelheim had predicted that kibbutz education would yield mediocrity: "[kibbutz children] will not be leaders or philosophers, will not achieve anything in science or art." However, it has been noted that although kibbutzim comprise only 5% of the Israeli population, surprisingly large numbers of kibbutzniks become teachers, lawyers, doctors, and political leaders. For example 75% of Israeli air force pilots came from the kibbutz movement, as of 2006 study.<sup id="cite_ref-virg_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-virg-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Bettelheim's prediction was certainly wrong about the specific children he met at "Kibbutz Atid." In the 1990s a <a href="/wiki/Journalist" title="Journalist">journalist</a> tracked down the children Bettelheim had interviewed back in the 1960s at what was actually Kibbutz Ramat Yohanan. The journalist found that the children were highly accomplished in <a href="/wiki/Academia" title="Academia">academia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Business" title="Business">business</a>, <a href="/wiki/Music" title="Music">music</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Military" title="Military">military</a>.

<p>"The kibbutz is a magnifying glass for Israeli society," says Amia Lieblich, a professor of psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p>Since their establishment and up until the 1970s most of the kibbutzim had a common lodging system - namely the children of the kibbutz slept in special children homes (בתי ילדים) instead of their parents apartments.</p>
<p>In addition to reports by individual journalists or reporters, there is a large body of empirical research dealing with child rearing in kibbutzim. Such research has been critical of the way children are raised in a Kibbutz.</p>
<p>In a 1977 study, Fox compared the separation effects experienced by kibbutz children when removed from their mother, compared with removal from their <a href="/wiki/Caregiver" title="Caregiver">caregiver</a> (called a <i>metapelet</i> in <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>). He found that the child showed separation distress in both situations, but when reunited children were significantly more attached to their mothers than to the <i>metapelet</i>. The children protested subsequent separation from their mothers when the <i>metapelet</i> was reintroduced to them. However, kibbutzim children shared high bonding with their parents as compared to those who were sent to <a href="/wiki/Boarding_school" title="Boarding school">boarding schools</a>, because in a kibbutz a child spends three hours every day with his or her parents.</p>
<p>In another study by Scharf,<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> the group brought up in a <a href="/wiki/Communal" title="Communal" class="mw-redirect">communal</a> environment within a kibbutz showed less ability in coping with imagined situations of separation than those who were brought up with their <a href="/wiki/Family" title="Family">families</a>. This has far reaching implications for child attachment adaptability and therefore institutions like kibbutzim. These interesting kibbutz techniques are controversial with or without these studies.</p>

<p>Kibbutzim in the early days tried to be self-sufficient in all agricultural goods, from eggs to dairy to fruits to meats. Through experimentation, kibbutzniks discovered that self-sufficiency was impossible.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since October 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Kibbutzniks were also not self-sufficient when it came to capital investment. At the founding of a kibbutz, when it would be opened on land owned by the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_National_Fund" title="Jewish National Fund">Jewish National Fund</a>; for expansion, most kibbutzim were dependent on subsidies from charity or the State of Israel. Most of the subsidies took the form of low-interest loans or discounted water. In Israel, when interest rates were routinely over 30% until the 1990s and where water is expensive, these gifts came to a very great amount indeed.</p>
<p>Even prior to the establishment of the <a href="/wiki/State_of_Israel" title="State of Israel" class="mw-redirect">State of Israel</a>, kibbutzim had begun to branch out from <a href="/wiki/Agriculture" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> into <a href="/wiki/Manufacturing" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a>. Kibbutz <a href="/wiki/Degania" title="Degania">Degania</a>, for instance, set up a factory to fabricate <a href="/wiki/Diamond_cutting" title="Diamond cutting">diamond cutting</a> tools; it now grosses several million dollars a year. Kibbutz <a href="/wiki/Hatzerim" title="Hatzerim">Hatzerim</a> has a factory for <a href="/wiki/Drip_irrigation" title="Drip irrigation">drip irrigation</a> equipment. Hatzerim's business, called Netafim, is a multinational corporation that grosses over $300 million a year. Maagan Michael branched out from making bullets to making plastics and medical tools. Maagan Michael's enterprises earn over $100 million a year. A great wave of kibbutz industrialization came in the 1960s, and today only 15% of kibbutz members work in agriculture.</p>
<p>Kibbutzim industrialized at a time when agricultural jobs were not enough to absorb everyone on the kibbutz. Kibbutzim also industrialized due to pressure from the State of Israel. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Israel had one of the world's highest <a href="/wiki/Trade_deficit" title="Trade deficit" class="mw-redirect">trade deficits</a>, the state was desperate to increase exports and kibbutzim were asked to play a role.</p>
<p>The hiring of seasonal workers was always a point of controversy in the kibbutz movement. During harvest time, when hands were needed, the permissibility of hiring external workers was considered. Most kibbutzim compromised with practical exigencies and began the practice of hiring non-kibbutzniks when work was at its peak.</p>
<p>Hiring non-Jews was especially contentious. The founders of the kibbutz movement wanted to redeem the Jewish nation through work, and hiring non-Jews to do hard tasks would not be consistent with that idea. In the 1910s Kibbutz Degania vainly searched for Jewish masons to build their homes. Only when they could not find Jewish masons willing to endure the malaria of their location did they hire Arabs.</p>
<p>Today, kibbutzim have changed dramatically. Only 39% of kibbutz employees are kibbutz members<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. By the 1970s, kibbutzim were frequently hiring <a href="/wiki/Palestinians" title="Palestinians" class="mw-redirect">Palestinians</a>. Currently, <a href="/wiki/Thai_people" title="Thai people">Thais</a> have replaced Palestinians as the non-Jewish physical work element at kibbutzim. They are omnipresent in various service areas and in factories.</p>
<p><br />
As kibbutzim branched out into manufacturing in the 1960s, they are branching out into tourism and services today. Kibbutz Hatzerim even has a law firm, as well as Nahsholim. Virtually every kibbutz has guest rooms for rent. Some of these rooms are intended for traveling students, but <a href="/wiki/Kiryat_Anavim" title="Kiryat Anavim">Kiryat Anavim</a> has a luxury hotel. Several kibbutzim, such as Kibbutz Lotan and Kfar Ruppin, operate bird-watching vacations. They say that a European visitor can see more birds in one week in Israel than he or she would in a year at home<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. It is not lost on the modern kibbutz movement that kibbutzniks today are working in occupations which the first kibbutz generation condemned.</p>
<p>Many kibbutzim aggressively put money into building new enterprises, even playing the stock market. This borrowing spree caught up to the kibbutz movement in the 1980s, forcing kibbutzim to retreat from collective ideas<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. Today, most kibbutzim are at the economic break-even point, a dozen or so are very wealthy, and several score lose money. Many people who live on kibbutzim have to work outside the kibbutz. They are expected to return a percentage of their earnings to the collective.</p>

<p>Following many changes which the kibbutzim over went through the years and following the appeal made to Israeli High Court of Justice by the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition in 2001 in which the state was required to redefine the exact definition of a kibbutz in order to define the rightful benefits which the kibbutzim members should be granted by law. The reactivated legal definition was given to the <a href="/wiki/Industry,_Trade_and_Labour_Minister_of_Israel" title="Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel">Industry, Trade and Labour Minister of Israel</a> on the December 15, 2005 (תקנות סיווג הקיבוצים).

The petitioners argued that the Kibbutz had dramatically changed its life style, having implemented differential salaries, closing the communal dining room, and privatizing the educational system and other services. These changes did not fit the legal definition of a kibbutz, and in particular, the principle of equality in consumption. Consequently, the registrar of cooperative societies, who has the authority to register and classify cooperative societies, should change the classification of kibbutz Beit Oren. The kibbutz responded that it still maintained the basic principles of a kibbutz, but the changes made were vital to prevent a financial collapse and to improve the economic situation.</p>
<p>This case resulted in the Government establishing a committee to recommend a new legal definitions that will suit the development of the kibbutz, and to submit an opinion on the ifallocation of apartments to kibbutz members. The committee submitted a detailed report with two new legal classifications to the settlements known today as kibbutzim. The first classification was named 'communal kibbutz' which was identical to the traditional definition of a kibbutz. The second classification, was called the 'renewing kibbutz', which included developments and changes in lifestyle, provided that the basic principles of mutual guarantee and equality are preserved. In light of the above, the committee recommended that instead of the current legal definition of kibbutz, two different determinations will be created, as follows, a) <i>communal kibbutz</i>: a society for settlement, being a separate settlement, organized on the basis of collective ownership of possession, of self employment, and of equality and cooperation in production, consumption and education, b) <i>renewing kibbutz</i>: a society for settlement, being a separate settlement, organized on the basis of collective partnership in possession, of self employment, and of equality and cooperation in production, consumption and education, that maintains mutual guarantee among its members, and its articles of association includes, some or all of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>relative wages according to the individual contribution or to seniority allocation of apartments</li>
<li>allocation of productive means to its members, excluding land, water</li>
<li>productive quotas, provided that the cooperative society will maintain control over the productive means and that the articles of association restrict the negotiability of allocated productive means.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></li>

<p>In his history of Palestine under the British Mandate, <i>One Palestine, Complete</i>, "<a href="/wiki/New_Historian" title="New Historian" class="mw-redirect">New Historian</a>" <a href="/wiki/Tom_Segev" title="Tom Segev">Tom Segev</a> wrote of the kibbutz movement:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The kibbutz was an original social creation, yet always a marginal phenomenon. By the end of the 1920s no more than 4,000 people, children included, lived on some thirty kibbutzim, and they amounted to a mere 2.5% of Palestine’s Jewish population. The most important service the kibbutzim provided to the Jewish national struggle was military, not economic or social. They were guardians of Zionist land, and their patterns of settlement would to a great extent determine the country’s borders. The kibbutzim also had a powerful effect on the Zionist self-image.<sup id="cite_ref-Segev252_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Segev252-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>As against this characterization, numerous students found kibbutzim played major role in agricultural innovation that advanced the Israeli agriculture to leading the world in some sectors, for instance irrigation. In later era many of their factories led Israel efforts to gain economic independence by production for export, while their political involvement was of major importance up to 1948. The Kibbutz Meuchad and Kibbutz Artzi manaced Ben-Gurion's dominance of Yishuv politics in the 1940s, but they failed gaining wide public support in Israeli elections ever since 1949 because of reverance of Stalin's dictatorship which most Israelis denounced.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> Kibbutzim have been criticized for falling short of living up to their own ideals. Most kibbutzim are not self-sufficient and have to employ non-kibbutz members as farm workers (or later factory workers). What was particularly controversial was the employment of Arab labourers while excluding them from the possibility of joining the Kibbutz as full members.</p>
<p>In more recent decades, some kibbutzim have been criticized for "abandoning" socialist principles and turning to <a href="/wiki/Capitalism" title="Capitalism">capitalist</a> projects in order to make the kibbutz more self-sufficient economically. <a href="/wiki/Shamir_(kibbutz)" title="Shamir (kibbutz)" class="mw-redirect">Kibbutz Shamir</a> owns an optical products company that is listed on the <a href="/wiki/NASDAQ" title="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> stock exchange. Numerous kibbutzim have moved away from farming and developed parts of their property for commercial and industrial purposes, building shopping malls and factories on kibbutz land that serve and employ non kibbutz members while the kibbutz retains a profit from land rentals or sales. Conversely, kibbutzim which have not engaged in this sort of development have also been criticized for becoming dependent on state subsidies to survive.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, kibbutzniks played a role in yishuv society and then Israeli society, far out of proportion to their population, and many kibbutzniks have served Israel in positions of leadership. The Tower and Stockade system by which 52 settlements from 1938 to 1947 largely decided the borders of Israel in the UN 29 November 1947 decision, was invention of kibbutz member Shlomo Gur. The establishment of the Palmach underground army in 1942 which won the yishuv crucial military struggle against Palstinian Arabs from 30 November 1947 up to 15 May 1948 that made possible the establishment of the Israeli state, was due to efforts by Tabenkin and other Kibbutz Meuchad leaders. One of them, Igaal Alon and Kibbutz Artzi member Shimon Avidan were the two most important commanders who won the War of Independence, and numerous kibbutz members were Cabinet Ministers who largely shaped Israeli politics form 1955 to 1977.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Kibbutz born <a href="/wiki/Ehud_Barak" title="Ehud Barak">Ehud Barak</a> was Prime Minister from 1999 to 2001, and <a href="/wiki/David_Ben_Gurion" title="David Ben Gurion" class="mw-redirect">David Ben Gurion</a> lived most of his life in Tel Aviv, but joined Kibbutz <a href="/wiki/Sde_Boker" title="Sde Boker">Sde Boker</a> in the Negev after resigning from Prime Minister in 1963.</p>
<p>Kibbutzim also contributed greatly to the growing Hebrew culture movement. The poet <a href="/wiki/Rachel_(poet)" title="Rachel (poet)" class="mw-redirect">Rachel</a> rhapsodized on the landscape from viewpoints from various Galilee kibbutzim in the 1920s and 1930s. The kibbutz dream of "making the desert bloom" became part of the Israeli dream as well.</p>
<p>Books and movies about Israel, from <a href="/wiki/James_A._Michener" title="James A. Michener">James Michener</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Source_(novel)" title="The Source (novel)">The Source</a></i> to <a href="/wiki/Leon_Uris" title="Leon Uris">Leon Uris</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/Exodus_(novel)" title="Exodus (novel)">Exodus</a></i>, feature kibbutzniks prominently. Kibbutz life is also featured prominently in the 2006 film <i><a href="/wiki/Sixty_Six_(film)" title="Sixty Six (film)">Sixty Six</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>. The stereotypical image of the kibbutznik—tanned and wearing a sunhat with a fold-down brim became the stereotypical image of all Israelis.</p>

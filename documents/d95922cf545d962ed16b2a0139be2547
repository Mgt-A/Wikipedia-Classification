<p><a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> believed that children would never learn unless they wanted to learn. In <i><a href="/wiki/Republic_(Plato)" title="Republic (Plato)" class="mw-redirect">The Republic</a></i>, he said, "...compulsory learning never sticks in the mind." An important educational debate in the time of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> arose after Christianity had achieved broad acceptance. The question concerned the educational value of pre-Christian classical thought: "Given that the body of knowledge of the pre-Christian Romans was heathen in origin, was it safe to teach it to Christian children?"<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>Though educational reform undoubtedly occurred on a local level at various points throughout history, the modern notion of education reform is tied with the spread of <a href="/wiki/Compulsory_education" title="Compulsory education">Compulsory education</a> - education reforms did not become widespread until after organized schooling was sufficiently systematized to be 'reformed.'</p>
<p>In the modern world, economic growth and the spread of democracy have raised the value of education and increased the importance of ensuring that all children and adults have access to high quality and effective education. Modern education reforms are increasingly driven by a growing understanding of what works in education and how to go about successfully improving teaching and learning in schools. <sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Western <a href="/wiki/Classical_education" title="Classical education">classical education</a> as taught from the 18th to the 19th century has weaknesses that inspired reformers.</p>
<p>Classical education is most concerned with answering the who, what, where, when and why? questions that concern a majority of students. Unless carefully taught, group instruction naturally neglects the theoretical "why" and "which" questions that strongly concern a minority of students.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Classical education in this period also depreciated local languages and cultures in favor of ancient languages (Greek and Latin) and their cultures. This produced odd social effects in which an intellectual class might be more loyal to ancient cultures and institutions than to their native vernacular languages and their actual governing authorities.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>Before the advent of government-funded public schools, the primary mode of education for those of the lower classes was the charity school, pioneered during the 1800s by <a href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant" class="mw-redirect">Protestant</a> organizations and adapted for use by the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and governmental bodies. Because these schools operated on very small budgets and attempted to serve as many needy children as possible, economic factors were prominent in their design.</p>
<p>The basic program was to develop "grammar" schools. These taught only grammar and <a href="/wiki/Bookkeeping" title="Bookkeeping">bookkeeping</a>. This program permits people to start businesses to make money, and gives them the skills to continue their education inexpensively from books. "Grammar" was the first third of the then-prevalent system of <a href="/wiki/Classical_education" title="Classical education">Classical education</a>.</p>
<p>The ultimate development of the grammar school was by <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Lancaster" title="Joseph Lancaster">Joseph Lancaster</a>, who started as an impoverished <a href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a> in early 19th century <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. Lancaster used slightly more-advanced students to teach less-advanced students, achieving student-teacher ratios as small as 2, while educating more than a thousand students per adult. Lancaster promoted his system in a piece called <a href="http://www.constitution.org/lanc/improv-1803.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.constitution.org/lanc/improv-1803.htm" rel="nofollow">Improvements in Education</a> that spread widely throughout the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>Discipline and labour in a Lancaster school were provided by an economic system. Scrip, a form of money meaningless outside the school, was created at a fixed exchange rate from a student's tuition. Every job of the school was bid-for by students in scrip. The highest bid won. The jobs permitted students to collect scrip from other students for services rendered. However, <i>any</i> student tutor could auction positions in his or her classes. Besides tutoring, students could use scrip to buy food, school supplies, books, and childish luxuries in a school store. The adult supervisors were paid from the bids on jobs.</p>
<p>With fully-developed internal economies, Lancaster schools provided a grammar-school education for a cost per student near $40 per year in 1999 U.S. dollars. The students were very clever at reducing their costs, and once invented, improvements were widely adopted in a school. For example, Lancaster students, motivated to save scrip, ultimately rented individual pages of textbooks from the school library, and read them in groups around music stands to reduce textbook costs. Exchanges of tutoring, and using receipts from "down tutoring" to pay for "up tutoring" were commonplace.</p>
<p>Established educational elites found Lancaster schools so threatening that most English-speaking countries developed mandatory publicly-paid education explicitly to keep public education in "responsible" hands. These elites said that Lancaster schools might become dishonest, provide poor education and were not accountable to established authorities. Lancaster's supporters responded that any schoolchild could avoid cheats, given the opportunity, and that the government was not paying for the education, and thus deserved no say in their composition.</p>
<p>Lancaster, though motivated by charity, claimed in his pamphlets to be surprised to find that he lived well on the income of his school, even while the low costs made it available to the poorest street-children. Ironically, Lancaster lived on the charity of friends in his later life.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The term <i>progressive</i> in education has been used somewhat indiscriminately; there are a number of kinds of <a href="/wiki/Educational_progressivism" title="Educational progressivism" class="mw-redirect">educational progressivism</a>, most of the historically significant kinds peaking in the period between the late 19th and the middle of the 20th centuries.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> has been called the father of the child-study movement. It has been said that Rousseau "discovered" the child (as an object of study).</p>
<p>Rousseau's principal work on education is <i><a href="/wiki/Emile:_Or,_On_Education" title="Emile: Or, On Education" class="mw-redirect">Emile: Or, On Education</a></i>, in which he lays out an educational program for a hypothetical newborn's education to adulthood. Rousseau provided a dual critique of both the vision of education set forth in <a href="/wiki/Plato%27s_Republic" title="Plato's Republic" class="mw-redirect">Plato's Republic</a> and also of the society of his contemporary Europe and the educational methods he regarded as contributing to it; he held that a person can either be a man or a citizen, and that while Plato's plan could have brought the latter at the expense of the former, contemporary education failed at both tasks. He advocated a radical withdrawal of the child from society and an educational process that utilized the natural potential of the child and its curiosity, teaching it by confronting it with simulated real-life obstacles and conditioning it by experience rather than teaching it intellectually. His ideas were rarely implemented directly, but were influential on later thinkers, particularly <a href="/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi" title="Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Fr%C3%B6bel" title="Friedrich Fröbel">Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel</a>, the inventor of the <a href="/wiki/Kindergarten" title="Kindergarten">kindergarten</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/H._D._Thoreau" title="H. D. Thoreau" class="mw-redirect">H. D. Thoreau</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Walden" title="Walden">Walden</a></i> and reform essays in the mid-19th century were influential also (see the anthology <i>Uncommon Learning: Henry David Thoreau on Education</i>, Boston, 1999). For a look at <a href="/wiki/Transcendentalist" title="Transcendentalist" class="mw-redirect">transcendentalist</a> life, read <a href="/wiki/Louisa_May_Alcott" title="Louisa May Alcott">Louisa May Alcott</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Little_Women" title="Little Women">Little Women</a></i>.

<p>The transcendental education movement failed, because only the most gifted students ever equaled the skills of their classically-educated teachers.

<p>Education is often seen in Europe and Asia as an important system to maintain national, cultural and linguistic unity. <a href="/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussia</a> instituted primary school reforms expressly to teach a unified version of the national language, "Hochdeutsch". One significant reform was <a href="/wiki/Kindergarten" title="Kindergarten">kindergarten</a>, whose purpose was to have the children spend time in supervised activities in the national language, when the children were young enough that they could easily learn new language skills.</p>
<p>Since most modern schools copy the <a href="/wiki/Prussia" title="Prussia">Prussian</a> models, children start school at an age when their language skills remain plastic, and they find it easy to learn the national language. This was an intentional design on the part of the Prussians.</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" title="John Dewey">John Dewey</a>, a philosopher and educator, was heavily influential in American and international education, especially during the first four decades of the twentieth century. An important member of the American <a href="/wiki/Pragmatism" title="Pragmatism">Pragmatist</a> movement, he carried the subordination of knowledge to action into the educational world by arguing for experiential education that would enable children to learn theory and practice simultaneously; a well-known example is the practice of teaching elementary physics and biology to students while preparing a meal. He was a harsh critic of "dead" knowledge disconnected from practical human life, foreshadowing <a href="/wiki/Paulo_Freire" title="Paulo Freire">Paulo Freire</a>'s attack on the "banking concept of education."</p>
<p>Dewey criticized the rigidity and volume of humanistic education, and the emotional idealizations of education based on the child-study movement that had been inspired by Bill Joel and those who followed him. He presented his educational theories as a synthesis of the two views. His slogan was that schools should encourage children to "Learn by doing."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> He wanted people to realize that children are naturally active and curious. Dewey's understanding of logic is best presented in his "Logic, the Theory of Inquiry" (1938). His educational theories were presented in "My Pedagogic Creed", <i>The School and Society</i>, <i>The Child and Curriculum</i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Democracy_and_Education" title="Democracy and Education">Democracy and Education</a></i> (1916).</p>
<p>The question of the history of Deweyan educational practice is a difficult one. He was a widely known and influential thinker, but his views and suggestions were often misunderstood by those who sought to apply them, leading some historians to suggest that there was never an actual implementation on any considerable scale of Deweyan progressive education.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> The schools with which Dewey himself was most closely associated (though the most famous, the "Laboratory School", was really run by his wife) had considerable ups and downs, and Dewey left the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> in 1904 over issues relating to the Dewey School.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Dewey's influence began to decline in the time after the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a> and particularly in the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> era, as more conservative educational policies came to the fore.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Education_reform&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: The administrative progressives">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The administrative progressives</span></h3>
<p>The form of educational progressivism which was most successful in having its policies implemented has been dubbed "administrative progressivism" by historians. This began to be implemented in the early 20th century. While influenced particularly in its rhetoric by Dewey and even more by his popularizers, administrative progressivism was in its practice much more influenced by the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_revolution" title="Industrial revolution" class="mw-redirect">industrial revolution</a> and the concept <a href="/wiki/Economies_of_scale" title="Economies of scale" class="mw-redirect">economies of scale</a>.</p>
<p>The administrative progressives are responsible for many features of modern American education, especially American high schools: counseling programs, the move from many small local high schools to large centralized high schools, curricular differentiation in the form of electives and tracking, curricular, professional, and other forms of standardization, and an increase in state and federal regulation and bureaucracy, with a corresponding reduction of local control at the school board level. (Cf. "State, federal, and local control of education in the United States", below) (Tyack and Cuban, pp. 17-26)</p>
<p>These reforms have since become heavily entrenched, and many today who identify themselves as progressives are opposed to many of them, while conservative education reform during the Cold War embraced them as a framework for strengthening traditional curriculum and standards.</p>
<p>In more recent times, groups such as the think tank <a href="/wiki/Reform_(think_tank)" title="Reform (think tank)">Reform's</a> education division, and <a href="/w/index.php?title=S.E.R.&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="S.E.R.

<p>Many progressive reforms failed to transfer learned skills. Evidence suggests that higher-order thinking skills are unused by many people (cf. <a href="/wiki/Jean_Piaget" title="Jean Piaget">Jean Piaget</a>, <a href="/wiki/Isabel_Myers" title="Isabel Myers" class="mw-redirect">Isabel Myers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Katharine_Cook_Briggs" title="Katharine Cook Briggs" class="mw-redirect">Katharine Cook Briggs</a>). Some authorities say that this refutes key assumptions of progressive thinkers such as Dewey.</p>
<p>Jean Piaget was a Swiss psychologist who studied people's developmental stages. He showed by widely reproduced experiments that most young children do not analyze or synthesize as Dewey expected. Some authorities therefore say that Dewey's reforms do not apply to the primary education of young children.</p>
<p>Katherine Briggs and her daughter Isabel Myers developed a psychological test that reproducibly identifies sixteen distinct human temperaments, building on work by <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" title="Carl Jung">Jung</a>. A wide class of temperaments ("Sensors", half by category, 60% of the general population) prefer not to use non-concrete information such as theories or logical inference.</p>
<p>In terms of education, some authorities interpret this to mean that 60% of the general population only use, and therefore would prefer to learn answers to concrete "Who, what, when, where", and "how" questions, rather than answers to the theoretical "which" and "why" questions advocated by progressives.</p>
<p>This information was confirmed (on another research track) by Jean Piaget, who discovered that nearly 60% of adults never habitually use what he called "<a href="/wiki/Formal_Operational_stage" title="Formal Operational stage" class="mw-redirect">formal operational reasoning</a>," a term for the development and use of theories and explicit logic.</p>
<p>If this criticism is true, then schools that teach only <i>principles</i> would fail to educate 60% of the general population.</p>
<p>The data from Piaget, Myers and Briggs can also be used to criticize classical teaching styles that <i>never</i> teach theory or principle. In particular, a wide class of temperaments ("Intuitives", half by category, 40% of the general population) prefer to reason from trusted first principles, and then apply that theory to predict concrete facts.</p>
<p>In terms of education, some authorities interpret this to mean that 40% of the general population prefer to use, and therefore want to learn, answers to theoretical "Which and "Why" questions, rather than answers to the concrete "Who, what, when, where" and "How" questions.</p>
<p>The synthesis resulting from this two-part critique is a "neoclassical" learning theory similar to that practiced by <a href="/wiki/Marva_Collins" title="Marva Collins">Marva Collins</a>, in which both learning styles are accommodated. The classroom is filled with facts, that are organized with theories, providing a rich environment to feed children's natural preferences. To reduce the limitations of depending only on natural preferences, all children are required to learn both important facts, and important forms of reasoning.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Diane_Ravitch" title="Diane Ravitch">Diane Ravitch</a> argues that "progressive" reformers have replaced a challenging liberal arts curriculum with ever-lower standards and indoctrination, particularly in inner-city schools, thereby preventing vast numbers of students from achieving their full potential.</p>

<p>Although many people have claimed that U.S. public schools are underfunded, there are few countries that spend as much per student on education. However, the United States is well known for huge inequalities in the economics of school districts.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Among developed countries, there is almost no correlation between spending on education and educational performance. Top performers include Singapore, Finland and Korea, all with relatively low spending on education, while high spenders including Norway and Luxembourg have relatively low performance. <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> However, within countries, differences in spending between schools or districts may accentuate inequalities if they result in the best teachers moving to teach in the most wealthy areas.</p>
<p>According to a 2005 report from the <a href="/wiki/OECD" title="OECD" class="mw-redirect">OECD</a>, the United States is tied for first place with Switzerland when it comes to annual spending per student on its public schools, with each of those two countries spending more than $11,000 (in U.S. currency).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite this high level of funding, U.S. public schools lag behind the schools of other rich countries in the areas of reading, math, and science.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to a 2007 article in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i>, the Washington D.C. public school district spends $12,979 per student per year. This is the third highest level of funding per student out of the 100 biggest school districts in the U.S. Despite this high level of funding, the school district provides outcomes that are lower than the national average. In reading and math, the district's students score the lowest among 11 major school districts--even when poor children are compared only with other poor children. Thirty-three percent of poor fourth graders in the U.S. lack basic skills in math, but in Washington D.C., it's 62%.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to a 2006 study by the <a href="/wiki/Goldwater_Institute" title="Goldwater Institute">Goldwater Institute</a>, Arizona's public schools spend 50% more per student than Arizona's private schools. The study also says that while teachers constitute 72% of the employees at private schools, they make up less than half of the staff at public schools. According to the study, if Arizona's public schools wanted to be like private schools, they would have to hire approximately 25,000 more teachers, and eliminate 21,210 administration employees. The study also said that public school teachers are paid about 50% more than private school teachers.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1985 in Kansas City, Missouri, a judge ordered the school district to raise taxes and spend more money on public education. Spending was increased so much, that the school district was spending more money per student than any of the country's other 280 largest school districts. Although this very high level of spending continued for more than a decade, there was no improvement in the school district's academic performance.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Education reform has been pursued for a variety of specific reasons, but generally most reforms aim at redressing some societal ills, such as <a href="/wiki/Poverty" title="Poverty">poverty</a>-, <a href="/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a>-, or <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">class</a>-based inequities, or perceived ineffectiveness. Reforms are usually proposed by thinkers who aim to redress societal ills or institute societal changes, most often through a change in the education of the members of a class of people—the preparation of a ruling class to rule or a working class to work, the social hygiene of a lower or immigrant class, the preparation of citizens in a democracy or republic, etc. The idea that all children should be provided with a high level of education is a relatively recent idea, and has arisen largely in the context of Western <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> in the 20th century.</p>
<p>The "beliefs" of school districts are optimistic that quite literally "all students will succeed", which in the context of <a href="/w/index.php?title=High_school_graduation_exams&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="High school graduation exams (page does not exist)">high school graduation exams</a>, all students in all groups, regardess of heritage or income will pass tests that in the introduction typically fall beyond the ability of all but the top 20 to 30 percent of students. The claims clearly renounce historical research that shows that all ethnic and income groups score differently on all <a href="/wiki/Standardized_test" title="Standardized test">standardized tests</a> and <a href="/wiki/Standards_based_assessment" title="Standards based assessment" class="mw-redirect">standards based assessments</a> and that students will achieve on a <a href="/wiki/Bell_curve" title="Bell curve">bell curve</a>. Instead, education officials across the world believe that by setting clear, achievable, higher standards, aligning the curriculum, and assessing outcomes, learning can be increased for all students, and more students can succeed than the 50 percent who are defined to be above or below grade level by norm referenced standards.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Sovereign_state" title="Sovereign state">States</a> have tried to use <a href="/wiki/State_school" title="State school">state schools</a> to increase state power, especially to make better <a href="/wiki/Soldier" title="Soldier">soldiers</a> and workers. This strategy was first adopted to unify related linguistic groups in <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>. Exact mechanisms are unclear, but it often fails in areas where populations are culturally segregated, as when the U.S. Indian school service failed to suppress <a href="/wiki/Lakota_language" title="Lakota language">Lakota</a> and <a href="/wiki/Navajo_people" title="Navajo people">Navaho</a>, or when a culture has widely respected autonomous cultural institutions, as when the <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spanish</a> failed to suppress <a href="/wiki/Catalonia" title="Catalonia">Catalan</a>.</p>
<p>Many students of <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a> have desired to improve education in order to improve the quality of governance in democratic societies; the necessity of good public education follows logically if one believes that the quality of democratic governance depends on the ability of citizens to make informed, intelligent choices, and that education can improve these abilities.</p>
<p>Politically-motivated educational reforms of the democratic type are recorded as far back as <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Plato%27s_Republic" title="Plato's Republic" class="mw-redirect">The Republic</a></i>. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America" class="mw-redirect">United States of America</a>, this lineage of democratic education reform was continued by <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, who advocated ambitious reforms partly along Platonic lines for <a href="/wiki/Public_education" title="Public education">public schooling</a> in <a href="/wiki/Virginia" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>Another motivation for reform is the desire to address socio-economic problems, which many people see as having significant roots in lack of education. Starting in the twentieth century, people have attempted to argue that small improvements in education can have large returns in such areas as health, wealth and well-being. For example, in <a href="/wiki/Kerala" title="Kerala">Kerala</a>, India in the 1950s, increases in women's health were correlated with increases in female literacy rates. In <a href="/wiki/Iran" title="Iran">Iran</a>, increased primary education was correlated with increased farming efficiencies and income. In both cases some researchers have concluded these correlations as representing an underlying causal relationship: education causes socio-economic benefits. In the case of Iran, researchers concluded that the improvements were due to farmers gaining reliable access to national crop prices and scientific farming information.</p>

<p>Web-based international educational software is under development by students at New York University, based on the belief that current educational institutions are too rigid: effective teaching is not routine, students are not passive, and questions of practice are not predictable or standardized. The software allows for courses tailored to an individual's abilities through frequent and automatic <a href="/wiki/Multiple_intelligences" title="Multiple intelligences" class="mw-redirect">multiple intelligences</a> assessments. Ultimate goals include assisting students to be intrinsically motivated to educate themselves, and aiding the student in self-actualization. Courses typically taught only in college are being reformatted so that they can be taught to any level of student, whereby elementary school students may learn the foundations of any topic they desire. Such a program has the potential to remove the bureaucratic inefficiencies of education in modern countries, and with the decreasing digital divide, help developing nations rapidly achieve a similar quality of education. With an open format similar to Wikipedia, any teacher may upload their courses online and a feedback system will help students choose relevant courses of the highest quality. Teachers can provide links in their digital courses to webcast videos of their lectures. Students will have personal academic profiles and a forum will allow students to pose complex questions, while simpler questions will be automatically answered by the software, which will bring you to a solution by searching through the knowledge database, which includes all available courses and topics.</p>

<p>Some of the methods and reforms have gained permanent advocates, and are widely utilized.</p>
<p>Many educators now believe that anything that more precisely meets the needs of the child will work better. This was initiated by <a href="/wiki/Maria_Montessori" title="Maria Montessori">M. Montessori</a> and is still utilized in <a href="/wiki/Montessori_school" title="Montessori school" class="mw-redirect">Montessori schools</a>.</p>
<p>The teaching method must be teachable! This is a lesson from both Montessori and Dewey. This view now has very wide currency, and is used to select much of the curricula of teachers' colleges.</p>
<p>Conservative programs are often based on <a href="/wiki/Classical_education_movement" title="Classical education movement">classical education</a>, which is seen by conservatives to reliably teach valuable skills in a developmentally appropriate order to the majority of <a href="/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator" title="Myers-Briggs Type Indicator">Myers-Briggs</a> temperaments, by teaching facts.</p>
<p>Programs that test individual learning, and teach to mastery of a subject have been proven by the state of Kentucky to be far more effective than group instruction with compromise schedules, or even class-size reduction (see reference to KERA, below)</p>
<p>Schools with limited resources, such as most public schools and most third-world and missionary schools, use a grammar-school approach. The evidence of Lancaster schools suggests using students as teachers. If the culture supports it, perhaps the economic discipline of the Lancaster school can reduce costs even further. However, much of the success of Lancaster's "school economy" was that the children were natives of an intensely mercantile culture.</p>
<p>In order to be effective, classroom instruction needs to change subjects at times near a typical student's attention span, which can be as frequently as every two minutes for young children. This is an important part of <a href="/wiki/Marva_Collins" title="Marva Collins">Marva Collins</a>' method.</p>
<p>The Myers-Briggs temperaments fall into four broad categories, each sufficiently different to justify completely different educational theories. Many developmental psychologists say that it might be socially profitable to test for and target temperaments with special curricula.</p>
<p>Some of the Myers-Briggs temperaments are known to despise educational material that lacks theory. Therefore, effective curricula need to raise and answer "which" and "why" questions, to teach students with "intuitive" (Myers-Briggs) modalities.</p>
<p>Philosophers identify independent, <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logical reasoning</a> as a precondition to most western science, engineering, economic and political theory. Therefore, every educational program that desires to improve students' outcomes in political, health and economic behavior should include a Socratically-taught set of classes to teach logic and critical thinking.</p>
<p>Substantial resources and time can be saved by permitting students to test out of classes. This also increases motivation, directs individual study, and reduces boredom and disciplinary problems.</p>
<p>To support inexpensive continuing <a href="/wiki/Adult_education" title="Adult education">adult education</a> a community needs a free public library. It can start modestly as shelves in an attended shop or government building, with donated books. Attendants are essential to protect the books from vandalism. Adult education repays itself many times over by providing direct opportunity to adults. Free libraries are also powerful resources for schools and businesses.</p>
<p>New programs based on modern <a href="/wiki/Learning_theory_(education)" title="Learning theory (education)">learning theories</a> should be quantitatively investigated for effectiveness, as was done by KERA (see reference, below).</p>
<p>A notable reform of the education system of <a href="http://www.libraryreference.org/edreform.html" class="external text" title="http://www.libraryreference.org/edreform.html" rel="nofollow">Massachusetts</a> occurred in 1993.</p>
<p>The current <b><a href="/wiki/Student_voice" title="Student voice">student voice</a></b> effort echoes past school reform initiatives focusing on <a href="/w/index.php?title=Parent_involvement&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Parent involvement (page does not exist)">parent involvement</a>, community involvement, and other forms of participation in schools. However, it is finding a significant amount of success in schools because of the inherent differences: <a href="/wiki/Student_voice" title="Student voice">student voice</a> is central to the daily schooling experience because students spend all day there. Many educators today strive for meaningful student involvement in their classrooms, while school administrators, school board members, and elected officials each lurch to hear what students have to say.</p>

<p>In other parts of the world, educational reform has had a number of different meanings. In <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> in the 1990s and 2000s a movement tried to prioritize reasoning over mere facts, reduce the emphasis on central control and standardized testing. There was consensus on the problems. Efforts were limited because there was little consensus on the goals of educational reforms, and therefore on how to fix the problems. By 2003, the push for education reform had declined.</p>

<p>In August 1915, the Merton family left Prades for the United States because of the difficulties of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>. They settled first with Ruth's parents on <a href="/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, and then near them in <a href="/wiki/Douglaston" title="Douglaston" class="mw-redirect">Douglaston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a>. In 1917, the family moved into an old house in <a href="/wiki/Flushing,_NY" title="Flushing, NY" class="mw-redirect">Flushing, NY</a>, where Merton's brother John Paul was born on 2 November 1918.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The family was considering returning to France, when Ruth was diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Stomach_cancer" title="Stomach cancer">stomach cancer</a>, from which she died on 21 October 1921, in <a href="/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital" title="Bellevue Hospital" class="mw-redirect">Bellevue Hospital</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>.

<p>In 1922, Owen and Tom traveled to <a href="/wiki/Bermuda" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, having left John Paul with his in-laws, the Jenkins family, in Douglaston.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> While the trip was short, Owen managed to fall in love with the American <a href="/wiki/Novelist" title="Novelist" class="mw-redirect">novelist</a> Evelyn Scott, then married to Cyril Kay-Scott. Still grieving his mother, Tom never quite hit it off with Evelyn. Evelyn's son, Creighton, later said that his mother was verbally abusive to Thomas during their stay.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Happy to get away from the company of Evelyn, in 1923 Tom returned to Douglaston to live with the Jenkins family and his brother John Paul. Owen, Evelyn and her husband Cyril set sail for Europe, traveling through <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Algeria" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>. Thomas later half-jokingly referred to this odd trio as "the Bermuda Triangle". During the winter of 1924, while in Algeria, Owen became ill and was thought to be near death. In retrospect, the illness could have been an early symptom of the <a href="/wiki/Brain_tumor" title="Brain tumor">brain tumor</a> that eventually took his life. The news of his father's illness weighed heavily on Thomas. The prospect of losing his sole surviving parent filled him with anxiety.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By March 1925, Owen was well enough to organize a show at the Leicester Galleries, <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. That summer he returned to New York and then took Tom with him to live in <a href="/wiki/Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val" title="Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val">Saint-Antonin</a> in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>. Tom returned to France with mixed feelings, as he had lived with his grandparents for the last two years and had become attached to them.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> During their travels, Owen and Evelyn had discussed marriage on occasion. After the trip to New York, Owen realized it could not work, as Tom would not be reconciled to Evelyn. Unwilling to sacrifice his son for the romance, he broke off the relationship.</p>

The stay brought up feelings of loneliness and depression for Thomas, as he felt deserted by his father. During his initial months of schooling, Merton begged his father to remove him. Yet, as time passed, Merton gradually became more comfortable with his surroundings there. He made friends with a circle of young and aspiring writers at the lycée and came to write two novels.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Sundays at Lycée Ingres offered nearby <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> mass, but Tom never attended. He typically managed to visit home on such days. A Protestant preacher would come to teach on Sundays at the Lycée, for those who did not attend mass, but Tom showed no interest. During the <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> breaks of 1926 and 1927, Merton spent his time with friends of his father in <a href="/wiki/Murat" title="Murat">Murat</a> (a small town in the <a href="/wiki/Auvergne_(region)" title="Auvergne (region)">Auvergne</a>). He admired the devout Catholic couple, whom he saw as good and decent people, though Catholicism never came up as a topic between them. Owen was off painting and attending exhibits and galleries showing his work. Most of the time he spent in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. In the summer of 1928, Owen came and took Tom out of Lycée Ingres, informing him that they were headed together to <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>.</p>

<p>Merton and his father moved to the home of Owen's aunt and uncle in <a href="/wiki/Ealing" title="Ealing">Ealing</a>, in west <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. Merton was soon enrolled in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Ripley_Court_School&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ripley Court School (page does not exist)">Ripley Court School</a>, another boarding school, this one in <a href="/wiki/Ripley,_Surrey" title="Ripley, Surrey">Surrey</a>. Merton enjoyed his studies there and benefited from a greater sense of community than had existed at the lycée. On Sundays, all students attended services at the local <a href="/wiki/Anglican" title="Anglican" class="mw-redirect">Anglican</a> church. Merton began routinely praying, but discontinued the practice after leaving the school.</p>
<p>During his holidays, Merton stayed at his great-aunt and uncle's home, where occasionally his father would visit. During the Easter vacation, 1929, Merton and Owen went to <a href="/wiki/Canterbury" title="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. Merton enjoyed the countryside around Canterbury, taking long walks there. After the holiday ended, Owen returned to France and Merton, to Ripley. Towards the end of that year, Thomas Merton learned the news that his father was ill and living in Ealing. Merton went to see him and together they left for a friend's house in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> who offered a place for Owen to recover. Shortly after, Owen was taken to London to the <a href="/wiki/North_Middlesex_Hospital" title="North Middlesex Hospital">North Middlesex Hospital</a>. Merton soon learned his father had a brain tumor. He took the news badly, but later, when he visited Owen in the hospital, the latter seemed to be recovering. This helped ease some of Merton's anxiety.</p>
<p>In 1930, Merton stayed at <a href="/wiki/Oakham_School" title="Oakham School">Oakham School</a>, a boarding school in <a href="/wiki/Rutland" title="Rutland">Rutland</a>, England. He was successful there. At the end of the first year, his grandparents and John Paul visited him. His grandfather discussed his finances, telling him he would be provided for if Owen died. Merton and the family spent most of that summer visiting his father in hospital, who was so ill he could no longer speak. This caused Merton much pain. On 16 January 1931, just as the term at Oakham had restarted, Owen died. Tom Bennett, Owen Merton's physician and former classmate in New Zealand, became Merton's legal guardian. He let Merton use his house in London, which was unoccupied, during the Oakham holidays.</p>
<p>That same year, Merton visited <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a> in <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> for a week. He also saw his grandparents in New York during the summer. Upon his return to Oakham, Merton became joint editor of the school magazine the <i>Oakhamian</i>. In 1932, he passed the entrance exam for <a href="/wiki/Clare_College" title="Clare College" class="mw-redirect">Clare College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cambridge" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. On his 18th birthday, tasting new freedom, Merton went off on his own. He stopped off in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marseilles" title="Marseilles" class="mw-redirect">Marseilles</a>, then walked to <a href="/wiki/Hyeres" title="Hyeres" class="mw-redirect">Hyeres</a>, where he ran out of money and wired Bennett for more. Scoldingly Bennett granted his request, which may have shown Merton he cared. Merton then walked to <a href="/wiki/Saint_Tropez" title="Saint Tropez" class="mw-redirect">Saint Tropez</a>, where finally he boarded a train to <a href="/wiki/Genoa" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> and traveled to <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a>. From Florence he left for <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>, a trip that in some ways changed the course of his life.</p>

<p>Upon arriving in <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> in February 1933 Merton had a severe toothache; a <a href="/wiki/Dentist" title="Dentist" class="mw-redirect">dentist</a> extracted a tooth the next day. He spent the remainder of that day recuperating in his hotel room. By the following morning he felt much better, and moved to a small <a href="/wiki/Pensione" title="Pensione" class="mw-redirect">pensione</a> with views of the <a href="/wiki/Palazzo_Barberini" title="Palazzo Barberini">Palazzo Barberini</a> and <a href="/wiki/San_Carlo_alle_Quattro_Fontane" title="San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane">San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane</a>, two magnificent pieces of architecture rich with history. In <i><a href="/wiki/The_Seven_Storey_Mountain" title="The Seven Storey Mountain">The Seven Storey Mountain</a></i>, his <a href="/wiki/Autobiography" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a>, Merton remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had been in Rome before, on an Easter vacation from school, for about a week.

But I had not really seen Rome. This time, I started out again, with the misconception common to Anglo-Saxons, that the real Rome is the Rome of the ugly ruins, the hills and the slums of the city.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Merton began going to the churches, not quite knowing why he felt so drawn to them. He did not attend Mass, he was just observing and appreciating them. It began at The Forum, at the foot of <a href="/wiki/Palatine_Hill" title="Palatine Hill">Palatine Hill</a>, where Merton happened upon one of the churches nearby. In the <a href="/wiki/Apse" title="Apse">apse</a> of the church, he set his eyes upon a mosaic of Jesus Christ that transfixed him. Merton had a hard time leaving the place, though he was unsure why. Merton officially had found the Rome he said he didn't see on his first visit: <a href="/wiki/Byzantine" title="Byzantine" class="mw-redirect">Byzantine</a> Christian Rome.</p>
<p>From this point on in his trip he set about visiting the various churches and basilica sites in Rome, such as <a href="/wiki/Lateran_Baptistery" title="Lateran Baptistery">Lateran Baptistery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Santa_Costanza" title="Santa Costanza">Santa Costanza</a>, <a href="/wiki/Basilica_di_San_Clemente" title="Basilica di San Clemente">Basilica di San Clemente</a>, <a href="/wiki/Santa_Prassede" title="Santa Prassede">Santa Prassede</a> and <a href="/wiki/Santa_Pudenziana" title="Santa Pudenziana">Santa Pudenziana</a> (to name a few). He purchased a <a href="/wiki/Vulgate" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> (<i>Latin Bible</i>), reading the entire <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. One night in his <i>pensione</i>, Merton had the sense that Owen was in the room with him for a few moments. This mystical experience led him to see the emptiness he felt in his life, and he said for the first time in his life he <i>really</i> prayed, asking God to deliver him from his darkness. <i><a href="/wiki/The_Seven_Storey_Mountain" title="The Seven Storey Mountain">The Seven Storey Mountain</a></i> also describes a visit to <a href="/wiki/Tre_Fontane" title="Tre Fontane" class="mw-redirect">Tre Fontane</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Trappist" title="Trappist" class="mw-redirect">Trappist</a> monastery in Rome. While visiting the church there he was at ease, yet when entering the monastery he was overtaken with anxiety. That afternoon, while alone, he remarked to himself: "I should like to become a Trappist monk."<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Merton took a boat from Italy to America to visit his grandparents in Douglaston for the summer, before entering Clare College in Cambridge. Initially he retained some of the spirit he had in Rome, continuing to read his Latin Bible. He wanted to find a church to attend, but still had not quite quelled his antipathy towards Catholicism. So he went to Zion <a href="/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America" class="mw-redirect">Episcopal</a> Church in Douglaston. He didn't come to appreciate his experience there, so he went to <a href="/wiki/Flushing,_New_York" title="Flushing, New York" class="mw-redirect">Flushing, New York</a>, and attended a <a href="/wiki/Quaker" title="Quaker" class="mw-redirect">Quaker</a> Meeting. Merton appreciated the silence of the atmosphere but couldn't feel at home with the group.</p>
<p>Quickly he melded in with life in New York City and became swept up in her ways. By mid-summer, Merton had lost nearly all interest in organized religion that he had found in Rome. At the end of the summer he was off for England again, this time to attend <a href="/wiki/Clare_College" title="Clare College" class="mw-redirect">Clare College</a>.</p>

<p>In October 1933 Merton entered <a href="/wiki/Clare_College" title="Clare College" class="mw-redirect">Clare College</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cambridge" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> as an undergraduate. Merton, now 18, seems to have viewed Clare College as the end-all answer to his life without meaning. In <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>, the brief chapter on Cambridge paints a fairly dark, negative picture of his life there but is short on detail.</p>
<p>Some schoolmates of Merton at Oakham, then attending Cambridge with him, remember that Tom drifted away and became isolated at Cambridge. He started drinking excessively, hanging out at the local bars more than he would study. He was also very free with his sexuality at this time, some friends going so far as to call him a womanizer. He also spent freely - far too freely in Bennett's opinion - and he was summoned for the first of what was to be a series of stern lectures in his guardian's London consulting rooms. Although details are sketchy - they appear to have been excised from a franker first draft of the autobiography by the Trappist censors - most of Merton's biographers agree that he fathered a child with one of the women he encountered at Cambridge and there was some kind of legal action pending that was settled discreetly by Bennett.</p>
<p>By this time Bennett had had enough and, in a meeting in April, Tom and his guardian appear to have struck a deal: Tom would return to the States and Bennett would not tell Merton's grandparents about his indiscretions. In May Merton left Cambridge after completing his exams.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Merton&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Columbia University">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Columbia University</span></h3>
<p>In January 1935 Merton enrolled as a sophomore at <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> while living with the Jenkins family in Douglaston and taking a train to the Columbia campus each day. Merton's years at Columbia matured him, and it is here that he discovered Catholicism in a real sense. These years were also a time in his life where he realized others were more accepting of him as an individual. In short, at 21 he was a man and an equal among his peers. At that time he established a close and long-lasting friendship with the proto-<a href="/wiki/Minimalist" title="Minimalist" class="mw-redirect">minimalist</a> painter <a href="/wiki/Ad_Reinhardt" title="Ad Reinhardt">Ad Reinhardt</a>.</p>
<p>Tom began an 18th Century English literature course during the spring semester taught by <a href="/wiki/Mark_Van_Doren" title="Mark Van Doren">Mark Van Doren</a>, a professor with whom he maintained a friendship until death. Van Doren didn't <i>teach</i> his students, at least not in any traditional sense; he <i>engaged</i> them, sharing his love of literature with all. Merton was also interested in <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a> at Columbia, where he briefly joined the <a href="/wiki/Young_Communist_League" title="Young Communist League">Young Communist League</a>; however, the first meeting he attended failed to interest him further and he never went back.</p>
<p>During summer break John Paul returned home from <a href="/wiki/Gettysburg_College" title="Gettysburg College">Gettysburg Academy</a> in <a href="/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. The two brothers spent time bonding with one another for their summer breaks, claiming later to have seen every movie produced between 1934 and 1937. When the fall semester arrived, John Paul left to enroll at <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> while Tom returned to Columbia. He began working for two school papers, a humor magazine called the <a href="/wiki/Jester_of_Columbia" title="Jester of Columbia">Jester</a> and the <i>Columbia Review</i>. Also on the Jester's staff were the poet <a href="/wiki/Robert_Lax" title="Robert Lax">Robert Lax</a> and the journalist <a href="/wiki/Ed_Rice" title="Ed Rice">Ed Rice</a>. Lax and Merton became best friends and kept up a lively correspondence until Merton's death; Rice later founded the Catholic magazine Jubilee, to which Merton frequently contributed essays. Merton also became a member of <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Delta_Phi" title="Alpha Delta Phi">Alpha Delta Phi</a> that semester and joined the <a href="/wiki/Philolexian_Society" title="Philolexian Society">Philolexian Society</a>, the campus literary and debate group.</p>
<p>In October 1935, in protest of <a href="/wiki/Second_Italo-Abyssinian_War" title="Second Italo-Abyssinian War">Italy's invasion of Ethiopia</a>, Merton joined a picket of the Casa Italiana. The Casa Italiana was conceived of by Columbia and the Italian government as a "university within a university", established in 1926. Merton also joined the local peace movement, having taken "the Oxford Pledge" to not support any government in any war they might undertake.</p>
<p>In 1936 Merton's grandfather, Samuel Jenkins, died. Merton and his grandfather had grown rather close through the years, and Merton immediately left school for home upon receiving the news. He states that, without thinking, he went to the room where his grandfather's body was and knelt down to pray over him.</p>
<p>In February 1937, Merton read a book that opened his mind to Catholicism. It was titled <i>The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy</i> by <a href="/wiki/Etienne_Gilson" title="Etienne Gilson" class="mw-redirect">Etienne Gilson</a>, and inside he encountered an explanation of God that he found both logical and pragmatic. Tom purchased this book because he was taking a class on <a href="/wiki/Medieval_French_literature" title="Medieval French literature">medieval French literature</a>, not seeing the <i><a href="/wiki/Nihil_obstat" title="Nihil obstat">nihil obstat</a></i> in the book denoting its Catholic origin. This work was pivotal, paving the way for more encounters with Catholicism. Another author Merton began reading at this time was <a href="/wiki/Aldous_Huxley" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>, whose book <i>Ends and Means</i> introduced Merton to <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a>. In August of the same year, Tom's grandmother, Bonnemaman, died.</p>
<p>In January 1938 Merton graduated from Columbia with a <a href="/wiki/B.A." title="B.A." class="mw-redirect">B.A.</a> in English. After graduation he continued at Columbia, doing graduate work in English. In June, a friend, Seymour Freedgood, arranged a meeting with Mahanambrata Brahmachari, a <a href="/wiki/Hindu" title="Hindu" class="mw-redirect">Hindu</a> monk in New York visiting from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. Merton was very impressed by the man, seeing that he was profoundly centered in God. Merton, curious, expected Brahmachari to espouse his beliefs and religion to them in some manner. Instead, Brahmachari recommended that they reconnect with their own spiritual roots and traditions. He suggested Merton read <i>The <a href="/wiki/Confessions_(St._Augustine)" title="Confessions (St. Augustine)">Confessions</a></i> of <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine</a> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Imitation_of_Christ" title="The Imitation of Christ" class="mw-redirect">The Imitation of Christ</a></i>. Although Merton was surprised to hear the monk recommending Catholic books, he read them both. He also started to pray again regularly.</p>
<p>For the next few months Merton began to consider Catholicism as something to explore again. Finally, in August 1938, he decided he wanted to attend Mass and went to <a href="/wiki/Corpus_Christi_Church_(New_York)" title="Corpus Christi Church (New York)">Corpus Christi Church (New York)</a> located near to the Columbia campus. Mass was foreign to him, but he listened attentively. Following this experience Merton's reading list became more and more geared toward <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholicism</a>. While doing his graduate work, he was writing his thesis on <a href="/wiki/William_Blake" title="William Blake">William Blake</a>, whose spiritual symbolism he was coming to appreciate in new ways.</p>
<p>One evening in September, Merton was reading a book about <a href="/wiki/Gerard_Manley_Hopkins" title="Gerard Manley Hopkins">Gerard Manley Hopkins</a>' conversion to Catholicism and how he became a priest. Suddenly he could not shake this sense that he, too, should follow such a path. He grabbed his coat and headed quickly over to the Corpus Christi Church rectory, where he met with a Fr. George Barry Ford, expressing his desire to become Catholic. The next few weeks Merton started <a href="/wiki/Catechism" title="Catechism">catechism</a>, learning the basics of his new faith. On November 16, 1938, Thomas Merton was baptized at <a href="http://www.corpus-christi-nyc.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.corpus-christi-nyc.org/" rel="nofollow">Corpus Christi Church</a> on West 121st St., <a href="/wiki/Morningside_Heights" title="Morningside Heights" class="mw-redirect">Morningside Heights</a> and received <a href="/wiki/Holy_Communion" title="Holy Communion" class="mw-redirect">Holy Communion</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> On February 22, 1939, Merton received his <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(postgraduate)" title="Master of Arts (postgraduate)">M.A.</a> in English from Columbia University. Merton decided he would pursue his <a href="/wiki/Ph.D." title="Ph.D." class="mw-redirect">Ph.D.</a> at Columbia and moved from Douglaston to <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a>.</p>
<p>In January 1939 Merton had heard good things from friends of his about a part-time teacher on campus named Daniel Walsh, so he decided to take a course on <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> with Walsh. Through Walsh, Merton was introduced to <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Maritain" title="Jacques Maritain">Jacques Maritain</a> at a lecture on <a href="/wiki/Catholic_Action" title="Catholic Action">Catholic Action</a>, which took place at a Catholic Book Club meeting the following March. Merton and Walsh developed a lifelong friendship, and it was Walsh who convinced Merton that <a href="/wiki/Thomism" title="Thomism">Thomism</a> was not for him. On May 25, 1939, Merton received <a href="/wiki/Confirmation" title="Confirmation">Confirmation</a> at Corpus Christi, and took the confirmation name <i>James</i>.</p>

<p>In October 1939, Merton invited friends back to sleep over at his place following a long night out at a <a href="/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a> club. Over breakfast, Merton told them of his desire to become a priest. Soon after this epiphany, Merton visited Fr. Ford at Corpus Christi to share his feeling. Ford agreed with Merton, but added that he felt Merton was suited for the diocesan priesthood and advised against joining an order.</p>
<p>Soon after, Merton met with his teacher Dan Walsh, whom he trusted to advise him on the matter. Walsh disagreed with Ford's assessment that Merton was suited to a secular calling. Instead, he felt Merton was spiritually and intellectually more suited for a priestly vocation in a specific order. So they discussed the <a href="/wiki/Jesuits" title="Jesuits" class="mw-redirect">Jesuits</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cistercians" title="Cistercians">Cistercians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Franciscans" title="Franciscans" class="mw-redirect">Franciscans</a>. Since Merton had appreciated what he had read of <a href="/wiki/Saint_Francis_of_Assisi" title="Saint Francis of Assisi" class="mw-redirect">Saint Francis of Assisi</a>, he felt that might be the direction he was being called to.</p>
<p>Walsh set up a meeting with a Fr. Edmund Murphy, a friend at the monastery of St. Francis of Assisi on 31st street. The interview went well and Merton was given an application, as well as Fr. Murphy's personal invitation to become a Franciscan <a href="/wiki/Friar" title="Friar">friar</a>. However, he noted that Merton would not be able to enter the <a href="/wiki/Novitiate" title="Novitiate">novitiate</a> until August 1940 because that was the only month in which they accepted new postulants. Merton was very excited, yet disappointed that it would be another year before he would fulfill his calling.</p>
<p>By 1940 Merton began to have doubts about whether he was fit to be a Franciscan. He felt he had never truly been upfront about his past with Fr. Murphy or Dan Walsh. It is possible some of this may have concerned his time at Cambridge, though he is never specific in <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> about precisely what he felt he was hiding. Merton arranged to see Fr. Murphy and tell him of his past troubles. Fr. Murphy was understanding during the meeting, but told Tom he ought to return the next day once he had time to consider this new information. That next day Fr. Murphy delivered Merton devastating news. He no longer felt Merton was suitable material for a Franciscan vocation as a friar, and even said that the August novitiate was now full. Fr. Murphy seemed uninterested in helping Merton's cause any further, and Merton believed at once that his calling was finished.</p>

<p>In early August 1940, the month he would have entered the Franciscan novitiate, Merton went to <a href="/wiki/Olean,_New_York" title="Olean, New York">Olean, New York</a>, to stay with friends, including Robert Lax and Ed Rice, at a cottage where they had vacationed the summer before. This was a tough time for Merton, and he wanted to be in the company of friends. Merton now needed a job. Nearby the cottage was <a href="/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University" title="St. Bonaventure University">St. Bonaventure University</a>, a Franciscan university he had learned about through Fr. Edmund. The day after arriving in Olean, Merton went to St. Bonaventure for an interview with then president Fr. Thomas Plassman. As providence would have it there was an opening for Merton in the English department and he was hired on the spot. Merton chose St. Bonaventure because he still harbored a desire to be a friar, and felt that he could at least live among them if not be one of them.</p>
<p>In September 1940, Merton moved into a <a href="/wiki/Dormitory" title="Dormitory">dormitory</a> on campus. (His old room in Devereux Hall has a sign above the door to this effect) While Merton's stay at Bonaventure would prove brief, the time was pivotal for him. While teaching there, Merton's spiritual life blossomed as he went deeper and deeper into his prayer life. He all but gave up drinking, quit smoking, stopped going to movies and became more selective in his reading materials. In his own way he was undergoing a kind of lay renunciation of worldly pleasures. In April 1941, Merton went to a retreat he had booked for <a href="/wiki/Holy_Week" title="Holy Week">Holy Week</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Abbey_of_Gethsemani" title="Abbey of Gethsemani" class="mw-redirect">Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani</a> near <a href="/wiki/Bardstown,_Kentucky" title="Bardstown, Kentucky">Bardstown, Kentucky</a>. At once Merton felt a pull to the place, and could feel his spirits rise during his stay.</p>
<p>Returning to St. Bonaventure with Gethsemani on his mind, Merton returned to teaching. In May 1941 he had an occasion where he used his old <a href="/wiki/Vulgate" title="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, purchased in Italy back in 1933, as a kind of oracle. The idea was that he would randomly select a page and blindly point his finger somewhere, seeing if it would render him some sort of sign. On his second try Merton laid his finger on a section of <a href="/wiki/The_Gospel_of_Luke" title="The Gospel of Luke" class="mw-redirect">The Gospel of Luke</a> which stated, "Behold, thou shalt be silent". Immediately Merton thought of the <a href="/wiki/Cistercians" title="Cistercians">Cistercians</a>. Although he was still unsure of his qualifications for a religious vocation, Merton felt he was being drawn more and more to a specific calling.</p>
<p>In August 1941 Merton attended a talk at the school given by <a href="/wiki/Catherine_de_Hueck" title="Catherine de Hueck" class="mw-redirect">Catherine de Hueck</a>. Hueck had founded the <a href="/wiki/Friendship_House" title="Friendship House">Friendship House</a> in <a href="/wiki/Toronto" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> and its sister house in <a href="/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a>. Merton appreciated the mission of Hueck and Friendship House, which was racial harmony and charity, and decided to volunteer there for two weeks. Merton was amazed at how little he had learned of New York during his studies at Columbia. Harlem was such a different place, full of poverty and prostitution. Merton felt especially troubled by the situation of children being raised in the environment there. Friendship House had a profound impact on Merton, and he would speak of it often in his later writing.</p>
<p>In November 1941 Hueck asked if Merton would consider becoming a full time member of Friendship House, to which Merton responded cordially yet noncommittally. He still felt unfit to serve Christ, and even hinted at such in a letter to Hueck that same month in which he implies he is not good enough for her organization. Merton soon let Hueck know in early December that he would definitely not be joining Friendship House, explaining his persistent attraction to the priesthood.</p>

<p>On December 10, 1941 Thomas Merton arrived at the <a href="/wiki/Abbey_of_Gethsemani" title="Abbey of Gethsemani" class="mw-redirect">Abbey of Gethsemani</a> and spent three days at the monastery guest house, waiting for acceptance into the Order. The novice master would come to interview Merton, gauging his sincerity and qualifications. In the interim, Merton was put to work polishing floors and scrubbing dishes. On December 13 he was accepted into the monastery as a postulant by Dom Frederic Dunne, Gethsemani's Father Abbot since 1935. Merton's first few days did not go smoothly. He had a severe cold from his stay in the guest house, where he sat in front of an open window to prove his sincerity. But Merton devoted himself entirely to adjusting to the austerity, enjoying the change of lifestyle. During his initial weeks at Gethsemani, Merton studied the complicated <a href="/wiki/Monastic_sign_language" title="Monastic sign language">Cistercian sign language</a> and daily work and worship routine.</p>
<p>In March 1942, during the first Sunday of <a href="/wiki/Lent" title="Lent">Lent</a>, Merton was accepted as a novice monk at the monastery. In June, Merton received a letter from his brother John Paul stating he was soon to leave for war, that he would be coming to Gethsemani to visit Merton before leaving. On July 17 John Paul arrived in Gethsemani and the two brothers did some catching up. John Paul expressed his desire to become Catholic, and by July 26 was baptized at a church in nearby <a href="/wiki/New_Haven,_KY" title="New Haven, KY" class="mw-redirect">New Haven, KY</a>, leaving the following day. This would be the last time the two would see each other. John Paul died on April 17, 1943 while flying over the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> when his plane's engines failed. A poem by Merton to John Paul appears at the end of <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>.</p>

<p>Merton kept journals throughout his stay at Gethsemani. Initially he had felt writing to be at odds with his vocation, worried it would foster a tendency to individuality. Fortunately his superior, Father Abbot Dom Frederic, saw that Merton had a gifted intellect and talent for writing. In 1943 Merton was tasked to translate religious texts and write biographies on the saints for the monastery. Merton approached his new writing assignment with the same fervor and zeal he displayed in the farmyard.</p>
<p>On March 19, 1944 Merton made his temporary profession <a href="/wiki/Vows" title="Vows" class="mw-redirect">vows</a> and was given the white <a href="/wiki/Cowl" title="Cowl">cowl</a>, black <a href="/wiki/Scapular" title="Scapular">scapular</a> and leather belt. In November 1944 a manuscript Merton had given to friend <a href="/wiki/Robert_Lax" title="Robert Lax">Robert Lax</a> the previous year was published by <a href="/wiki/James_Laughlin" title="James Laughlin">James Laughlin</a> at <a href="/wiki/New_Directions" title="New Directions" class="mw-redirect">New Directions</a>, a book of <a href="/wiki/Poetry" title="Poetry">poetry</a> titled <i>Thirty Poems</i>. Merton had mixed feelings about the publishing of this work, but Dom Frederic remained resolute over Merton continuing his writing. New Directions published another poetry collection in 1946 for Merton <i>A Man in the Divided Sea</i>, which combined with <i>Thirty Poems</i> attracted some recognition for him. The same year Merton's manuscript for <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> was accepted by <a href="/wiki/Harcourt_Trade_Publishers" title="Harcourt Trade Publishers">Harcourt Brace &amp; Company</a> for publication. <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>, Merton’s <a href="/wiki/Autobiography" title="Autobiography">autobiography</a>, was written during two-hour intervals in the monastery <a href="/wiki/Scriptorium" title="Scriptorium">scriptorium</a> as a personal project.</p>
<p>By 1947 Merton was more comfortable in his role as a writer. On March 19 Merton took his solemn vows, a commitment to live out his life at the monastery. He also began corresponding with a <a href="/wiki/Carthusian" title="Carthusian">Carthusian</a> at St. Hugh's Charterhouse in Parkminster, <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>. Merton harbored an appreciation for the Carthusian order since coming to Gethsemani in 1941, and would later come to consider leaving the Cistercians for the Order. On July 4 the <a href="/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> journal <i><a href="/wiki/Commonweal" title="Commonweal">Commonweal</a></i> published an essay by Merton titled <i>Poetry and the Contemplative Life</i>.</p>
<p>In 1948 <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> was published to critical acclaim, with fan mail to Merton reaching new heights. Merton also published several works for the monastery that year, which were: <i>Guide to Cistercian Life</i>, <i>Cistercian Contemplatives</i>, <i>Figures for an Apocalypse</i>, and <i>The Spirit of Simplicity</i>. <a href="/wiki/Saint_Mary%27s_College_(Indiana)" title="Saint Mary's College (Indiana)">Saint Mary's College (Indiana)</a> published a booklet by Merton that year also, <i>What Is Contemplation?</i>. Merton also published a wonderful biography that year <i>Exile Ends in Glory: The Life of a Trappistine, Mother M. Berchmans, O.C.S.O</i>. Merton’s Father Abbot, Dom Frederic Dunne, died on August 3, 1948 on a trainride to <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>. Dunne’s passing was painful for Merton, who came to look at the Abbot as a father figure and spiritual mentor. Dunne was replaced by Dom James Fox on August 15, a former <a href="/wiki/U.S._Navy" title="U.S. Navy" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Navy</a> officer. In October Merton discussed with the new Abbot his ongoing attraction to the Carthusian Order, to which Fox responded by assuring Merton that he belonged at Gethsemani. Fox permitted Merton to continue his writing, Merton now having gained substantial recognition outside the monastery. On December 21 Merton was ordained as a <a href="/wiki/Subdeacon" title="Subdeacon">subdeacon</a>.</p>
<p>On January 5, 1949 Merton took a train to <a href="/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville</a> and applied for U.S. citizenship. Published that year were <i>Seeds of Contemplation</i>, <i>The Tears of Blind Lions</i>, <i>The Waters of Siloe</i>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> edition of <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> under the title <i>Elected Silence</i>. On March 19 Merton became a deacon in the Order, and on May 26 (<a href="/wiki/Ascension_Thursday" title="Ascension Thursday" class="mw-redirect">Ascension Thursday</a>) Merton was ordained as a priest, saying his first Mass the following day. In June the monastery celebrated its <a href="/wiki/Centenary" title="Centenary" class="mw-redirect">centenary</a>, for which Merton authored the book <i>Gethsemani Magnificat</i> in commemoration. By November Merton started teaching novices at Gethsemani in <a href="/wiki/Mystical_theology" title="Mystical theology">mystical theology</a>, a duty he greatly enjoyed. Through subsequent years Merton would author many other books and amassed himself a wide readership. He would come to revise <i>Seeds of Contemplation</i> several times, viewing his early edition as error prone and immature. One's place in society, views on social activism, and various approaches toward contemplative prayer and living became constant themes in his writings.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, he had arrived at a broadly human viewpoint, one deeply concerned about the world and issues like peace, racial tolerance, and social equality. He had developed a personal radicalism which had political implications but was not based on ideology, rooted above all in non-violence. He regarded his viewpoint as based on "simplicity" and expressed it as a Christian sensibility. In a letter to a Latin-American Catholic writer, <a href="/wiki/Ernesto_Cardenal" title="Ernesto Cardenal">Ernesto Cardenal</a>, Merton wrote: "The world is full of great criminals with enormous power, and they are in a death struggle with each other. It is a huge gang battle, using well-meaning lawyers and policemen and clergymen as their front, controlling papers, means of communication, and enrolling everybody in their armies."<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On May 26, 1949 (on <a href="/wiki/Ascension_Thursday" title="Ascension Thursday" class="mw-redirect">Ascension Thursday</a>) Thomas Merton was ordained as a priest, saying his first Mass that following day in honor of Our Lady of Cobre. In November, Merton began teaching the novices in <a href="/wiki/Mystical_theology" title="Mystical theology">mystical theology</a>. By this time Merton was a huge success outside the monastery, <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i> having sold over 150,000 copies. As a humorous side note, in December a fellow priest at the monastery allowed Merton to take the monastery jeep out on the property for a drive. Merton, having never learned to drive, wound up hitting some trees and running through ditches, flipping it halfway over in the middle of the road. Needless to say, he never used the jeep again.</p>
<p>During his long years at Gethsemani Merton changed from the passionately inward-looking young monk of <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>, to a more contemplative writer and poet. Merton became well known for his dialogues with other faiths and his non-violent stand during the <a href="/wiki/Race_riot" title="Race riot">race riots</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> of the 1960s. Merton finally achieved the solitude he had long desired while living in a <a href="/wiki/Hermitage_(religious_retreat)" title="Hermitage (religious retreat)">hermitage</a> on the monastery grounds in 1965. Over the years he had some battles with some of his <a href="/wiki/Abbot" title="Abbot">abbots</a> about not being allowed out of the monastery, balanced by his international reputation and voluminous correspondence with many well-known figures of the day.</p>
<p>Rev. Flavian Burns, the new abbot, allowed him the freedom to undertake a tour of Asia at the end of 1968, during which he met the <a href="/wiki/Tenzin_Gyatso" title="Tenzin Gyatso" class="mw-redirect">Dalai Lama</a> in <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>. He also made a visit to <a href="/wiki/Polonnaruwa" title="Polonnaruwa">Polonnaruwa</a> (in what was then <a href="/wiki/Ceylon" title="Ceylon" class="mw-redirect">Ceylon</a>), where he had a religious experience while viewing enormous statues of the <a href="/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" title="Gautama Buddha">Buddha</a>. There is speculation that Merton wished to remain in Asia as a hermit. It is also said<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution.&#160;since February 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">who?</a></i>]</span></sup> that Merton had planned to visit <a href="/wiki/Cid_Corman" title="Cid Corman">Cid Corman</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kyoto" title="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> but never achieved that goal.</p>

<p>According to <i>The Seven Storey Mountain</i>, the youthful Merton loved <a href="/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, but by the time he began his first teaching job, he had forsaken all but peaceful music. Later in life, whenever he was permitted to leave Gethsemani for medical or monastic reasons, he would catch what live jazz he could, mainly in Louisville or New York.</p>
<p>In April 1966, Merton underwent a surgical procedure to treat debilitating back pain. While recuperating in a Louisville hospital, he fell in love with a student nurse assigned to his care. He wrote poems to her and reflected on the relationship in "A Midsummer Diary for M." Merton struggled to maintain his vows against being deeply in love with the woman he referred to in his personal diary as, "M." He did remain <a href="/wiki/Celibate" title="Celibate" class="mw-redirect">celibate</a>, never consummating the relationship. After ending the relationship, he recommitted himself to his vows.<sup id="cite_ref-LearningLove_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LearningLove-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Merton's influence has grown since his death and he is widely recognized as an important 20th-century Catholic <a href="/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mystic</a> and thinker. Interest in his work contributed to a rise in spiritual exploration beginning in the 1960s and 1970s in the US. Merton's letters and diaries, reveal the intensity with which their author focused on social justice issues, including the civil rights movement and proliferation of nuclear arms. He had prohibited their publication for 25 years after his death. Publication raised new interest in Merton's life.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Abbey_of_Gethsemani" title="Abbey of Gethsemani" class="mw-redirect">Abbey of Gethsemani</a> benefited from the royalties of Merton's writing.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. In addition, his writings attracted much interest in Catholic practice and thought, and in the Cistercian vocation.</p>
<p>In recognition of Merton's close association with <a href="/wiki/Bellarmine_University" title="Bellarmine University">Bellarmine University</a>, the university established an official repository for Merton's archives at the <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Merton_Center" title="Thomas Merton Center">Thomas Merton Center</a> on the Bellarmine campus in <a href="/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>.</p>

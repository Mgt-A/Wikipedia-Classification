<p><b>Medieval <a href="/wiki/Cuisine" title="Cuisine">cuisine</a></b> includes the <a href="/wiki/Food" title="Food">foods</a>, eating habits, and <a href="/wiki/Cooking" title="Cooking">cooking</a> methods of various <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_Europe" title="Culture of Europe">European cultures</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Middle_Ages" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, a period roughly dating from the 5th to the 16th century. During this period, <a href="/wiki/Diet_(nutrition)" title="Diet (nutrition)">diets</a> and cooking changed across <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and these changes helped lay the foundations for modern <a href="/wiki/European_cuisine" title="European cuisine">European cuisine</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Cereal" title="Cereal">Cereals</a> became the most important staples during the <a href="/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages" title="Early Middle Ages">early Middle Ages</a>. They were eaten as <a href="/wiki/Bread" title="Bread">bread</a>, <a href="/wiki/Porridge" title="Porridge">porridge</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gruel" title="Gruel">gruel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pasta" title="Pasta">pasta</a> by virtually all members of society. <a href="/wiki/Vegetable" title="Vegetable">Vegetables</a> were important supplements to the cereal-based diet. <a href="/wiki/Meat" title="Meat">Meat</a> was more expensive and therefore more prestigious and was more common on the tables of the nobility. The most popular types of meat were <a href="/wiki/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chicken_(food)" title="Chicken (food)">chicken</a>, while <a href="/wiki/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a>, which required greater investment in land, was less common. <a href="/wiki/Cod" title="Cod">Cod</a> and <a href="/wiki/Herring" title="Herring">herring</a> were mainstays among the northern population, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater <a href="/wiki/Fish_(food)" title="Fish (food)" class="mw-redirect">fish</a> were also eaten.</p>
<p>Slow transportation and inefficient <a href="/wiki/Food_preservation" title="Food preservation">food preservation</a> techniques made long-distance <a href="/wiki/Trade" title="Trade">trade</a> of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the food of the nobility was more prone to foreign influence than the cuisine of poorer people. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes, and <a href="/wiki/Sumptuary_law" title="Sumptuary law">sumptuary laws</a> limited the <a href="/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption" title="Conspicuous consumption">conspicuous consumption</a> among the <a href="/wiki/Nouveau_riche" title="Nouveau riche">nouveau riche</a>. <a href="/wiki/Norm_(sociology)" title="Norm (sociology)">Social norms</a> also dictated that the food of the <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labor and one's food, so manual labor required coarser, cheaper food.</p>
<p>A form of <i><a href="/wiki/Haute_cuisine" title="Haute cuisine">haute cuisine</a></i> developed during the <a href="/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">late Middle Ages</a> that set the standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common <a href="/wiki/Seasoning" title="Seasoning">seasonings</a> included <a href="/wiki/Verjuice" title="Verjuice">verjuice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> in combination with spices such as <a href="/wiki/Black_pepper" title="Black pepper">black pepper</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saffron" title="Saffron">saffron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ginger" title="Ginger">ginger</a>. These, along with the widespread use of <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a> or <a href="/wiki/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> gave many dishes a <a href="/wiki/Sweet_and_sour" title="Sweet and sour" class="mw-redirect">sweet-sour</a> flavor. <a href="/wiki/Almond" title="Almond">Almonds</a> were very popular as a <a href="/wiki/Thickening_agent" title="Thickening agent">thickener</a> in <a href="/wiki/Soup" title="Soup">soups</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stew" title="Stew">stews</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Sauce" title="Sauce">sauces</a>, particularly as <a href="/wiki/Almond_milk" title="Almond milk">almond milk</a>.</p>

<p>The cuisines of the cultures of the <a href="/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin" title="Mediterranean Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a> had since antiquity been based on cereals, particularly various types of <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">wheat</a>. Porridge and gruel, and later bread became the basic food staple that made up the majority of calorie intake for most of the population. From the 8th to the 11th centuries, the proportion of various cereals of the diet rose from about <span style="white-space:nowrap" class="template-frac"><sup>1</sup><big>⁄</big><sub>3</sub></span> to <span style="white-space:nowrap" class="template-frac"><sup>3</sup><big>⁄</big><sub>4</sub></span>.<sup id="cite_ref-HM_16_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM_16-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The dependence on wheat remained significant throughout the medieval era, and with the rise of Christianity spread northwards. In colder climates, however, it was usually unaffordable for the majority population, and was associated with the higher classes. The centrality of bread in religious rituals such as the <a href="/wiki/Eucharist" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> meant that it enjoyed an especially high prestige among foodstuffs. Only (olive) oil and wine had a comparable value, but both remained quite exclusive outside of the warmer wine- and olive-growing regions. The role of bread as symbolic of both sustenance and substance is illustrated in a sermon given by Saint <a href="/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine</a>:</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Churches</a> and their calendars had great influence on eating habits; consumption of meat was forbidden for a full third of the year for most <a href="/wiki/History_of_Christianity#Church_of_the_High_Middle_Ages_.28800_.E2.80.93_1499.29" title="History of Christianity">Christians</a>, and all animal products, including <a href="/wiki/Egg_(food)" title="Egg (food)">eggs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dairy_product" title="Dairy product">dairy products</a> (but not fish), were generally prohibited during <a href="/wiki/Lent" title="Lent">Lent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fasting" title="Fasting">fast</a>. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the <a href="/wiki/Eucharist" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, and these fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence.</p>
<p>Both the Eastern and the Western churches ordained that feast should alternate with fast. In most of Europe, Wednesdays, Fridays, sometimes Saturdays and various other days on the calendar, including <a href="/wiki/Lent" title="Lent">Lent</a> and <a href="/wiki/Advent" title="Advent">Advent</a>, were fast days. Meat and animal products like milk, cheese, butter and eggs were not allowed, only fish. The fast was intended to mortify the body and invigorate the soul, to reinforce the medieval <a href="/wiki/Dogma" title="Dogma">dogma</a> that the flesh was inferior, and also to remind of <a href="/wiki/Christ" title="Christ">Christ</a>'s sacrifice for humanity. The intention was not to portray certain foods as unclean, but rather to teach a spiritual lesson in self-restraint through abstention. During particularly severe fast days, the number of daily meals was also reduced to one. Even if most people respected these restrictions and usually made <a href="/wiki/Penance" title="Penance">penance</a> when they violated them, there were also numerous ways of circumventing the problem, a conflict of ideals and practice summarized by writer Bridget Ann Henisch:</p>

<p>While animal products were to be avoided during times of penance, pragmatic compromises often prevailed. The definition of "fish" was often extended to marine and semi-aquatic animals such as <a href="/wiki/Whale" title="Whale">whales</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barnacle_goose" title="Barnacle goose" class="mw-redirect">barnacle geese</a>, puffins and even <a href="/wiki/Beaver" title="Beaver">beavers</a>. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, but that did not mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against (moderate) drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days could be splendid, and they were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat, cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways; fish could be molded to look like <a href="/wiki/Venison" title="Venison">venison</a> and fake eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with fish <a href="/wiki/Roe" title="Roe">roe</a> and almond milk and cooking it in coals. While <a href="/wiki/Byzantine_Empire" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> church officials took a hard-line approach, and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy, their Western counterparts were far more lenient.<sup id="cite_ref-henisch43_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-henisch43-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> There was also no lack of grumbling about the rigors of fasting among the laity. During Lent, kings and schoolboys, commoners and nobility, all complained about being deprived of meat for the long, hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins. At Lent, owners of livestock were even warned to keep an eye out for hungry dogs frustrated by a "hard siege by Lent and fish bones".<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The trend from the 13th century onward was toward a more legalistic interpretation of fasting. Nobles were careful not to eat meat on fast days, but still dined in style; fish replaced meat, often as imitation hams and bacon; almond milk replaced animal milk as an expensive non-dairy alternative; faux eggs made from almond milk were cooked in blown-out eggshells, flavored and colored with exclusive spices. In some cases the lavishness of noble tables were outdone by <a href="/wiki/Benedictine" title="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monasteries, which served as much as sixteen courses during certain feast days. Exceptions from fasting were frequently made for very broadly defined groups. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> (c. 1225–1274) believed dispensation should be provided for children, the old, <a href="/wiki/Pilgrim" title="Pilgrim">pilgrims</a>, workers and beggars, but not the poor as long as they had some sort of shelter.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> There are many accounts of members of <a href="/wiki/Christian_monasticism" title="Christian monasticism">monastic orders</a> who flouted fasting restrictions through clever interpretations of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>. Since the sick were exempt from fasting, there often evolved the notion that fasting restrictions only applied to the main dining area, and many <a href="/wiki/Friar" title="Friar">friars</a> would simply eat their fast day meals in what would later evolve into the <a href="/wiki/Misericord" title="Misericord">misericord</a> rather than the <a href="/wiki/Refectory" title="Refectory">refectory</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Newly assigned Catholic monastery officials sought to amend the problem of fast evasion not merely with moral condemnations, but by making sure that well-prepared non-meat dishes were available on fast days.<sup id="cite_ref-henisch43_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-henisch43-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Medieval society was socially stratified and divided into classes that were strictly separated. In a time when <a href="/wiki/Famine" title="Famine">famine</a> was commonplace and <a href="/wiki/Social_hierarchy" title="Social hierarchy">social hierarchies</a> were often brutally enforced, food was an important marker of social status in a way that has no equivalent today in most <a href="/wiki/Developed_country" title="Developed country">developed countries</a>. According to the ideological norm society consisted of the three <a href="/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm" title="Estates of the realm">estates of the realm</a>: <a href="/wiki/Nobility" title="Nobility">nobility</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clergy" title="Clergy">clergy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Commoner" title="Commoner">commoners</a>, the majority part of the working class. The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners. Within the nobility and clergy there were also a multitude of ranks ranging from <a href="/wiki/King" title="King">kings</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pope" title="Pope">popes</a> to <a href="/wiki/Duke" title="Duke">dukes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bishop" title="Bishop">bishops</a> and their subordinates, such as <a href="/wiki/Squire" title="Squire">squires</a> and <a href="/wiki/Priest" title="Priest">priests</a>. In general, one was expected to remain in the social class one was born into and to respect the authority of the ruling classes. Political power was expected to be displayed not just through rule, but also by displaying wealth. Nobles were expected to dine on fresh game meat seasoned with exotic spices and display refined table manners; rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread, salt pork and beans and were not expected to be cognizant of etiquette. This notion was reinforced politically and ideologically, even through dietary recommendations. The diet of nobles and high-ranking clergymen was considered to be as much a requirement of refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality. The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic tenant farmers and rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the late Middle Ages, the increasing wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, and threatened to break down some of the symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Sumptuary_law" title="Sumptuary law">sumptuary laws</a> that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Medical science of the Middle Ages had a considerable influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious among the upper classes. One's lifestyle—including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies—was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person's health. All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from hot to cold and moist to dry, according to the <a href="/wiki/Four_humors" title="Four humors" class="mw-redirect">four bodily humors</a> theory proposed by <a href="/wiki/Galen" title="Galen">Galen</a> that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century.</p>
<p>Medieval scholars considered human <a href="/wiki/Digestion" title="Digestion">digestion</a> to be a process similar to cooking. The processing of food in the stomach was seen as a continuation of the preparation initiated by the cook. In order for the food to be properly "cooked" and for the nutrients to be properly absorbed, it was important that the <a href="/wiki/Stomach" title="Stomach">stomach</a> be filled in an appropriate manner. Easily digestible foods would be consumed first, followed by gradually heavier dishes. If this regimen was not respected it was believed that heavy foods would sink to the bottom of the stomach, thus blocking the digestion duct, so that food would digest very slowly and cause <a href="/wiki/Putrefaction" title="Putrefaction">putrefaction</a> of the body and draw bad humors into the stomach. It was also of vital importance that food of differing properties not be mixed.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Before a meal, the stomach would preferably be "opened" with an <i><a href="/wiki/Ap%C3%A9ritif" title="Apéritif">apéritif</a></i> (from <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>aperire</i>, "to open") that was preferably of a hot and dry nature: <a href="/wiki/Confection" title="Confection" class="mw-redirect">confections</a> made from <a href="/wiki/Sugar" title="Sugar">sugar</a>- or <a href="/wiki/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a>-coated spices like <a href="/wiki/Ginger" title="Ginger">ginger</a>, <a href="/wiki/Caraway" title="Caraway">caraway</a> and seeds of <a href="/wiki/Anise" title="Anise">anise</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fennel" title="Fennel">fennel</a> or <a href="/wiki/Cumin" title="Cumin">cumin</a>, wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks. As the stomach had been opened, it should then be "closed" at the end of the meal with the help of a digestive, most commonly a <a href="/wiki/Drag%C3%A9e" title="Dragée">dragée</a>, which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar, or <a href="/wiki/Hypocras" title="Hypocras">hypocras</a>, a wine flavored with fragrant spices, along with aged cheese. A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit, such as apples. It would then be followed by vegetables such as <a href="/wiki/Lettuce" title="Lettuce">lettuce</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cabbage" title="Cabbage">cabbage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portulaca_oleracea" title="Portulaca oleracea">purslane</a>, herbs, moist fruits, light meats, like chicken or <a href="/wiki/Domestic_goat#Meat" title="Domestic goat" class="mw-redirect">goat kid</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Potage" title="Potage">potages</a> and <a href="/wiki/Broth" title="Broth">broths</a>. After that came the "heavy" meats, such as <a href="/wiki/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a> and <a href="/wiki/Beef" title="Beef">beef</a>, as well as vegetables and nuts, including pears and chestnuts, both considered difficult to digest. It was popular, and recommended by medical expertise, to finish the meal with aged cheese and various digestives.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The most ideal food was that which most closely matched the humor of human beings, i.e. moderately warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained to achieve a true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine was believed to be cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ. Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Geographical variation was the result of differences in climate, political administration local customs that varied across the continent.

<p>Like just about every part of life at the time, a medieval meal was generally a communal affair. The entire household, including servants, would ideally dine together. To sneak off to enjoy private company was considered a haughty and inefficient <a href="/wiki/Egotism" title="Egotism">egotism</a> in a world where people depended very much on each other. In the 13th century, English <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Lincoln" title="Bishop of Lincoln">bishop</a> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Grosseteste" title="Robert Grosseteste">Robert Grosseteste</a> advised the <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Lincoln" title="Earl of Lincoln">Countess of Lincoln</a>: "forbid dinners and suppers out of hall, in secret and in private rooms, for from this arises waste and no honour to the lord and lady." He also recommended to watch that the servants not make off with leftovers to make merry at rere-suppers, rather than giving it as <a href="/wiki/Alms" title="Alms">alms</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-henisch17_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-henisch17-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the wealthy increasingly sought to escape this regime of stern collectivism. When possible, rich hosts retired with their consorts to private chambers where the meal could be enjoyed in greater exclusivity and privacy. Being invited to a lord's chambers was a great privilege and could be used as a way to reward friends and allies and to awe subordinates. It allowed lords to distance themselves further from the household and to enjoy more luxurious treats while serving inferior food to the rest of the household that still dined in the great hall. At major occasions and banquets, however, the host and hostess generally dined in the great hall with the other diners.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Although there are descriptions of dining etiquette on special occasions, less is known about the details of day-to-day meals of the elite or about the table manners of the common people and the destitute.

<p>Things were different for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen <a href="/wiki/Towel" title="Towel">towels</a> were offered to guests so they could wash their hands, as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes made it difficult for women to uphold the stereotype of being neat, delicate and immaculate while enjoying a sumptuous feast, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her <a href="/wiki/Lady-in-waiting" title="Lady-in-waiting">ladies-in-waiting</a>. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by <a href="/wiki/Etiquette" title="Etiquette">etiquette</a> where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion.

<p>Food was mostly served on <a href="/wiki/Plate_(dishware)" title="Plate (dishware)">plates</a> or in stew pots, and diners would take their share from the dishes and place it on <a href="/wiki/Trencher_(tableware)" title="Trencher (tableware)">trenchers</a> of stale bread, wood or <a href="/wiki/Pewter" title="Pewter">pewter</a> with the help of <a href="/wiki/Spoon" title="Spoon">spoons</a> or bare hands. In lower-class households it was common to eat food straight off the table. <a href="/wiki/Knife" title="Knife">Knives</a> were used at the table, but most people were expected to bring their own, and only highly favored guests would be given a personal knife. A knife was usually shared with at least one other dinner guest, unless one was of very high rank or well-acquainted with the host. <a href="/wiki/Fork" title="Fork">Forks</a> for eating were not in widespread usage in Europe until the <a href="/wiki/Early_modern_European_cuisine" title="Early modern European cuisine">early modern period</a>, and early on were limited to Italy.

But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making <a href="/wiki/Potage" title="Potage">potages</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stew" title="Stew">stews</a> the most common dishes.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high <a href="/wiki/Fat" title="Fat">fat</a> content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout <a href="/wiki/Asceticism" title="Asceticism">ascetics</a>, were thin.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In most households, cooking was done on an open <a href="/wiki/Hearth" title="Hearth">hearth</a> in the middle of the main living area, to make efficient use of the heat. This was the most common arrangement, even in wealthy households, for most of the Middle Ages, where the kitchen was combined with the dining hall. Towards the <a href="/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> a separate <a href="/wiki/Kitchen" title="Kitchen">kitchen</a> area began to evolve. The first step was to move the fireplaces towards the walls of the main hall, and later to build a separate building or wing that contained a dedicated kitchen area, often separated from the main building by a covered <a href="/wiki/Arcade_(architecture)" title="Arcade (architecture)">arcade</a>. This way, the smoke, odors and bustle of the kitchen could be kept out of sight of guests, and the fire risk lessened.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Many basic variations of cooking utensils available today, such as <a href="/wiki/Frying_pan" title="Frying pan">frying pans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cookware_and_bakeware" title="Cookware and bakeware">pots</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kettle" title="Kettle">kettles</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Waffle_iron" title="Waffle iron">waffle irons</a>, already existed, even if they were often too expensive for poorer households. Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were <a href="/wiki/Spit_(cooking_aide)" title="Spit (cooking aide)" class="mw-redirect">spits</a> of various sizes, and material for skewering anything from delicate <a href="/wiki/Quail" title="Quail">quails</a> to whole <a href="/wiki/Cattle#Ox" title="Cattle">oxen</a>. There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and <a href="/wiki/Cauldron" title="Cauldron">cauldrons</a> could easily be swung away from the fire to keep them from burning or boiling over. Utensils were often held directly over the fire or placed into embers on tripods. To assist the cook there were also assorted knives, stirring spoons, <a href="/wiki/Ladle_(spoon)" title="Ladle (spoon)">ladles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grater" title="Grater">graters</a>. In wealthy households one of the most common tools was the <a href="/wiki/Mortar_and_pestle" title="Mortar and pestle">mortar</a> and sieve cloth, since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped, mashed, strained and seasoned either before or after cooking. This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food, the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment. It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results. Fine-textured food was also associated with wealth; for example, finely-milled flour was expensive, while the bread of commoners was typically brown and coarse. A typical procedure was <i>farcing</i> (from the Latin <i>farcio</i>, "to cram"), to skin and <a href="/wiki/Game_(food)#Game_preparation" title="Game (food)">dress</a> an animal, grind up the meat and mix it with spices and other ingredients and then return it into its own skin, or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The kitchen staff of huge noble or royal courts occasionally numbered in the hundreds: <a href="/wiki/Panter" title="Panter">pantlers</a>, bakers, <a href="/wiki/Wafer" title="Wafer">waferers</a>, sauciers, <a href="/wiki/Larder" title="Larder">larderers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Butcher" title="Butcher">butchers</a>, carvers, page boys, milk maids, butlers and countless scullions. While an average peasant household often made do with firewood collected from the surrounding woodlands, the major kitchens of households had to cope with the logistics of daily providing at least two meals for several hundred people. Guidelines on how to prepare for a two-day banquet can be found in the 15th century cookbook <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Du_fait_de_cuisine&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Du fait de cuisine (page does not exist)">Du fait de cuisine</a></i> ("On cookery") by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Chiquart&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Chiquart (page does not exist)">Chiquart</a>, master chef of <a href="/wiki/Amadeus_VIII,_Duke_of_Savoy" title="Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy" class="mw-redirect">Amadeus VIII</a>, <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Savoy" title="Duke of Savoy" class="mw-redirect">Duke of Savoy</a>.

<p>Food preservation methods were basically the same as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of <a href="/wiki/Canning" title="Canning">canning</a> in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove <a href="/wiki/Moisture" title="Moisture">moisture</a>, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent <a href="/wiki/Microorganism" title="Microorganism">microorganisms</a> that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of <a href="/wiki/Stockfish" title="Stockfish">stockfish</a>), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food to a number of chemical processes such as <a href="/wiki/Smoking_(cooking_technique)" title="Smoking (cooking technique)" class="mw-redirect">smoking</a>, <a href="/wiki/Salting_(food)" title="Salting (food)">salting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brining" title="Brining">brining</a>, conserving or <a href="/wiki/Fermentation_(food)" title="Fermentation (food)">fermenting</a> also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in the fall was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. <a href="/wiki/Butter" title="Butter">Butter</a> tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often <a href="/wiki/Pickling" title="Pickling">pickled</a> in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, <a href="/wiki/Verjuice" title="Verjuice">verjuice</a> or <a href="/wiki/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a>). Another method was to create a seal around the food by cooking it in sugar or <a href="/wiki/Honey" title="Honey">honey</a> or fat, in which it was then stored. Bacterial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and <a href="/wiki/Grape" title="Grape">grapes</a> were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any bacteria, and milk was fermented and <a href="/wiki/Curing_(food_preservation)" title="Curing (food preservation)">cured</a> into a multitude of <a href="/wiki/Cheese" title="Cheese">cheeses</a> or <a href="/wiki/Buttermilk" title="Buttermilk">buttermilk</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The majority of the European population before <a href="/wiki/Industrialization" title="Industrialization">industrialization</a> lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with only a small percentage of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were an exception and required the surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of <a href="/wiki/Fast_food" title="Fast food">fast food</a>, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as <a href="/wiki/Pilgrim" title="Pilgrim">pilgrims</a> en route to a holy site, made use of professional <a href="/wiki/Cook_(profession)" title="Cook (profession)">cooks</a> to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Urban cookshops that catered to workers or the destitute were regarded as unsavory and disreputable places by the well-to-do and professional cooks tended to have a bad reputation. <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer" title="Geoffrey Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s Hodge of Ware, the London cook from the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, is described as a sleazy purveyor of unpalatable food, and French cardinal <a href="/wiki/Jacques_de_Vitry" title="Jacques de Vitry">Jacques de Vitry</a>'s sermons from the early 13th century describe sellers of cooked meat as an outright health hazard.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> While the necessity of the cook's services was occasionally recognized and appreciated, they were often disparaged since they catered to the baser of human needs rather than spiritual betterment. The stereotypical cook in art and literature was male, hot-tempered, prone to drunkenness, and often depicted guarding his stewpot from being pilfered by both humans and animals. In the early 15th century, the English monk <a href="/wiki/John_Lydgate" title="John Lydgate">John Lydgate</a> articulated the beliefs of many of his contemporaries by proclaiming that "Hoot ffir [fire] and smoke makith many an angry cook."<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The period between c. 500 and 1300 saw a major change in diet that affected most of Europe. More intense agriculture on an ever-increasing acreage resulted in a shift from animal products, meat and dairy products to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow. A bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. <a href="/wiki/Leaven" title="Leaven" class="mw-redirect">Leavened</a> bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread of barley, rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.<sup id="cite_ref-Kisban_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kisban-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The most common grains were <a href="/wiki/Rye" title="Rye">rye</a>, <a href="/wiki/Barley" title="Barley">barley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Buckwheat" title="Buckwheat">buckwheat</a>, <a href="/wiki/Millet" title="Millet">millet</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Oat" title="Oat">oats</a>. <a href="/wiki/Rice" title="Rice">Rice</a> remained a fairly expensive import for most of the Middle Ages and was grown in northern Italy only towards the end of the period. <a href="/wiki/Wheat" title="Wheat">Wheat</a> was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most <a href="/wiki/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutritious</a> of all grains, but was more prestigious and thus more expensive. The finely sifted white <a href="/wiki/Flour" title="Flour">flour</a> that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes. As one descended the social ladder, bread became coarser, darker, and its <a href="/wiki/Bran" title="Bran">bran</a> content increased. In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like <a href="/wiki/Chestnut" title="Chestnut">chestnuts</a>, dried <a href="/wiki/Legume" title="Legume">legumes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Acorn" title="Acorn">acorns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fern" title="Fern">ferns</a>, and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One of the most common constituents of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were <a href="/wiki/Sop" title="Sop">sops</a>, pieces of bread with which a liquid like <a href="/wiki/Wine" title="Wine">wine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Soup" title="Soup">soup</a>, <a href="/wiki/Broth" title="Broth">broth</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Sauce" title="Sauce">sauce</a> could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the <a href="/wiki/Frumenty" title="Frumenty">frumenty</a>, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as <a href="/wiki/Dessert" title="Dessert">desserts</a> or dishes for the sick, if boiled in milk (or <a href="/wiki/Almond_milk" title="Almond milk">almond milk</a>) and sweetened with sugar. <a href="/wiki/Pie" title="Pie">Pies</a> filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were <a href="/wiki/Turnover_(food)" title="Turnover (food)">turnovers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fritter" title="Fritter">fritters</a>, <a href="/wiki/Doughnut" title="Doughnut">doughnuts</a>, and many similar <a href="/wiki/Pastry" title="Pastry">pastries</a>.

<p>The importance of bread as a daily staple meant that bakers played a crucial role in any medieval community. Bread consumption was high in most of Western Europe by the 14th century. Estimates of bread consumption from different regions are fairly similar: around 1–1.5 kg (2–3 lb) of bread per person per day. Among the first town <a href="/wiki/Guild" title="Guild">guilds</a> to be organized were the bakers', and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable. The English <i><a href="/wiki/Assize_of_Bread_and_Ale" title="Assize of Bread and Ale">Assize of Bread and Ale</a></i> of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size, weight, and price of a loaf of bread was regulated in relation to grain prices. The baker's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the <a href="/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Bakers" title="Worshipful Company of Bakers">London Baker's Company</a> by adding the cost of everything from firewood and salt to the baker's wife, house, and dog. Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet, swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense. Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or adulterating <a href="/wiki/Dough" title="Dough">dough</a> with less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties. This gave rise to the "<a href="/wiki/Baker%27s_dozen" title="Baker's dozen">baker's dozen</a>": a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The lack of recipes for many basic vegetable dishes, such as <a href="/wiki/Potage" title="Potage">potages</a>, has been interpreted not to mean that they were absent from the meals of the nobility, but rather that they were considered so basic that they did not require recording.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> Carrots were available in many variants during the Middle Ages: among them a tastier reddish-purple variety and a less prestigious green-yellow type.

<p><a href="/wiki/Milk" title="Milk">Milk</a> was an important source of animal protein for those who could not afford meat.

<p><a href="/wiki/Cheese" title="Cheese">Cheese</a> was far more important as a foodstuff, especially for common people, and it has been suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. <sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch <a href="/wiki/Edam_(cheese)" title="Edam (cheese)">Edam</a>, Northern French <a href="/wiki/Brie" title="Brie">Brie</a> and Italian <a href="/wiki/Parmesan" title="Parmesan" class="mw-redirect">Parmesan</a>, were available and well-known in late medieval times.

<p>While all forms of wild <a href="/wiki/Game_(food)" title="Game (food)">game</a> were popular among those who could obtain it, most meat came from domesticated animals. <a href="/wiki/Beef" title="Beef">Beef</a> was not as common as today because raising <a href="/wiki/Cattle" title="Cattle">cattle</a> was labor-intensive, requiring pastures and feed, and oxen and cows were much more valuable as <a href="/wiki/Working_animal" title="Working animal">draught animals</a> and for producing milk.

Far more common was <a href="/wiki/Pork" title="Pork">pork</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Pig" title="Pig">pigs</a> required less attention and cheaper feed.

Intestines, bladder and stomach could be used as <a href="/wiki/Casing_(sausage)" title="Casing (sausage)">casings</a> for <a href="/wiki/Sausage" title="Sausage">sausage</a> or even illusion food such as giant eggs.

<p>Meats were more expensive than plant foods.

Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was still expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and animal products like milk and eggs. It was only after the <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages shot up.

<p>Although less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days, <a href="/wiki/Seafood" title="Seafood">seafood</a> was still the mainstay of many coastal populations.

<p>In modern times, <a href="/wiki/Water" title="Water">water</a> is seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, concerns over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and <a href="/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" title="Alcoholic beverage">alcoholic beverages</a> were always preferred.

The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily <a href="/wiki/Beer" title="Beer">beer</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ale" title="Ale">ale</a>. Because of the difficulty of preserving this beverage for any time (especially before the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Hops" title="Hops">hops</a>), it was mostly consumed fresh; it was therefore cloudier and perhaps had a lower alcohol content than the typical modern equivalent. Plain <a href="/wiki/Milk" title="Milk">milk</a> was not consumed by adults except the poor or sick, being reserved for the very young or elderly, and then usually as <a href="/wiki/Buttermilk" title="Buttermilk">buttermilk</a> or <a href="/wiki/Whey" title="Whey">whey</a>.

<p>Wine was commonly drunk and was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to <a href="/wiki/Galen" title="Galen">Galen</a>'s dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially <a href="/wiki/Red_wine" title="Red wine" class="mw-redirect">red wine</a>) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> and brighten the mood.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> The quality of wine differed considerably according to <a href="/wiki/Vintage" title="Vintage">vintage</a>, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually had to settle for a cheap white or <a href="/wiki/Ros%C3%A9" title="Rosé">rosé</a> from a second or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down <a href="/wiki/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">vinegar</a> would often be the only available choice.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" title=""><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The aging of high quality red wine required specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation must have been a widespread problem.

<p>While wine was the most common table beverage in much of Europe, this was not the case in the northern regions where grapes were not cultivated. Those who could afford it drank imported wine, but even for nobility in these areas it was common to drink <a href="/wiki/Beer" title="Beer">beer</a> or <a href="/wiki/Ale" title="Ale">ale</a>, particularly towards the end of the Middle Ages.

<p>The intoxicating effect of beer was believed to last longer than that of wine, but it was also admitted that it did not create the "false thirst" associated with wine. Though less prominent than in the north, beer was consumed in northern France and the Italian mainland. Perhaps as a consequence of the <a href="/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England" title="Norman conquest of England">Norman conquest</a> and the travelling of nobles between France and England, one French variant described in the 14th century <a href="/wiki/Cookbook" title="Cookbook">cookbook</a> <i>Le Menagier de Paris</i> was called <i>godale</i> (most likely a direct borrowing from the <a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> "good ale") and was made from barley and <a href="/wiki/Spelt" title="Spelt">spelt</a>, but without <a href="/wiki/Hops" title="Hops">hops</a>. In England there were also the variants <i><a href="/wiki/Posset" title="Posset">poset ale</a></i>, made from hot milk and cold ale, and <i>brakot</i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Mead#Mead_variants" title="Mead">braggot</a></i>, a spiced ale prepared much like <a href="/wiki/Hypocras" title="Hypocras">hypocras</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>That hops could be used for flavoring beer had been known at least since <a href="/wiki/Carolingian" title="Carolingian" class="mw-redirect">Carolingian</a> times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the discovery of hops, <a href="/wiki/Gruit" title="Gruit">gruit</a>, a mix of various <a href="/wiki/Herb" title="Herb">herbs</a>, had been used. Gruit did not have the same preserving properties as hops, and the end result had to be consumed quickly to avoid the inevitable spoiling. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. In the <a href="/wiki/Early_Middle_Ages" title="Early Middle Ages">Early Middle Ages</a> beer was primarily brewed in <a href="/wiki/Monastery" title="Monastery">monasteries</a>, and on a smaller scale in individual households. By the <a href="/wiki/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High Middle Ages</a> breweries in the fledgling <a href="/wiki/Medieval_commune" title="Medieval commune">medieval towns</a> of northern Germany began to take over production. Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people, regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques. These operations later spread to <a href="/wiki/Holland" title="Holland">Holland</a> in the 14th century, then to <a href="/wiki/Flanders" title="Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Brabant" title="Duchy of Brabant">Brabant</a>, and reached England by the 15th century. Hopped beer became very popular in the last decades of the <a href="/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages" title="Late Middle Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>. In England and the Low Countries, the per capita annual consumption was around 275–300&#160;<a href="/wiki/Litre" title="Litre">liters</a> (60–66&#160;<a href="/wiki/Gallon" title="Gallon">gallons</a>), and it was consumed with practically every meal: low alcohol-content beers for breakfast, and stronger ones later in the day. When perfected as an ingredient, hops could make beer keep for six months or more, and facilitated extensive exports.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title=""><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Research into medieval <a href="/wiki/Foodways" title="Foodways">foodways</a> was until around 1980 a much neglected field of study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, and are still present in as a part of the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backwards, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The latter specialty of many late medieval dishes was used to support the unsubstantiated claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion lacking any contemporary evidence. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it and the preservation techniques available at the time, though crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The high prestige of spices, and the reputation of the host paying for the meal, would have been effectively nullified if wasted on bad ingredients.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78" title=""><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The common method of grinding and mashing ingredients into pastes and the many potages and sauces has been used as an argument that most adults within the medieval nobility lost their teeth at an early age, and hence were forced to eat nothing but porridge, soup and ground-up meat. The image of nobles gumming their way through multi-course meals of nothing but mush has lived side by side with the contradictory apparition of the "mob of uncouth louts (disguised as noble lords) who, when not actually hurling huge joints of greasy meat at one another across the banquet hall, are engaged in tearing at them with a perfectly healthy complement of incisors, canines, bicuspids and molars".<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79" title=""><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Cookbook" title="Cookbook">Cookbooks</a>, or more specifically, recipe collections, compiled in the Middle Ages are among the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. Though it is assumed that they describe actual dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand in the kitchen while preparing a dish. The recipes were often very brief and with few precise quantities. Cooking times and proper temperatures were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done on fires, whether direct or indirect. At best, cooking times could be specified as the time it took to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade not through formal schooling but through apprenticeship and practical training. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historians like Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in most major European languages.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80" title=""><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

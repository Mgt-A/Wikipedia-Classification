<p><i>The Shield</i> was about an experimental division of the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department" title="Los Angeles Police Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a> set up in the fictional Farmington district ("the Farm") of <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California" class="mw-redirect">Los Angeles</a>, using a converted church ("the Barn") as their police station, and featuring a group of detectives called the Strike Team who will stop at nothing to bring their version of justice to the streets. <a href="/wiki/Michael_Chiklis" title="Michael Chiklis">Michael Chiklis</a> has top billing with his portrayal of Strike Team leader <a href="/wiki/Vic_Mackey" title="Vic Mackey">Vic Mackey</a>. The show has an <a href="/wiki/Ensemble_cast" title="Ensemble cast">ensemble cast</a> that will normally run a number of separate story lines through each episode.</p>
<p>Detective Vic Mackey was the leader of the Strike Team, a four-man anti-<a href="/wiki/Gang" title="Gang">gang</a> unit based on the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department" title="Los Angeles Police Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a>'s real-life <a href="/wiki/Rampart_Division" title="Rampart Division" class="mw-redirect">Rampart Division</a> <a href="/wiki/Community_Resources_against_Street_Hoodlums" title="Community Resources against Street Hoodlums" class="mw-redirect">CRASH</a> unit (<i>Rampart</i> was seriously considered as the series name and was even used in some early promotional ads for the series<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>). The Strike Team uses a variety of illegal and unethical methods to maintain peace on the streets, while making a profit through illegal drug protection schemes and robbery. The Strike Team isn't above planting drugs on and coercing confessions out of gang members or framing them. Attempts to give the team a fifth member have frequently led to near-catastrophe for the group.</p>
<p><i>The Shield</i> has a variety of subplots, notably David Aceveda's political aspirations and internal confrontation of a previous sexual assault; Vic Mackey's struggle to cope with a failing marriage; Shane Vendrell's rocky but burgeoning marriage; and Julien Lowe's internal conflicts between his belief in the teachings of the <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a> and his latent <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a>.</p>
<p>Common themes are the citizens' distrust of <a href="/wiki/Police" title="Police">police</a>, the social impact of drugs and gang warfare, and the conflict between ethics and political expediency. Most characters are portrayed as having both vice and virtue. For example, Vic's loving relationship with his children contrasts with his thuggish attitude towards police work; in addition, his brutality is generally directed at those who seem well-deserving of such treatment â in Season 2, the Strike Team prepares to rob the "Armenian Money Train," a money laundering operation of the <a href="/wiki/Armenian_Power" title="Armenian Power">Armenian Mafia</a>. Another episode had Mackey cornering a serial rapist, then letting him be mauled by a police dog before calling the dog off.</p>

<p><b>Season 1</b> premiered March 12, 2002. It gives an introduction to The Strike Team and the other characters of the Barn. Important plotlines are the aftermath of Vic's murder of Terry Crowley and Captain Aceveda's scheming to bring Vic and the Strike Team down; Dutch and Claudette's attempts at tracking down a serial killer; Julien's training under Danny and his struggle with his homosexuality; Vic's use of Rondell Robinson to control the local drug trade and the fallout; as well as the corrupt actions of Ben Gilroy.</p>

<p><b>Season 2</b> premiered January 7, 2003. The season mostly revolves around a brutal new drug lord, Armadillo--a sadistic child rapist, who likes to set his rivals on fire using a tire necklace and gasoline--who begins to take over the drug trade in Farmington. Meanwhile, Officer Sofer is involved in a shooting of a Muslim man and has to deal with the fallout. This season is also heavily concerned with the Strike Team's plan to rip off the money train of the Armenian Mob, which ends up going down in the season finale.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Shield&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Season 3">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season 3</span></h3>
<p><b>Season 3</b> premiered March 9, 2004. The season mainly revolves around the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/Money_Train_Heist" title="Money Train Heist" class="mw-redirect">Money Train Heist</a> and its effects on the Strike Team, as the Armenian mob and also David Aceveda begins to suspect the Strike Team. In order to save the team, Lem (Curtis "Lemonhead" Lemansky) burns a majority of the money, ultimately leading to a confrontation which causes the Strike Team to split up in the season finale. The Armenian mob sends Margos Dezerian to wipe out the Strike Team. Dezerian leaves a trail of murders, resulting in his own execution at the hands of Mackey. Claudette had been promised a promotion to captain and throughout the season was in a supervising role, while Aceveda prepared to move onto city council. Near the end of the season an assistant district attorney was shot, and Wyms and Dutch discovered she had been a heavy drug user for the past 3 years. Wyms explored further and became very unpopular with the D.A. and around the Barn because she was (against orders) reopening the assistant DA's closed cases. This resulted in her being denied her promotion to captain of the Farmington District.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Shield&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Season 4">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season 4</span></h3>
<p><b>Season 4</b> premiered March 15, 2005, with the addition of <a href="/wiki/Glenn_Close" title="Glenn Close">Glenn Close</a> taking over the role as Farmington's new captain, Monica Rawling. The season dealt with the fallout from the Strike Team disbandment. Shane Vendrell, with new partner Army, enters into a dangerous situation with major drug lord Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson), and seemingly accepts an order to kill Vic Mackey. The police were outraged after two officers were kidnapped and subsequently found murdered. In the end, the Strike Team is re-formed and manages to successfully put Antwon in prison. The season also deals with the controversial asset forfeiture policies of the new captain; Julien's opposition to these policies; and David Aceveda (now a City Councilman) dealing with the psychological aftermath of his sexual assault incident from the previous season. The season concludes with Captain Rawling losing her job over a dispute with the DEA. This plot twist reflected a real-life need for Glenn Close to return to New York.</p>
<p>One of the season's secondary plots involves Claudette and Dutch's marginalization as detectives because of Claudette's refusal to apologize to the DA for reopening the cases of a public defender who was discovered to be a functioning drug addict. Claudette's moral stand resulted in many of the prosecutor's cases being overturned. This cost Claudette her shot at becoming Farmington Captain. Dutch eventually resolved the situation by making a back-room deal with the DA to "keep Claudette in line" and do favors for the office in return for breaking back into action.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Shield&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Season 5">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season 5</span></h3>
<p><b>Season 5</b> premiered January 10, 2006. The season revolved around Internal Affairs Department Lt. <a href="/wiki/Jon_Kavanaugh" title="Jon Kavanaugh">Jon Kavanaugh</a>'s (played by <a href="/wiki/Forest_Whitaker" title="Forest Whitaker">Forest Whitaker</a>) investigation into the Strike Team, representing one of the greatest threats the team has ever faced. As a result of Kavanaugh turning one of Vic's informants, IAD became aware of Lem stealing heroin which he never turned in. Having found the heroin, IAD is capable of arresting Lem, but Kavanaugh wants him to incriminate the whole team and has him wear a wire, which he warns the team of and they use it to embarrass IAD. Kavanaugh puts on any form of pressure he can, finds out about Vic's share of the Money Train money, and ultimately arrests Lem having made a deal with Antwon Mitchell to put Lem there if convicted. Vic stands with him and gets bail, while Shane is worried he'll be turned. Claudette finally gets her shot as the captain of the Barn which she reluctantly accepts.

<p>The producers of <i>The Shield</i> produced a 15-minute "promosode", which premiered on <a href="/wiki/Google" title="Google">Google</a> on February 15, 2007 to bridge the gap between Seasons 5 and 6. The episode focuses on the aftermath of Lem's death, including his funeral and flashbacks as co-workers reflect upon Det. Lemansky's life. The episode was said to have cost between $500,000 and $1 million to produce and was on Bud.TV for a 4 week period and later released to AOL and other media outlets.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The "promosode" is also one of the special features included on the Season 5 DVD set.</p>

<p><b>Season 6</b> premiered on FX on April 3, 2007. Continuing directly after season 5, Vic and the Strike Team are distraught over Lem's death. Shane has been overcome by guilt and becomes reckless and suicidal. Kavanaugh refuses to let the case die and resorts to planting evidence and coercing witnesses to lie about the Strike Team and specifically, Vic. Dutch and Claudette begin to suspect his integrity and Kavanaugh finally confesses to his actions and finds himself under arrest. Vic learns from Claudette that the Chief plans to force him into early retirement â and vows to wreak bloody vengeance on Lem's killer before losing his badge. Claudette learns that the Barn could be shut down if no improvements are made by the time quarterly crime statistics are released. The season concludes with the breakdown of Vic and Shane's friendship and Shane getting in over his head with the Armenians.</p>
<p>Season 6 was originally intended to be aired as the second half of Season 5 (in the same way that HBO split up the last season of <a href="/wiki/The_Sopranos" title="The Sopranos">The Sopranos</a>); FX decided to refer to these ten episodes as "Season 6" instead.</p>

Vic's ex-wife Corinne has learned of his many crimes and agrees to work with Dutch and Claudette to try and send him to prison. Ronnie is also implicated in the process. Shane, Mara and Jackson go on the run and Dutch has problems of his own while dealing with a teenage serial killer. As part of an immunity deal with ICE, Vic admits to every crime the Strike Team has committed and implicates Shane and Ronnie in enough to send them to jail for life. After learning that there is no way to escape prison, Shane commits suicide after poisoning his pregnant wife and five-year old son. Claudette reveals the terminal status of her illness to Dutch, who promises to stand by her as a friend. Ronnie is arrested and prosecuted. Desperate to escape, Corinne and the children disappear into the <a href="/wiki/Witness_protection_program" title="Witness protection program" class="mw-redirect">witness protection program</a>. Aceveda stands on the verge of being elected mayor. Meanwhile, Vic is left trapped in a desk job at ICE, loathed by his co-workers and ostracized by his fellow cops, who want nothing to do with him now that his many crimes have been exposed.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Vic_Mackey" title="Vic Mackey">Detective Vic Mackey</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Chiklis" title="Michael Chiklis">Michael Chiklis</a>) is a corrupt police officer and former leader of the Strike Team; he steals from drug dealers, beats and <a href="/wiki/Torture" title="Torture">tortures</a> suspects, and has committed <a href="/wiki/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a> more than once, including a fellow police officer. A quintessential Machiavellian, Mackey sees his tactics as <a href="/wiki/Consequentialism" title="Consequentialism">a means to an end</a>. Vic perceives himself as a loyal father and partner, and does, indeed, seem to intend to fulfill those roles, but his pathological desire to control everyone and everything around him results in hurting those closest to him, primarily his ex-wife and daughter, but also Lemansky. Mackey's family life is followed throughout the series. His marriage to his wife, a nurse, failed after numerous instances of infidelity on Mackey's part (including with Officer Sofer, which resulted in a child). Mackey and his wife have three children, two with autism. The special education needs of Mackey's children are one of many sources of stress (monetary and emotional) for Mackey. After Corrine leaves him, he is granted immunity by ICE and then confesses to the Crowley murder. He finishes the series working behind a desk. He appears in all seasons of The Shield.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Shane_Vendrell" title="Shane Vendrell">Detective Shane Vendrell</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Walton_Goggins" title="Walton Goggins">Walton Goggins</a>) was Vic Mackey's best friend and partner before the strike team was formed. He has a reckless streak and his attempts to emulate Vic's dealings have quite often taken a bad turn. During the course of the series, he meets and marries his wife, Mara, who later bears him a son, Jackson. When it appears that Lem has turned on the Strike Team, Shane kills him by dropping a grenade into his car. The grief forced him to become reckless and suicidal and when Vic uncovers the truth, their friendship is truly over. Shane grows to regret his actions as part of the strike team and expresses great remorse for what he has become. When it is revealed that he paid someone to kill Ronnie Gardocki in retaliation for Vic and Ronnie's attempt on his own life, he goes on the run with his wife and son, and upon learning of Vic's immunity, he kills them and himself in a bid to remain a family, his mind impaired by drugs and guilt. He appears in all seasons of The Shield.</li>

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Curtis_Lemansky" title="Curtis Lemansky">Detective Curtis "Lem" Lemansky</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Kenny_Johnson" title="Kenny Johnson" class="mw-redirect">Kenny Johnson</a>) (Seasons 1-5) was a cop with a conscience. He had a history of working with kids, and maintained a soft-spot for them. His loyalty to Vic and the Strike Team led him to go along with most of their illegal schemes, although he didn't know about all of them-such as the murder of Terry Crowley. Often impulsive, he burned most of the money from the Armenian Money Train robbery in order to keep the team from getting caught, which caused a temporarily split within the team, although they later got back together. An original member of the Strike team, <a href="/wiki/Shane_Vendrell" title="Shane Vendrell">Shane Vendrell</a> killed Lemansky in the finale of the fifth season because he, Shane, was under the mistaken impression that Lemansky was going to rat on the rest of the team. Lem was unmarried and had no children.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Ronnie_Gardocki" title="Ronnie Gardocki">Detective Ronnie Gardocki</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/David_Rees_Snell" title="David Rees Snell">David Rees Snell</a>) is the Strike Team's surveillance and electronics expert. Though little is known about Ronnie, he has proven more and more in recent times to be the most solid, emotionally stable member of the Strike Team and has remained loyal to Vic out of enlightened self-interest, knowing that divisions between them would only lead to bad ends for both. The scars on his face, given to him by Armadillo in Season 2, are proof of his loyalty to the team. In the final season, he becomes the official leader of the Strike Team before Captain Claudette Wyms shuts it down. During season 7 we see his intense anger over his and Mackey's inability to gain revenge on Shane for Lem's murder. He and Vic concoct a plan to have Shane killed by the Armenian gang that knew about the Money Train robbery. Shane survives, however, and retaliates. Ronnie is targeted by a drug dealer hired by Shane to kill him. After the drug dealer confesses and Shane flees, Claudette disbands the strike team, forcing Ronnie to become a "suit and tie" detective while trying to help Vic and stay out of prison. In the final episode, Ronnie is arrested after Vic implicates him in his immunity confessions. He appears in seasons 5-7 as a regular character, and seasons 1-4 in a recurring role.</li>

He was killed by Vic, with Shane's knowledge, and the two framed a drug dealer for his death. Although Acevada had strong suspicions, he could never prove that Vic killed Terry. Vic would later be granted immunity for this murder by ICE, along with all of his other crimes.</li>

<li><b><a href="/wiki/David_Aceveda" title="David Aceveda">Councilman David Aceveda</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Benito_Martinez_(actor)" title="Benito Martinez (actor)">Benito Martinez</a>) is a politically ambitious man who was the captain of the Barn. He was later elected to the Los Angeles City Council. He is one of Vic Mackey's main rivals, although often they have forged uneasy alliances for various reasons. He was orally raped at gunpoint, which eventually drove him to arrange a deal with drug lord Antwon Mitchell to kill his rapist in prison. During the final season, Aceveda is faced with the growing influence of a Cruz Pezuela who offers to seemingly help David get elected as the next Mayor. Although receptive to his help at first, Aceveda realizes that Pezuela is dirty and attempts to distance himself only to find the Pezuela has photographs of the sexual assault. The last season deals with him and Vic cooperating one last time as they attempt to take Pezuela and possibly the Mexican cartel down. He appears in all seasons of The Shield.</li>

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Claudette_Wyms" title="Claudette Wyms">Captain Claudette Wyms</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/CCH_Pounder" title="CCH Pounder">CCH Pounder</a>) is a veteran detective. Claudette, along with her partner Dutch, can be viewed as the voice of morality at the Barn; as a result, she is often at odds with Vic over his tactics. Later in the series, Claudette revealed to Dutch that she has had <a href="/wiki/Lupus_erythematosus" title="Lupus erythematosus">lupus</a> for fifteen years. In Season 5, she is appointed Captain after several attempts in previous years. After finally being promoted to captain, Claudette proves to be at least as capable as her predecessors. However, during the final season, her lupus returns and begins to interfere with her ability to do her job. In the final episode, she admits to Dutch that she is in the terminal stage of her illness. She appears in all seasons of The Shield.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Holland_%22Dutch%22_Wagenbach" title="Holland &quot;Dutch&quot; Wagenbach">Detective Holland "Dutch" Wagenbach</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Jay_Karnes" title="Jay Karnes">Jay Karnes</a>) is characterized by many as a socially inept nerd even though he is a successful police detective. Assigned to the Farmington District of Los Angeles, he is often the first called to investigate violent crimes because of his specialization in criminal profiling and serial killers. Along with his partner, Detective Claudette Wyms, Dutch is widely considered to be the moral center of the show owing to his willingness to do the right thing in spite of the temptation to engage in illegal police activities. A scene in one episode showed him strangling a live cat after questioning an actual serial killer about what he sees in his victim's eyes.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The series never follows-up on that ominous scene, but neither does Dutch ever perform a similar act of cruelty. Vic, via flashback, is influenced in his decision to pick on Dutch by a fellow detective at the Barn who Dutch admires, and Dutch's clearly vengeful relationship with Vic's ex-wife did not help, but after Dutch actually challenges Vic to a fight in Season 4, Vic ends the bullying, even inviting Dutch and Claudette out to a bar with them, which every officer, minus Captain Rawlings, attends. He appears in all seasons of The Shield.</li>

She has an on-again-off-again sexual relationship with Vic and a complicated history with Dutch. She is assigned desk duty as a result of her pregnancy and takes maternity leave after the birth of her son, Lee. The identity of the father was initially unknown; later, in the sixth season episode "Chasing Ghosts," it was heavily implied that it was Vic. Shortly afterwards, Danny returned from maternity leave early so that she could take the position of Sergeant at the Barn. In Season Seven Vic threatens to force Danny to take a paternity test. She appears in all seasons of The Shield.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Julien_Lowe" title="Julien Lowe">Officer Julien Lowe</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Jace" title="Michael Jace">Michael Jace</a>) is a uniformed officer who is partnered with Sofer for the majority of the series. During the formation of a new Strike Team, Claudette offered Julien to Kevin Hiatt as a possible addition to the team. Claudette made the offer to Julien, who was hesitant, mainly because of the thought of being partnered with Vic on a daily basis. After being assured that Mackey was going to be moved out of the team, Julien accepted the promotion. Despite his desire to become a fully functioning member of the Strike Team, Julien knew that he was on the outside of the clique. When the Strike Team is dissolved for the final time, he becomes a uniformed officer again. He is asked to choose which side he will be on when Claudette finally has a case to go after Mackey and Vendrell. A recurring plotline for Lowe is the conflict between his Christian beliefs and his homosexuality, to the point where he goes to a sexual reorientation program and marries a woman. He appears in all seasons of The Shield.</li>

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Monica_Rawling" title="Monica Rawling">Captain Monica Rawling</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Glenn_Close" title="Glenn Close">Glenn Close</a>) (Season 4) was the appointed Captain at the Barn who took over from Acevada, after Claudette was rejected. She implemented a lot of changes, such as fixing the Barn's male toilets and, more importantly, creating seizure policies which proved to be somewhat controversial. She had a longstanding hatred with gang leader <a href="/wiki/Antwon_Mitchell" title="Antwon Mitchell">Antwon Mitchell</a> and was suspicious of Vic Mackey, even having him and his team investigated. She finds out that Shane was solicited by Mitchell to kill Vic. She is fired after she embarrasses the FBI by voiding the immunity deal they granted Mitchell (by getting the Strike Team to catch a Salvadoran cartel leader before Mitchell's information could), and the feds threaten to cut off all federal highway funding to L.A. if Rawlings stayed.</li>

She works as a nurse and once had a brief courtship with Dutch. Despite needing Vic in her life, she eventually turns on him and helps Dutch and Claudette build a case to send Vic behind bars.

He is known for his schemes, such as suing the department and bringing his own vending machines into the barn. He usually brings Dutch in on his plots and the two have come to blows on at least one occasion. Billings and Dutch were partnered together after Claudette got promoted to Captain which prompted Dutch to request a transfer which Claudette denies. He is injured during a brawl between Kanaghah and Vic and plans to sue the department for two million dollars, although he settles for two days pay from the time he missed.</li>

She is very attractive and well aware of her sexuality, which often earns her the ire of Danny Sofer. Tina's constant mistakes would have seen her out of the force, had it not been for a bungle in which Billings, while trying to see who was stealing from his vending machines, obtained photos of her changing. He involved Dutch and, in order to protect her old partner, Claudette allowed Tina to remain on the force under Dutch's supervision. She left the Barn after being made a spokesperson for the police force, but opted to transfer back. She had a sexual tryst with Kevin Hiatt, which was organized by Billings, although she later expressed regret and said that Dutch always had a chance with her, only he never took it. The day in which Shane Vendrell killed himself was her 1 year mark of being an officer and, although being harsh on her at times, Julien celebrated by buying her a cake and throwing her a little party.</li>

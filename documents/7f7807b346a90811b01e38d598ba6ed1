<p>The <i>Enron scandal</i> was a financial scandal involving <b><a href="/wiki/Enron" title="Enron">Enron</a> Corporation</b> (former <a href="/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange" title="New York Stock Exchange">NYSE</a> ticker symbol: ENE) and its accounting firm <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Andersen" title="Arthur Andersen">Arthur Andersen</a>, that was revealed in late 2001. After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron was on the verge of bankruptcy by November 2001. A <a href="/wiki/White_knight_(business)" title="White knight (business)">white knight</a> rescue attempt by a similar, smaller energy company, <a href="/wiki/Dynegy" title="Dynegy">Dynegy</a>, was not viable.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The text in the vicinity of this tag needs clarification or removal of jargon&#160;from March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify">clarification needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Enron filed for <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> on December 2, 2001.</p>
<p>As the scandal was revealed, Enron shares dropped from over US$90.00 to less than 50¢. Enron's plunge occurred after revelations that much of its profits and revenue were the result of deals with <a href="/wiki/Special_purpose_entity" title="Special purpose entity">special purpose entities</a> (<a href="/wiki/Limited_partnership" title="Limited partnership">limited partnerships</a> which it controlled). The result was that many of Enron's debts and the losses that it suffered were not reported in its <a href="/wiki/Financial_statements" title="Financial statements">financial statements</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the scandal caused the dissolution of <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Andersen" title="Arthur Andersen">Arthur Andersen</a>, which at the time was one of the five largest <a href="/wiki/Accounting" title="Accounting" class="mw-redirect">accounting</a> firms in the world.</p>

<p>Enron had created offshore entities, units which may be used for planning and avoidance of taxes, raising the profitability of a business. The names of these SPEs, or <a href="/wiki/Special_purpose_entity" title="Special purpose entity">special purpose entities</a>, were Bob West Treasure, Jedi and Hawaii <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/feb/22/banking.useconomy" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/feb/22/banking.useconomy" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. This provided ownership and management with full freedom of currency movement, and full anonymity, that would keep losses the company was taking off of the balance sheets. These entities made Enron look more profitable than it actually was, and created a dangerous spiral in which each quarter, corporate officers would have to perform more and more contorted financial deception to create the illusion of billions in profits while the company was actually losing money. This practice drove up their stock price to new levels, at which point the executives began to work on insider information and trade millions of dollars worth of Enron stock. The executives and insiders at Enron knew about the offshore accounts that were hiding losses for the company; however, the investors knew nothing of this. <a href="/wiki/Chief_Financial_Officer" title="Chief Financial Officer" class="mw-redirect">Chief Financial Officer</a> <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Fastow" title="Andrew Fastow">Andrew Fastow</a> led the team which created the off-books companies, and manipulated the deals to provide himself, his family, and his friends with hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed revenue, at the expense of the corporation he worked for and its stockholders.</p>
<p>In 1999, Enron launched <a href="/wiki/EnronOnline" title="EnronOnline" class="mw-redirect">EnronOnline</a>, an Internet-based trading operation, which was used by virtually every energy company in the United States. President and chief operating officer <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Skilling" title="Jeffrey Skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</a> began advocating a novel idea: the company did not really need any "assets." By pushing the company's aggressive investment strategy, he helped make Enron the biggest wholesaler of gas and electricity, with $27 billion traded in a quarter. The firm's figures, however, had to be accepted at face value. Under Skilling, Enron adopted <a href="/wiki/Mark_to_market" title="Mark to market" class="mw-redirect">mark to market</a> accounting, in which anticipated future profits from any deal were tabulated as if real today. Thus, Enron could record gains from what over time might turn out losses, as the company's fiscal health became secondary to manipulating its stock price on <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Tech_boom" title="Tech boom" class="mw-redirect">Tech boom</a>. But when a company's success is measured by agreeable financial statements emerging from a <a href="/wiki/Black_box" title="Black box">black box</a>, a term Skilling himself admitted, actual balance sheets prove inconvenient. Indeed, Enron's unscrupulous actions were often gambles to keep the deception going and so push up the stock price, which was posted daily in the company elevator. An advancing number meant a continued infusion of investor capital on which debt-ridden Enron in large part subsisted. Its fall would collapse the <a href="/wiki/House_of_cards" title="House of cards">house of cards</a>. Under pressure to maintain the illusion, Skilling verbally attacked Wall Street Analyst <a href="/w/index.php?title=Richard_Grubman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Richard Grubman (page does not exist)">Richard Grubman</a><sup id="cite_ref-million_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-million-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>, who questioned Enron's unusual accounting practice during a recorded conference call. When Grubman complained that Enron was the only company that could not release a balance sheet along with its earnings statements, Skilling replied "Well, thank you very much, we appreciate that . . . asshole." Though the comment was met with dismay and astonishment by press and public, it became an inside joke among many Enron employees, mocking Grubman for his perceived meddling rather than Skilling's lack of tact.<sup id="cite_ref-SmartestBook_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SmartestBook-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By the late 1990s Enron's stock was trading for $80–90 per share, and few seemed to concern themselves with the opacity of the company's financial disclosures. In mid July 2001, Enron reported <a href="/wiki/Earnings" title="Earnings" class="mw-redirect">earnings</a> of $50.1 billion, almost triple year-to-date, beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite this, Enron's profit margin had stayed at a modest average of about 2.1%, and its share price had dropped by over 30% since the same quarter of 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>However, concerns were mounting. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in running a new broadband communications trading unit, constructing the <a href="/wiki/Dabhol_Power_Company" title="Dabhol Power Company">Dabhol Power project</a>, a large <a href="/wiki/Power_plant" title="Power plant" class="mw-redirect">power plant</a> in India, and criticism of the company for the role it allegedly had played in the <a href="/wiki/California_electricity_crisis" title="California electricity crisis">power crisis of California in 2000-2001</a>.</p>

<p>The next day, however, Skilling admitted that a very significant reason for his departure was Enron's faltering price in the stock market.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The columnist <a href="/wiki/Paul_Krugman" title="Paul Krugman">Paul Krugman</a>, writing in the NY Times, asserted that Enron was an illustration of the consequences that occur from the deregulation and commodification of things such as energy.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> A few days later, in a letter to the editor, Kenneth Lay defended Enron and the philosophy behind the company:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">

<p>The broader goal of [Krugman's] latest attack on Enron appears to be to discredit the free-market system, a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of monopolies controlled or sponsored by government to make choices for people. We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.</p>
<p>The example Mr. Krugman cites of "<a href="/wiki/Financialization" title="Financialization">financialization</a>" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step. Indeed, the only winners in the California fiasco were the government-owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia.

In addition, the company admitted to repeatedly using "related-party transactions," which some feared could be too-easily used to transfer losses that might otherwise appear on Enron's own balance sheet. A particularly troubling aspect of this technique was that several of the "related-party" entities had been or were being controlled by Enron's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Andrew Fastow.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On October 17, 2001, Enron announced that its third-quarter results were negative due to one-time charges of over $1 billion. Enron management claimed the losses were mostly due to investment losses, along with charges such as about $180 million in money spent restructuring the company's troubled broadband trading unit. "After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses," said Kenneth Lay in a statement.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Some analysts were unnerved. "What's next?," asked <a href="/wiki/David_Fleischer" title="David Fleischer" class="mw-redirect">David Fleischer</a> at <a href="/wiki/Goldman_Sachs" title="Goldman Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a>, an analyst called previously 'one of the company's strongest supporters' <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> asserting that the Enron management "lost credibility and have to reprove themselves.

<p>Additionally Enron asserted that the broadband unit alone was worth $35 billion, a claim also mistrusted. "I don't think anyone knows what the broadband operation is worth," said Todd Shipman, an analyst at <a href="/wiki/Standard_%26_Poor%27s" title="Standard &amp; Poor's">Standard &amp; Poor's</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On October 22, 2001, the share price of Enron fell to $20.65, down $5.40 in one day, following the <a href="/wiki/SEC" title="SEC" class="mw-redirect">SEC</a>'s announcement that it was investigating several suspicious deals struck by Enron, pronouncing "some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen".<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> Attempting to explain the billion dollar charge and calm investors, Enron's disclosures spoke of "share settled costless collar arrangements," "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted <a href="/wiki/Forward_contract" title="Forward contract">forward contracts</a>," and strategies that served "to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets." Such puzzling phraseology left many analysts feeling ignorant about just how Enron ran its business.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Concerns about Enron's <a href="/wiki/Liquidity" title="Liquidity" class="mw-redirect">liquidity</a> prompted Lay to participate in a <a href="/wiki/Conference_call" title="Conference call">conference call</a> on Oct. 23, in which he attempted to reassure investors that the company's cash resources were ample and no further "one-time charges" loomed. Secondly, Lay adamantly insisted there were no improprieties regarding Enron's transactions with partnerships run by <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Fastow" title="Andrew Fastow">Andrew Fastow</a>. Lay emphasized his support for Fastow.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> David Fleischer, the analyst at Goldman, was again skeptical, telling Lay and Fastow, "There is an appearance that you are hiding something." Nevertheless, Fleischer persisted in recommending the stock, arguing that he didn't "think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans."<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Lay also attempted to reassure the conferees by stressing that all of Enron's financial and accounting maneuvers had been scrutinized by their auditor, Arthur Andersen. After several questioners pressed the issue, Lay stated Enron management would "look into providing" more detailed statements for the end of better understanding the company's relationship with the special entities as those run by Fastow.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Two days later, on October 25, 2001, despite his reassurances days earlier, Kenneth Lay removed Fastow from his position. Enron's stock was now trading at $16.41, having lost half its value in a little over a week. "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.," said Lay in the statement announcing Fastow's exit.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> However, with Skilling and Fastow now both departed, some analysts feared that shedding light on the company's practices would be made all the more difficult.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On October 27 the company began buying back all its <a href="/wiki/Commercial_paper" title="Commercial paper">commercial paper</a>, valued at around $3.3 billion, in an effort to keep investors from fearing about Enron's supply of cash. Enron financed the re-purchase by depleting its <a href="/wiki/Line_of_credit" title="Line of credit">lines of credit</a> at several banks. While the company's <a href="/wiki/Debt_rating" title="Debt rating" class="mw-redirect">debt rating</a> was still considered <a href="/wiki/Investment-grade" title="Investment-grade" class="mw-redirect">investment-grade</a>, its <a href="/wiki/Bond_(finance)" title="Bond (finance)">bonds</a> were trading at levels slightly below, making future sales problematic.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As October 2001 came to a close, serious concerns were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, some claimed analysis was impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Some now openly feared that Enron was the new <a href="/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management" title="Long-Term Capital Management">Long-Term Capital Management</a>, the hedge fund whose collapse in 1998 threatened systemic failure in the international financial markets.

<p>The central short-term danger to Enron's survival at the end of October 2001 seemed to be its credit rating. It was reported at the time that <a href="/wiki/Moody%27s" title="Moody's">Moody's</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fitch_Ratings" title="Fitch Ratings" class="mw-redirect">Fitch</a>, two of the three biggest credit-rating agencies, had slated Enron for review for possible downgrade.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Such a downgrade would force Enron to issue millions of shares of stock to cover loans it had guaranteed, a move that would bring down the value of existing stock further.</p>
<p>Additionally, all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with Enron, especially in the long term, in the event that Enron's rating were lowered below investment grade, a possible hindrance in future transactions.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Analysts and observers continued their chorus of complaints regarding Enron's difficulty or impossibility of properly assessing a company whose financial statements were so mysterious. Some feared that no one at Enron apart from Skilling and Fastow could completely explain years of mysterious transactions. "You're getting way over my head," said Ken Lay in late August 2001 in response to detailed questions about Enron's business, a reaction that worried analysts.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On October 29, 2001, responding to growing concerns that Enron might in the short-term have insufficient cash on hand, the news spread that Enron was seeking a further $1–2 billion in financing from the banks.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The next day, as feared, Moody's lowered Enron's credit rating, or senior unsecured long-term debt ratings, to Baa2, two levels above so-called <a href="/wiki/Junk_bond" title="Junk bond" class="mw-redirect">junk status</a>, from Baa1. Standard &amp; Poor's also lowered their rating to BBB+, the equivalent of Moody's rating. Moody's also warned that it might downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, the consequence of which might be preventing the company from finding the further financing it sought to keep solvent.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>November began with the disclosure that the SEC was now pursuing a formal investigation, prompted by questions related to Enron's dealings with "related parties". Enron's board also announced that it would commission a special committee to investigate the transactions, headed by <a href="/wiki/William_C._Powers" title="William C. Powers">William C. Powers</a>, the dean of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Texas" title="University of Texas" class="mw-redirect">University of Texas</a> law school. "We welcome this request" to cooperate with the SEC, said Kenneth Lay in a statement.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> The next day, an editorial in the New York Times called for an "aggressive" investigation into the matter.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On November 2, 2001 Enron succeeded in securing an additional $1 billion in financing, but the news was not universally admired in that the debt was secured with the company's valuable <a href="/w/index.php?title=Northern_Natural_Gas_and_Transwestern_Pipeline&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline (page does not exist)">Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45" title=""><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Sources claimed that Enron was planning to explain its business practices more fully within the coming days, as a confidence-building gesture.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46" title=""><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> Enron's stock was now trading at around $7, as investors worried that the company would not be able to find a buyer.</p>
<p>After it received a wide spectrum of rejections, Enron management apparently found a buyer when the board of <a href="/wiki/Dynegy" title="Dynegy">Dynegy</a>, another energy trader based in <a href="/wiki/Houston,_TX" title="Houston, TX" class="mw-redirect">Houston, TX</a>, voted late at night on November 7 to acquire Enron "at a fire-sale price"<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47" title=""><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> or about $8 billion in stock. Chevron Texaco, which at the time owned about a quarter of Dynegy, agreed to provide Enron with $2.5 billion in cash, specifically $1 billion up front and the rest when the deal was completed. Dynegy would also be required to assume nearly $13 billion of debt, plus any other debt hitherto occluded by the Enron management's secretive business practices<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup>, possibly as much as $10 billion in "hidden" debt.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> Dynegy and Enron confirmed their deal on November 8, 2001.</p>
<p>Commentators remarked on the different corporate cultures between Dynegy and Enron, and on the "straight-talking" personality of the CEO of Dynegy, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Watson_(businessman)" title="Charles Watson (businessman)">Charles Watson</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50" title=""><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> Some wondered if Enron's troubles had not simply been the result of innocent accounting errors.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51" title=""><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup> By November, Enron was asserting that the billion-plus "one-time charges" disclosed in October should in reality have been $200 million, with the rest of the amount simply corrections of dormant accounting mistakes.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52" title=""><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> Many feared other "mistakes" and restatements might yet be revealed.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53" title=""><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>November 9, 2001 brought with it another major correction of Enron's earnings with a reduction of $591 million over the stated revenue of years 1997-2000. The charges were said to come largely from two special purpose partnerships, called "JEDI" and "Chewco". The corrections resulted in the virtual elimination of profit for fiscal year 1997, with significant reductions every other year. Nevertheless Dynegy was reported to have not lost interest in purchasing Enron despite this disclosure.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> Both companies were said to be anxious to receive an official assessment of the proposed sale from Moody's and S&amp;P (considered by some a "do or die"<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> deal for Enron) presumably to understand the effect on Dynegy and Enron's credit rating the completion of any buyout transaction. In addition, concerns were raised regarding antitrust regulatory hurdles leading to possible <a href="/wiki/Divestiture" title="Divestiture" class="mw-redirect">divestiture</a>, along with what to some observers were the radically different corporate cultures of Enron and Dynegy.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" title=""><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless both companies pushed aggressively for the deal, and some observers were hopeful; Charles Watson was praised for his vision in attempting to create the biggest presence on the energy market in one fell swoop.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57" title=""><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> "We feel [Enron] is a very solid company with plenty of capacity to withstand whatever happens the next few months," said Watson at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58" title=""><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup> One analyst called the deal "a whopper [...] a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron."<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59" title=""><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Credit issues were becoming more critical, however. Around the time the buyout was made public, Moody's and S&amp;P both lowered Enron's rating to just one notch above junk status. Were the company's rating to fall below investment-grade, its ability to trade might be severely limited subsequent to a curtailment or elimination of its credit lines with competitors.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> In a conference call, S&amp;P affirmed that, were Enron not to be taken over, S&amp;P would cut its rating cut to low BB or high B, ratings "not even at the high end of junk".<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title=""><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup> Furthermore many traders had limited their doing business with Enron, or stopped altogether, fearing more bad news. But Watson again attempted to re-assure, affirming during a presentation to investors in New York that there was "nothing wrong with Enron's business."<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup> He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more <a href="/wiki/Stock_option" title="Stock option" class="mw-redirect">stock options</a>) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees for management after it was revealed that Lay and other top officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock in the months leading up to the crisis.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Kenneth Lay, his "reputation in tatters"<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64" title=""><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup>, stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, and this while many Enron employees had seen their retirement accounts, which were largely based on Enron stock, decimated as the price fell 90% in a year. "We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000," said an official at a company owned by Enron. "It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan."<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65" title=""><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Watson assured investors that the true nature of Enron's business had been made clear to him: "We have comfort there is not another shoe to drop. If there is no shoe, this is a phenomenally good transaction," he said at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66" title=""><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> Watson further asserted that Enron's energy trading part alone was worth the price Dynegy was paying for the whole company.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67" title=""><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>By mid-November, Enron announced it was planning to sell about $8 billion worth of underperforming assets, along with a general plan to reduce its scale for the sake of financial stability.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68" title=""><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On November 19, 2001 Enron disclosed to the public further evidence of its critical state of affairs. Most pressingly that the company was facing debt repayment obligations in the range of $9 billion by the end of 2002. Such debts were "vastly in excess" of its available cash.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69" title=""><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup> Also, the success of measures to preserve its solvency were not guaranteed, specifically as regarded asset sales and debt refinancing. "An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," said Enron in a statement.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70" title=""><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Two days later, on November 21, Wall Street was expressing serious doubts that Dynegy would proceed with its deal at all, or would seek to radically renegotiate. Furthermore Enron revealed in a <a href="/wiki/Form_10-Q" title="Form 10-Q">10Q filing</a> that almost all the money it had recently borrowed for purposes including buying its commercial paper, or about $5 billion, had been exhausted in just 50 days. Analysts were unnerved at the revelation, especially since Dynegy was reported to also have been unaware of Enron's rate of cash use.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71" title=""><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In order to walk away from the proposed buyout, Dynegy would need to legally demonstrate a "material change" in the circumstances of the transaction; as late as November 22, sources close to Dynegy were skeptical that the latest revelations constituted sufficient grounds.<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72" title=""><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The SEC announced it had filed civil fraud complaints against <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Andersen" title="Arthur Andersen">Arthur Andersen LLP</a>, Enron's auditor.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73" title=""><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> A few days later, sources claimed Enron and Dynegy were now actively renegotiating the terms of their arrangement.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74" title=""><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup> Dynegy now demanded Enron agree to be bought for $4 billion rather than the previous $8 billion. Observers were reporting difficulties in ascertaining whether or which of Enron's operations, if any, were profitable. Reports described an en masse shift of business to Enron's competitors for the sake of risk exposure reduction. Finally, a new report from Moody's made Wall Street nervous.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75" title=""><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On November 28, 2001, Enron's two worst outcomes came true. Dynegy Inc. unilaterally disengaged from the proposed acquisition of the company and Enron's credit rating fell to junk status. The company, having very little cash with which to run its business, let alone satisfy enormous debts, imploded. Its stock price fell to $0.61 at the end of the day's trading. "Enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm," wrote one editorial observer.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76" title=""><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Systemic consequences were felt, as Enron's creditors and other energy trading companies suffered the loss of several percentage points. Some analysts felt Enron's failure highlighted the risks of the post-September 11 economy, and encouraged traders to lock in profits where they could.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77" title=""><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The question now became determining the total exposure of the markets and other traders to Enron's failure. Early figures put the number at $18.7 billion. "We don't really know who is out there exposed to Enron's credit," said one adviser. "I'm telling my clients to prepare for the worst."<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78" title=""><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Enron was estimated to have about $23 billion in liabilities, both debt outstanding and guaranteed loans. <a href="/wiki/Citigroup" title="Citigroup">Citigroup</a> and <a href="/wiki/JP_Morgan_Chase" title="JP Morgan Chase" class="mw-redirect">JP Morgan Chase</a> in particular appeared to have significant amounts to lose with Enron's fall. Additionally, many of Enron's major assets were pledged to lenders in order to secure loans, throwing into doubt what if anything unsecured creditors and eventually stockholders might receive in bankruptcy proceedings.<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79" title=""><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Enron's European operations filed for bankruptcy on November 30, 2001, and it sought <a href="/wiki/Chapter_11" title="Chapter 11" class="mw-redirect">Chapter 11</a> protection in the U.S. two days later on December 2.

<p>Kenneth Lay, the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Skilling" title="Jeffrey Skilling">Jeffrey Skilling</a>, former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, went on <a href="/wiki/Trial_(law)" title="Trial (law)">trial</a> for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page <a href="/wiki/Indictment" title="Indictment">indictment</a> covers a broad range of financial crimes, including <a href="/wiki/Bank_fraud" title="Bank fraud">bank fraud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Making_false_statements" title="Making false statements">making false statements</a> to banks and auditors, <a href="/wiki/Securities_fraud" title="Securities fraud">securities fraud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wire_fraud" title="Wire fraud">wire fraud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Money_laundering" title="Money laundering">money laundering</a>, conspiracy and insider trading. U.S. <a href="/wiki/United_States_federal_judge" title="United States federal judge">District Judge</a> Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to hold separate trials and to move the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity surrounding Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial.</p>
<p>Lay pleaded not guilty to the eleven criminal charges. Lay stated that he was misled by those around him. At the time of his death in July, 2006 the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" title="U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines.</p>

The one <a href="/wiki/Felony" title="Felony">felony</a> charge against Rieker carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison and a $1 million fine. Rieker agreed never again to serve as an officer or director of a public company. If a federal court approves the settlement, Rieker will pay the SEC $499,333, the profit from the sale of 18,380 shares of Enron stock.

<p>Enron's party insolvency took the form of a liquidation, rather than a restructuring, as initially expected, and even announced on the company's website. Assets considered "non-core", such as Enron's energy and bandwidth trading businesses, the <a href="/wiki/Enron_Wind" title="Enron Wind">Enron Wind</a> energy unit, and the IT consulting businesses, were divested. Also included in the divestiture process were oil field services company <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mariner_Energy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mariner Energy (page does not exist)">Mariner Energy</a> (in which Enron held a 98% controlling interest) and <a href="/w/index.php?title=INSELA&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="INSELA (page does not exist)">INSELA</a>, a Venezuelan gas valve and electrical equipment manufacturer in which Enron held 50%.

<p>Enron's sole electric utility in the United States, <a href="/wiki/Portland_General_Electric" title="Portland General Electric">Portland General Electric</a>, was spun off as an independent company in 2006, with its shares disbursed to creditors.</p>
<p>The remainder of Enron's operations were reorganized under two major subsidiaries formed in 2003: <a href="/w/index.php?title=CrossCountry_Energy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="CrossCountry Energy (page does not exist)">CrossCountry Energy</a>, consisting of Enron's domestic gas pipeline interests; and <a href="/wiki/Prisma_Energy_International" title="Prisma Energy International">Prisma Energy International</a>, formed from most of Enron's global electricity generation and distribution businesses, formerly referred to as "Enron International". CrossCountry Energy was sold to <a href="/w/index.php?title=CCE_Holdings&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="CCE Holdings (page does not exist)">CCE Holdings</a>, a joint venture of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Southern_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Southern Union (page does not exist)">Southern Union</a> and a unit of <a href="/wiki/General_Electric" title="General Electric">General Electric</a>, in 2004. The spin-off of Portland General Electric in 2005 left Prisma Energy as Enron's last major business asset. Prisma Energy itself was ultimately sold to <a href="/w/index.php?title=Ashmore_Energy_International&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ashmore Energy International (page does not exist)">Ashmore Energy International</a> in 2006, leaving Enron Corp. as a non-trading "shell" company, now in the final stage of its bankruptcy liquidation. Between the initial proposal of the reorganization plan in 2002, and the formal creation of Prisma Energy International and CrossCountry Energy in 2003, the two proposed companies were referred to within Enron as "InternationalCo" and "PipeCo" respectively.</p>
<p>To reflect its new status as a largely asset-less shell existing solely to manage final payouts to creditors, Enron changed its legal, corporate name to "Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation", d/b/a Enron Corporation, in early 2007.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of Enron's few remaining assets is <a href="/w/index.php?title=DealBench&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="DealBench (page does not exist)">DealBench</a>, an online transaction and divestiture service, once part of the now defunct <a href="/wiki/EnronOnline" title="EnronOnline" class="mw-redirect">EnronOnline</a>.</p>

<p>The long-term trials and implications of Enron's collapse are somewhat unclear, but there is considerable political fallout both in the U.S. and in the UK relating to the money Enron gave to political figures (around US$7 million since 1990). During <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Clinton</a>'s eight years in office, the company and Lay contributed about $900,000 to the <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic Party</a>. In 1999 and 2000, the company gave $362,000 in soft-money donations to Democrats. Since 1996, between 72% and 94% of yearly American contributions went to the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a>, including heavy contributions to <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W.

<p>Fallout from the scandal quickly extended beyond Enron and all those formerly associated with it. The trial of <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Andersen" title="Arthur Andersen">Arthur Andersen LLP</a> on charges of <a href="/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice" title="Obstruction of justice">obstruction of justice</a> related to Enron helped to expose accounting fraud at <a href="/wiki/WorldCom" title="WorldCom" class="mw-redirect">WorldCom</a>.

This wave engulfed many companies, exposing high-level corruption, accounting errors, and <a href="/wiki/Insider_trading" title="Insider trading">insider trading</a>. Though at the time of its collapse, Enron was the largest bankruptcy in history, this has been eclipsed by the collapse of <a href="/wiki/WorldCom" title="WorldCom" class="mw-redirect">WorldCom</a> and most recently, <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers" title="Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers">the collapse of Lehman Brothers</a>.</p>

<p>Ben Glisan Jr., a former Enron <a href="/wiki/Treasurer" title="Treasurer">treasurer</a>, was the first man to be sent to <a href="/wiki/Prison" title="Prison">prison</a> in the Enron scandal.

Michael Kopper, along with Ben Glisan, was closely tied to Andrew Fastow during the Enron Scandal. Kopper was recruited from the Toronto Dominion Bank, where he occupied a role in structured financing. He joined Enron at the young age of 29 as a managing director of Enron Global Finance, and, as expected, quickly became a "valuable asset to the company". Nonetheless, Kopper would be one of the main ingredients in Enrons recipe for disaster when he, along with Glisan, would help Fastow create the off-balance sheets for the corporation.</p>
<p>Although Michael Kopper worked for Enron for over seven years before the scandal became public, he was always under the radar. Kenneth Lay, Enron CEO, did not know of Kopper even after the company's bankruptcy.

Since the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission" title="U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> does not allow convicted felons to audit public companies, the firm agreed to surrender its <a href="/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant" title="Certified Public Accountant">Certified Public Accountant</a> licenses and its right to practice before the SEC on August 31. On May 31, 2005, the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> unanimously overturned Andersen's conviction due to flaws in the jury instructions. Despite this ruling, Andersen has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale. There are over 100 civil suits pending against the firm related to its audits of Enron and other companies. It began winding down its American operations after the indictment. From a high of 28,000 employees in the U.S. and 85,000 worldwide, the firm is now down to around 200 based primarily in Chicago. Most of their attention is on handling the lawsuits.</p>
<p>Andersen was one of the "Big Five" large international accounting firms. Its demise left only four big international accounting firms (now called the <a href="/wiki/Big_Four_auditors" title="Big Four auditors">Big Four</a>). This concentration of the industry is still causing difficulty for large corporations that need to use more than one accounting firm for auditing and non-auditing services. In addition, the pricing of accounting services is less elastic as large corporations feel that they must use a Big Four firm.</p>

<p>Enron's collapse also contributed to the creation of the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Sarbanes-Oxley_Act" title="Sarbanes-Oxley Act">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a> (SOX), signed into law on July 30, 2002.

Other countries have also adopted new <a href="/wiki/Corporate_governance" title="Corporate governance">corporate governance</a> legislations. This law provides stronger penalties for fraud and, among other things, requires public companies to avoid making loans to management, to report more information to the public, to maintain stronger independence from their auditors, and most controversially, to report on and have audited, their financial internal control procedures. However, certain provisions in the legislation are currently under review in Congress....</p>

<p>On April 8, 2002, Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman &amp; Robbins, LLP attorneys led by <a href="/wiki/William_Lerach" title="William Lerach">William Lerach</a> filed a consolidated class action lawsuit against Enron Corp. in the U.S. District Court in Houston. On behalf of its clients, Lerach Coughlin seeks relief for purchasers of Enron publicly traded equity and debt securities between October 19, 1998 and November 27, 2001.</p>
<p>Lerach Coughlin attorneys moved swiftly to freeze over $1.1 billion in illicit insider trading proceeds. Lerach Coughlin attorneys and investigators interviewed more than 100 witnesses concerning the numerous organizations within Enron, including over 3,000 related entities and partnerships. Lerach Coughlin attorneys sought expedited discovery from both Enron and Enron's auditor, Andersen. Just 24 hours after Andersen revealed it destroyed an untold number of relevant documents concerning the Enron fraud, the attorneys went back to court seeking to preserve all evidence. Lerach Coughlin attorneys' factual investigation also uncovered Enron's extensive document destruction at its Houston headquarters.</p>
<p>The U.S. District Court in Houston has denied a number of motions to dismiss the litigation. The parties are currently engaged in discovery and motion practice; depositions began in the summer of 2004.</p>
<p>Lead Plaintiff, The U.C. Regents, has reached settlements with Lehman Brothers, Bank of America, the Outside Directors, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and CIBC totaling over $7 billion for investors. Those settlements are subject to approval by the Court.</p>

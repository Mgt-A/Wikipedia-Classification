<p>Mark Rothko was born in <a href="/wiki/Dvinsk" title="Dvinsk" class="mw-redirect">Dvinsk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Daugavpils" title="Daugavpils">Daugavpils</a>, <a href="/wiki/Latvia" title="Latvia">Latvia</a>). His father, Jacob, was a <a href="/wiki/Pharmacist" title="Pharmacist">pharmacist</a> and an intellectual, who provided his children with a secular and political, rather than religious, upbringing. Unlike Jews in most cities of <a href="/wiki/Czarist_Russia" title="Czarist Russia" class="mw-redirect">Czarist Russia</a>, those in Dvinsk had been spared from violent outbreak of anti-Semitic pogroms. However, in an environment where Jews were often blamed for many of the evils that befell Russia, Rothko’s early childhood was plagued with fear, as he witnessed the occasional violence brought down upon Jews by <a href="/wiki/Cossack" title="Cossack" class="mw-redirect">Cossacks</a> attempting to stifle revolutionary uprisings.</p>
<p>Despite Jacob Rothkowitz's modest income, the family was highly educated, and able to speak <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yiddish" title="Yiddish" class="mw-redirect">Yiddish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hebrew" title="Hebrew" class="mw-redirect">Hebrew</a>. Following Jacob’s return to Orthodox Judaism, he sent Marcus, his youngest son, to the <a href="/wiki/Cheder" title="Cheder">cheder</a> at age five, where Rothko studied the <a href="/wiki/Talmud" title="Talmud">Talmud</a>. This had the adverse effect of stigmatizing him as an outsider within his own family, since his elders were educated in the public school system. As a Jewish person, the young Marcus was therefore an outsider among outsiders.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Mark_Rothko&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Emigration to the U.S.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Emigration to the U.S.</span></h2>
<p>Fearing that his sons were about to be drafted into the Czarist army, Jacob Rothkowitz decided to <a href="/wiki/Emigrate" title="Emigrate">emigrate</a> to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, following the path of many other Jews who left Daugavpils in the wake of Cossack purges, which had become more severe. These emigres included two of Jacob's brothers, who managed to establish themselves as clothing manufacturers in <a href="/wiki/Portland,_Oregon" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, a common profession among Eastern European immigrants. Marcus remained in Russia with his mother and elder sister Sonia. They joined Jacob and the elder brothers later, arriving at Ellis Island in the winter of 1913 after twelve days at sea. Jacob's death a few months later left the family without economic support. One of Marcus’ great aunts did unskilled labor, Sonia operated a cash register, while Marcus worked in one of his uncle’s warehouses, selling newspapers to employees.</p>
<p>Marcus started school in the United States in 1913, quickly accelerating from third to fifth grade, and completed the secondary level with honors at <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_High_School_(Portland,_Oregon)" title="Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)">Lincoln High School</a> in Portland, in June 1921 at the age of seventeen. He learned his fourth language, English, and became an active member of the Jewish community center, where he proved adept at political discussions. Like his father, Rothko was passionate about such issues as workers’ rights and women's right to contraception. Typical among Jewish liberals, Rothko supported the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" title="Russian Revolution of 1917" class="mw-redirect">Russian Revolution</a> in principle, although this position may be described as decorative, in the sense that he was never politically engaged.</p>
<p>He received a scholarship to <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale</a> based on academic performance, but it has been suggested that Yale only made this offer in order to lure Rothko’s friend, <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Director" title="Aaron Director">Aaron Director</a>, with a similar proposal. After one year, the scholarship ran out and Rothko took menial jobs to support his studies.</p>
<p>Rothko found the <a href="/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant" title="White Anglo-Saxon Protestant">"WASP"</a> Yale community elitist and racist. He and Aaron Director started a satirical magazine, <i>The Yale Saturday Evening Pest</i>, which lampooned the school’s stuffy, bourgeois attitude.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Following his second year, Rothko dropped out, and did not return until he was awarded an honorary degree forty-six years later.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1923, Rothko found employment in the garment district and took up residence on the Upper West Side. It was while visiting a friend at the <a href="/wiki/Art_Students_League_of_New_York" title="Art Students League of New York">Art Students League of New York</a> that he witnessed students sketching a model. According to Rothko, this was the beginning of his life as an artist. He was twenty years old and had taken some art classes in high school, but his initial experience was far from an immediate calling. Even his self-described "beginning" at the <a href="/wiki/Art_Students_League_of_New_York" title="Art Students League of New York">Art Students League of New York</a> is not exactly accurate - two months after he returned to Portland to visit his family, he joined a theater group run by <a href="/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>’s wife, <a href="/wiki/Josephine_Dillon" title="Josephine Dillon">Josephine Dillon</a>. Whatever his theatrical ability may have been, he did not have the appearance typically associated with successful commercial actors, and professional acting seemed an improbable career.</p>
<p>Returning to New York, Rothko enrolled in the New School of Design, where one of his instructors was the artist <a href="/wiki/Arshile_Gorky" title="Arshile Gorky">Arshile Gorky</a>. This was probably his first encounter with a member of the "avant-garde". That autumn, he took courses at the <a href="/wiki/Art_Students_League_of_New_York" title="Art Students League of New York">Art Students League of New York</a> taught by still-life artist <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber_(artist)" title="Max Weber (artist)">Max Weber</a>, who was also a Russian Jew. It was due to Weber that Rothko began to see art as a tool of emotional and religious expression, and Rothko’s paintings from this era portray a Weberian influence.</p>
<p><a name="Rothko.E2.80.99s_circle" id="Rothko.E2.80.99s_circle"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Mark_Rothko&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Rothko’s circle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rothko’s circle</span></h3>
<p>Rothko’s move to New York established him in a fertile atmosphere for the experience of art from all cultures and periods. Modernist painters had shows in the New York galleries, and the city’s museums were an invaluable resource to foster a budding artist’s knowledge, experience and skills. Among those early influences were the works of the German Expressionists, the surrealist work of <a href="/wiki/Paul_Klee" title="Paul Klee">Paul Klee</a>, and the paintings of <a href="/wiki/Georges_Rouault" title="Georges Rouault">Georges Rouault</a>. In 1928, Rothko had his own showing with a group of young artists at the appropriately named <a href="/w/index.php?title=Opportunity_Gallery&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Opportunity Gallery (page does not exist)">Opportunity Gallery</a>. His paintings included dark, moody, expressionist interiors, as well as urban scenes, and were generally well accepted among critics and peers. Despite modest success, Rothko still needed to supplement his income, and in 1929 he began giving classes in painting and clay sculpture at the Center Academy, where he remained as teacher until 1952. During this time, he met <a href="/wiki/Adolph_Gottlieb" title="Adolph Gottlieb">Adolph Gottlieb</a>, who, along with <a href="/wiki/Barnett_Newman" title="Barnett Newman">Barnett Newman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Solman" title="Joseph Solman">Joseph Solman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Schanker" title="Louis Schanker">Louis Schanker</a>, and <a href="/wiki/John_D._Graham" title="John D. Graham">John Graham</a>, was part of a group of young artists surrounding the painter <a href="/wiki/Milton_Avery" title="Milton Avery">Milton Avery</a>, fifteen years Rothko’s senior. Avery’s stylized, natural scenes, utilizing a rich knowledge of form and color, would be a tremendous influence on Rothko. His own paintings, soon after meeting Avery, began to use similar subject matter and color, as in Rothko’s 1933/34 <i>Bathers, or Beach Scene</i>.</p>
<p>Rothko, Gottlieb, Newman, Solman, Graham, and their mentor, Avery, spent considerable time together, vacationing at Lake George and Gloucester, Massachusetts, spending their days painting and their evenings discussing art. During a 1932 visit to Lake George, Rothko met Edith Sachar, a jewelry designer. The two were married on November 12, and maintained, at first, a close and mutually supportive relationship. The following summer, Rothko’s first one-man show was held at the <a href="/wiki/Portland_Art_Museum" title="Portland Art Museum">Portland Art Museum</a>, consisting mostly of drawings and <a href="/wiki/Aquarelle" title="Aquarelle" class="mw-redirect">aquarelles</a>, as well as the works of Rothko’s pre-adolescent students from the Center Academy.

<p>Returning to New York, unhampered by his lack of family support, Rothko had his first East Coast one-man show at the Contemporary Arts Gallery, showing fifteen oil paintings, mostly portraits, along with some aquarelles and drawings. It was the oils that would capture the critics’ eye; Rothko’s use of rich fields of colors showed a master’s touch, and moved beyond the influence of Avery. In late 1935, Rothko joined with <a href="/wiki/Ilya_Bolotowsky" title="Ilya Bolotowsky">Ilya Bolotowsky</a>, Ben-Zion, Adolph Gottlieb, Lou Harris, Ralph Rosenborg, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Schanker" title="Louis Schanker">Louis Schanker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Solman" title="Joseph Solman">Joseph Solman</a> to form "<a href="http://www.LouisSchanker.info/tendisc.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.LouisSchanker.info/tendisc.htm" rel="nofollow">The Ten</a>" (Whitney Ten Dissenters), whose mission (according to a catalog from a 1937 Mercury Gallery show) was "to protest against the reputed equivalence of American painting and literal painting." Rothko's style was already evolving in the direction of his renowned later works, yet, despite this newfound exploration of color, Rothko turned his attention to another formal and stylistic innovation, inaugurating a period of surrealist paintings influenced by mythological fables and symbols. This period can be read as a by-product of Rothko’s growing reputation among his peers, particularly the Artists Union. Begun in 1937, and including Gottlieb and Soloman, their plan was to create a municipal art gallery to show self-organized group exhibitions. The Artists Union was a cooperative which brought together resources and talent of various artists to create an atmosphere of mutual admiration and self-promotion. In 1936, the group had a showing at the Galerie Bonaparte in France. Then, in 1938, a show was held at the Mercury Gallery, in direct defiance of the Whitney Museum, which the group regarded as having a provincial, regionalist agenda. It was also during this period that Rothko, like many artists, found employment with the Works Progress Administration, a labor relief agency created under <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a>’s <a href="/wiki/New_Deal" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> in response to the economic crisis. As the Depression waned, Rothko continued on in government service, working for TRAP, an agency that employed artists, architects and laborers in the restoration and renovation of public buildings. Many other important artists were also employed by TRAP, including Avery, <a href="/wiki/Willem_de_Kooning" title="Willem de Kooning">DeKooning</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" title="Jackson Pollock">Pollock</a>, Reinhardt, <a href="/wiki/David_Smith_(sculptor)" title="David Smith (sculptor)">David Smith</a>, <a href="/wiki/Louise_Berliawsky_Nevelson" title="Louise Berliawsky Nevelson">Louise Nevelson</a>, eight of the "Ten" artists of the dissenter group, and Rothko’s old teacher, Arshile Gorky.</p>

<p>In 1936, Rothko began writing a book, never completed, about similarities in the art of children and the work of modern painters. According to Rothko, the work of modernists, influenced by primitive art, could be compared to that of children in that "child art transforms itself into primitivism, which is only the child producing a mimicry of himself." In this manuscript, he observed that "the fact that one usually begins with drawing is already academic. We start with color."</p>
<p>The modernist artist, like the child and the primitive by whom he is influenced, expresses an innate feeling for form that is, in the best and most universal work, expressed without mental interference. It is a physical and emotional, non-intellectual experience. Rothko was using fields of color in his aquarelles and city scenes, and his subject matter and form at this time had become non-intellectual.</p>
<p>Rothko seemed to have had a revelation, which explains the progression of his later works toward mature, rectangular fields of color and light, that later culminated – or self-destructed – in his final works for the Rothko Chapel. However, between the primitivist and playful urban scenes and aquarelles of the early period, and the late, transcendent fields of color, was a period of transition. It was a rich and complex milieu which included two important events in Rothko’s life: the onset of World War II, and his reading of Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>

<p>Rothko separated from his wife, Edith Sachar, in the summer of 1937, following Edith’s increased success in the jewelry business. Apparently, Rothko did not enjoy working for his wife, and felt both threatened by, and envious of, her financial success. At this time Rothko was, in comparison, a financial failure. He and Sachar reconciled several months later, yet their relationship remained tense. On February 21, 1938, Rothko finally became a citizen of the United States, prompted by fears that the growing Nazi influence in Europe might provoke sudden deportation of American Jews. In a related political development, following the <a href="/wiki/Molotov-Ribbentrop_Pact" title="Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact" class="mw-redirect">Hitler-Stalin Pact</a> of 1939, Rothko, along with Avery, Gottlieb, and others, left the American Artists’ Congress in order to dissociate themselves from the Congress’ alignment with radical Communism. In June, Rothko and a number of other artists formed the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. Their aim was to keep their art free from political propaganda. A rise of Nazi sympathy in the United States heightened Rothko's fears of antisemitism, and in January 1940, he abbreviated his name from "Marcus Rothkowitz" to "Mark Rothko". The name "Roth," a common abbreviation, had become, as a result of its commonality, identifiably Jewish, therefore he settled upon "Rothko".</p>

<p>Fearing that modern American painting had reached a conceptual dead end, Rothko was intent upon exploring subjects other than urban and natural scenes. He sought subjects that would complement his growing concern with form, space, and color. The world crisis of war lent this search an immediacy, because he insisted that the new subject matter be of social impact, yet able to transcend the confines of current political symbols and values. In his essay, "The <a href="/wiki/Romantics" title="Romantics" class="mw-redirect">Romantics</a> Were Prompted," published in 1949, Rothko argued that the "archaic artist … found it necessary to create a group of intermediaries, monsters, hybrids, gods and demigods" in much the same way that modern man found intermediaries in <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party" title="Communist Party" class="mw-redirect">Communist Party</a>. For Rothko, "without monsters and gods, art cannot enact a drama."</p>
<p>Rothko’s use of <a href="/wiki/Mythology" title="Mythology">mythology</a> as a commentary on current history was by no means novel. Rothko, Gottlieb, and Newman read and discussed the works of <a href="/wiki/Freud" title="Freud" class="mw-redirect">Freud</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jung" title="Jung" class="mw-redirect">Jung</a>, in particular their respective theories concerning dreams and the archetypes of the collective unconscious, and understood mythological symbols as images that refer to themselves, operating in a space of human consciousness that transcends specific history and culture. Rothko later said his artistic approach was "reformed" by his study of the "dramatic themes of myth." He apparently stopped painting altogether for the length of 1940, and read Freud’s <i><a href="/wiki/Interpretation_of_Dreams" title="Interpretation of Dreams" class="mw-redirect">Interpretation of Dreams</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Sir_James_Frazer" title="Sir James Frazer" class="mw-redirect">Frazer</a>’s <i><a href="/wiki/Golden_Bough" title="Golden Bough" class="mw-redirect">Golden Bough</a></i>.</p>

<p>Rothko’s new vision would attempt to address modern man’s spiritual and creative mythological requirements. The most crucial philosophical influence on Rothko in this period was <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>’s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Birth_of_Tragedy" title="The Birth of Tragedy">The Birth of Tragedy</a></i>. Nietzsche claimed that Greek tragedy had the function of the redemption of man from the terrors of mortal life. The exploration of novel topics in modern art ceased to be Rothko’s goal; from this point on, his art would bear the ultimate aim of relieving modern man’s spiritual emptiness. He believed that this "emptiness" was created partly by the lack of a mythology, which could, as described by Nietzsche,"[address]... the growth of a child’s mind and - to a mature man his life and struggles".</p>
<p>Rothko believed the task for his art would be to provide the aesthetic recognition necessary for the freeing of those unconscious energies previously liberated by mythological images, symbols, and rituals. He considered himself a "mythmaker," and proclaimed that the only valid subject matter is that which is tragic. "The exhilarated tragic experience," he wrote, "is for me the only source of art."</p>
<p>Many of his paintings of this period contrast barbaric scenes of violence with those of civilized passivity, with imagery drawn primarily from <a href="/wiki/Aeschylus" title="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>’ <a href="/wiki/The_Oresteia" title="The Oresteia" class="mw-redirect">Oresteia trilogy</a>. In his 1942 painting, <i>Omens of the Eagle</i>, the archetypal images of, in Rothko’s words, "man, bird, beast and tree … merge into a single tragic idea." The bird, an eagle, was not without contemporary historical relevance, as both the United States and Germany (in its claim to inheritance of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>) used the eagle as a national symbol. Rothko’s cross-cultural, trans-historical reading of myth perfectly addresses the psychological and emotional roots of the symbol, making it universally available to anyone who might wish to see it. A list of the titles of the paintings from this period is illustrative of Rothko’s use of myth: <i><a href="/wiki/Antigone" title="Antigone">Antigone</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Oedipus" title="Oedipus">Oedipus</a></i>, <i>The Sacrifice of <a href="/wiki/Iphigenia" title="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Leda_(mythology)" title="Leda (mythology)">Leda</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Erinyes" title="Erinyes">The Furies</a></i>, <i>Altar of <a href="/wiki/Orpheus" title="Orpheus">Orpheus</a></i>. Judeo-Christian imagery is evoked: <i>Gethsemane</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Last_Supper" title="The Last Supper" class="mw-redirect">The Last Supper</a></i>, <i>Rites of <a href="/wiki/Lilith" title="Lilith">Lilith</a></i>, as are Egyptian (<i>Room in <a href="/wiki/Karnak" title="Karnak">Karnak</a></i>) and Syrian (<i>The Syrian Bull</i>). Soon after the war, Rothko felt his titles were limiting the larger, transcendent aims of his paintings, and so removed them altogether.</p>

<p>At the root of Rothko and Gottlieb’s presentation of archaic forms and symbols as subject matter illuminating modern existence had been the influence of <a href="/wiki/Surrealism" title="Surrealism">Surrealism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cubism" title="Cubism">Cubism</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Abstract_art" title="Abstract art">abstract art</a>. In 1936, Rothko attended two exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, "Cubism and Abstract Art," and "Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism.", which greatly influenced his celebrated 1938 <i>Subway Scene</i>.</p>
<p>In 1942, following the success of shows by <a href="/wiki/Max_Ernst" title="Max Ernst">Ernst</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3" title="Joan Miró">Miró</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yves_Tanguy" title="Yves Tanguy">Tanguy</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD" title="Salvador Dalí">Salvador Dalí</a>, who had immigrated to the United States because of the war, <a href="/wiki/Surrealism" title="Surrealism">Surrealism</a> took New York by storm. Rothko and his peers, <a href="/wiki/Adolph_Gottlieb" title="Adolph Gottlieb">Gottlieb</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barnett_Newman" title="Barnett Newman">Newman</a>, met and discussed art and ideas with these European pioneers, especially with <a href="/wiki/Piet_Mondrian" title="Piet Mondrian">Mondrian</a>. They began to regard themselves as heirs to the European avant-garde.</p>
<p>Their program, of which the new experiments with mythic form were the catalyst, would be to merge the two European styles of Surrealism and abstraction. As a result, Rothko’s work became increasingly abstract; perhaps ironically, Rothko himself described the process as being one toward "clarity." In the Museum of Modern Art, he became fascinated by <a href="/wiki/Henri_Matisse" title="Henri Matisse">Matisse</a>’s <i>Red Room</i>, later attributing to it the source of inspiration for his later abstract paintings.</p>
<p>New paintings were unveiled at a 1942 show at <a href="/wiki/Macy%E2%80%99s" title="Macy’s" class="mw-redirect">Macy’s</a> department store in New York City. In response to a negative review by the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times" class="mw-redirect">New York Times</a></i>, Rothko and Gottlieb issued a manifesto (written mainly by Rothko) which stated, in response to the <i>Times</i> critic’s self-professed "befuddlement" over the new work,</p>

<p>Rothko's vision of <a href="/wiki/Myth" title="Myth" class="mw-redirect">myth</a> as a replenishing resource for an era of spiritual void had been set in motion decades before, by his reading of <a href="/wiki/Carl_Jung" title="Carl Jung">Carl Jung</a>, <a href="/wiki/T._S._Eliot" title="T.

Unlike his predecessors, Rothko would, in his later period, develop his philosophy of the tragic ideal into the realm of pure abstraction. He thereby questioned the possibility for mankind to transform a cradle of imagery into a new set of images, no longer dependent on tribal, archaic, and religious mythologies – the very symbols Rothko had utilized and struggled with during his middle period.</p>

<p>On June 13, 1943, Rothko and Sachar separated again. Rothko suffered a long depression following their divorce. Thinking that a change of scenery might help, Rothko returned to Portland. From there he traveled to Berkeley, where he met artist <a href="/wiki/Clyfford_Still" title="Clyfford Still">Clyfford Still</a>, and the two began a close friendship. Still’s deeply abstract paintings would be of considerable influence on Rothko’s later works. In the autumn of 1943, Rothko returned to New York, where he met noted collector <a href="/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim" title="Peggy Guggenheim">Peggy Guggenheim</a>. Her assistant, Howard Putzel, convinced Guggenheim to show Rothko in her <a href="/wiki/The_Art_of_This_Century_Gallery" title="The Art of This Century Gallery">The Art of This Century Gallery</a>. In 1944, photographer <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Siskind" title="Aaron Siskind">Aaron Siskind</a> introduced Rothko to Mary Alice Beistle, a twenty-three-year-old illustrator of children’s books, and the two fell in love and were married in the spring of 1945. The marriage was considerably happier than Rothko’s first marriage had been. Rothko’s one-man show at the Guggenheim, in late 1945, resulted in few sales (prices ranging from $150 to $750), and in less-than-favorable reviews. He sensed that his art was becoming passé among the intended audience and no longer a viable medium, and at the same time had been stimulated by Still’s abstract landscapes of color. Therefore, at this time, Rothko broke with the Surrealists, explaining:</p>

<p>Rothko could no longer bring himself to continue interpreting the unconscious symbolism of everyday forms. The experiment had run its course. His future lay with abstraction; in it, Rothko found release from the Surrealist program of the humanist impulse of "memory and hallucination." His 1945 masterpiece, "Slow Swirl at Edge of Sea" magnificently illustrates Rothko’s newfound propensity towards abstraction. Sometimes interpreted as a meditation on Rothko’s courtship of his second wife, the painting presents two humanlike forms embraced in a swirling, floating atmosphere of shapes and colors, in subtle grays and browns. The rigid rectangular background foreshadows Rothko’s later experiments in pure color. The painting was completed, not coincidentally, in the year the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War" class="mw-redirect">Second World War</a> ended.</p>
<p>Despite the abandonment of his "Mythomorphic Abstractionism" (as described by <a href="/wiki/ARTnews" title="ARTnews">ARTnews</a>), Rothko would still recognized by the public primarily for his "Surrealist" works, for the remainder of the 1940s. The <a href="/wiki/Whitney_Museum" title="Whitney Museum" class="mw-redirect">Whitney Museum</a> included them in their annual exhibit of Contemporary Art from 1943 to 1950.</p>

<p>The year 1946 saw the creation of Rothko’s new "multiform" paintings. In viewing the <a href="/wiki/Catalogue_raisonn%C3%A9" title="Catalogue raisonné">catalogue raisonné</a>, one can recognize the gradual metamorphosis from surrealistic, myth-influenced paintings of the early part of the decade to the highly abstract, <a href="/wiki/Clyfford_Still" title="Clyfford Still">Clyfford Still</a>-influenced forms of pure color. The term "multiform" has been applied by art critics; this word was never used by Rothko himself, yet it is an accurate description of these paintings. Several of them, including No. 18 (1948) and Untitled (also 1948), are masterpieces in their own right. Rothko himself described these paintings as possessing a more organic structure, and as self-contained units of human expression. For Rothko, these blurred blocks of various colors, devoid of landscape or human figure, let alone myth and symbol, possessed their own life force. They contained a "breath of life" he found lacking in most figurative painting of the era. This new form seemed filled with possibility, whereas his experimentation with mythological symbolism had become a tired formula, in much the same way as he viewed his late 1930’s experiments in urban settings. The "multiforms" brought Rothko to a realization of his mature, signature style, and was the only style Rothko would never fully abandon prior to his death.</p>
<p>Rothko, in the middle of a crucial period of transition, had been impressed by Clyfford Still’s abstract fields of color, which were influenced in part by the landscapes of Still’s native North Dakota. In 1947, during a subsequent semester teaching at the California School of Fine Art, Rothko and Still flirted with the idea of founding their own curriculum, and they realized the idea in New York in the following year. Named "The Subjects of the Artists School," they employed <a href="/wiki/David_Hare_(artist)" title="David Hare (artist)">David Hare</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Motherwell" title="Robert Motherwell">Robert Motherwell</a>, among others. Though the group was short-lived and separated later in the same year, the school was the center of a flurry of activity in contemporary art. In addition to his teaching experience, Rothko began to contribute articles to two new art publications, "Tiger’s Eye" and "Possibilities". Using the forums as an opportunity to assess the current art scene, Rothko also discussed in detail his own artwork and philosophy of art. These articles reflect the elimination of figurative elements from his work. He described his new method as "unknown adventures in an unknown space," free from "direct association with any particular, and the passion of organism."</p>

<p>It was not long before the "multiforms" developed into the signature style; by early 1949 Rothko exhibited these new works at the <a href="/wiki/Betty_Parsons" title="Betty Parsons">Betty Parsons</a> Gallery. For critic <a href="/wiki/Harold_Rosenberg" title="Harold Rosenberg">Harold Rosenberg</a>, the paintings were nothing short of a revelation. Rothko had, after painting his first "multiform," secluded himself to his home in <a href="/wiki/East_Hampton" title="East Hampton">East Hampton</a> on <a href="/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>. He invited only a select few, including Rosenberg, to view the new paintings. The discovery of his definitive form came at a period of great distress to the artist; his mother Kate died in October 1948. It was at some point during that winter that Rothko happened upon the striking symmetrical rectangular blocks of two to three opposing or contrasting, yet complementary, colors. Additionally, for the next seven years, Rothko painted in oil only on large canvases with vertical formats. Very large-scale designs were used in order to overwhelm the viewer, or, in Rothko’s words, to make the viewer feel "enveloped within" the painting. For some critics, the large size was an attempt to make up for a lack of substance. In retaliation, Rothko stated:</p>
<table style="margin:auto; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;" class="cquote">

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">I realize that historically the function of painting large pictures is painting something very grandiose and pompous.

<p>He even went so far as to recommend that a viewer position themselves as little as 18 inches away from the canvas<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> so that the viewer might experience a sense of intimacy, as well as awe, a transcendence of the individual, and a sense of the unknown.</p>
<p>Again, Rothko’s aims, in some critics’ and viewers’ estimation, exceeded his methods. Many of the <a href="/wiki/Abstract_expressionist" title="Abstract expressionist" class="mw-redirect">abstract expressionists</a> exhibited pretensions for something approximating a <a href="/wiki/Spirituality" title="Spirituality">spiritual</a> experience, or at least an experience that exceeded the boundaries of the purely aesthetic. In later years, Rothko would do much to promote this spiritual aspect of his artwork, a sentiment that would culminate in the construction of the <a href="/wiki/Rothko_Chapel" title="Rothko Chapel">Rothko Chapel</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the "multiforms" and early signature paintings display an affinity for bright, vibrant colors, particularly reds and yellows, expressing energy and ecstasy. By the mid 1950’s however, close to a decade before the completion of the first "multiforms," Rothko began to employ dark blues and greens; for many critics of his work this shift in colors was representative of a growing darkness within Rothko’s personal life.</p>
<p>The general method for these paintings was to apply a thin layer of binder mixed with pigment directly onto uncoated and untreated canvas, and to paint significantly thinned oils directly onto this layer, creating a dense mixture of overlapping colors and shapes. His brush strokes were fast and light, a method he would continue to use until his death. His increasing adeptness at this method is apparent in the paintings completed for the Chapel. With a total lack of figurative representation, what drama there is to be found in a late Rothko is in the contrast of colors, radiating, as it were, against one another. His paintings can then be likened to a sort of fugal arrangement: each variation counterpoised against one another, yet all existing within one architectonic structure.</p>
<p>Rothko used several original techniques that he tried to keep secret even from his assistants. <a href="/wiki/Electron_microscopy" title="Electron microscopy" class="mw-redirect">Electron microscopy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> analysis conducted by the MOLAB showed that he employed natural substances such as egg and glue, as well as artificial materials including <a href="/wiki/Acrylic_resins" title="Acrylic resins" class="mw-redirect">acrylic resins</a>, <a href="/wiki/Phenol_formaldehyde" title="Phenol formaldehyde" class="mw-redirect">phenol formaldehyde</a>, modified <a href="/wiki/Alkyd" title="Alkyd">alkyd</a>, and others <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup>. One of his objectives was to make the various layers of the painting dry quickly, without mixing of colors, such that he could soon create new layers on top of the earlier ones.</p>

<p>Rothko and his wife visited Europe for five months in early 1950. The last time he had been in Europe was during his childhood in Latvia, at that time part of Russia. Yet he did not return to his motherland, preferring to visit the important museums of <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> and <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>. He much admired European art, and he visited the major museums of <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Besides viewing many paintings, the architecture and the music of Europe left a deep impression on Rothko. The <a href="/wiki/Fresco" title="Fresco">frescoes</a> of <a href="/wiki/Fra_Angelico" title="Fra Angelico">Fra Angelico</a> in the monastery of <a href="/wiki/San_Marco" title="San Marco">San Marco</a> at <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a> most impressed him. Angelico’s intimately bright tempera frescoes magnificently contrast with the grandeur and monastic serenity of the surrounding architecture. Certainly the spirituality and concentration on light appealed to Rothko’s sensibilities, as did Angelico’s economic circumstances, which Rothko saw as similar to his own, having always been forced to struggle to exist as an artist.</p>
<p>Of Angelico, Rothko stated "As an artist you have to be a thief and steal a place for yourself on the rich man’s wall." He felt he was still struggling, despite some promising developments, including the sale of a painting for one thousand dollars to <a href="/wiki/Blanchette_Ferry_Rockefeller" title="Blanchette Ferry Rockefeller">Mrs. John D. Rockefeller III</a> and the purchase of "Number 10" (1950) for the <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>.</p>
<p>Rothko had one-man shows at the Betty Parson Gallery in 1950 and 1951, and at other galleries across the world, including <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo" title="São Paulo">São Paulo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. The 1952 "Fifteen Americans" show curated by <a href="/wiki/Dorothy_Canning_Miller" title="Dorothy Canning Miller">Dorothy Canning Miller</a> at the Museum of Modern Art formally heralded the abstract artists, including works by <a href="/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" title="Jackson Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_Baziotes" title="William Baziotes">William Baziotes</a>. It also created a dispute between Rothko and Barnett Newman, after Newman accused Rothko of having attempted to exclude him from the show. Growing success as a group led to infighting, and claims to supremacy and leadership. When "Fortune" magazine named a Rothko painting as a good investment, Newman and Still, out of jealousy, branded him a sell-out, secretly possessing bourgeois aspirations. Still wrote to Rothko to request the paintings he had given Rothko over the years. Rothko was deeply depressed by his former friends’ jealousy.</p>
<p>While in Rome, his wife, nicknamed "Mell", discovered that she was pregnant and on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="12-30"><a href="/wiki/December_30" title="December 30">December 30</a></span>, she gave birth to a daughter, Kathy Lynn, whom the parents called "Kate" in honor of Rothko’s mother.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, due to the Fortune magazine plug and further purchases by legitimate clients, Rothko’s financial situation began to improve. In addition to sales of paintings, he also had money from his teaching position at <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn_College" title="Brooklyn College">Brooklyn College</a>. In 1954, he exhibited in a solo show at the <a href="/wiki/Art_Institute_of_Chicago" title="Art Institute of Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>, where he met art dealer <a href="/wiki/Sidney_Janis" title="Sidney Janis">Sidney Janis</a>, who also represented Pollock and <a href="/wiki/Franz_Kline" title="Franz Kline">Franz Kline</a>. Their relationship proved mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Despite his fame, Rothko felt a growing personal seclusion, and a sense of being misunderstood as an artist. He feared that people purchased his paintings simply out of fashion, and that the true purpose of his work was not being grasped by collectors, audiences or critics. He wanted his paintings to move beyond abstraction, as well as beyond classical art. For Rothko, the paintings were objects that possessed their own form and potential, and therefore, must be encountered as such. Sensing the futility of words in describing this decidedly non-verbal aspect of his work, Rothko abandoned all attempts at responding to those that might inquire after its meaning and purpose, stating finally that silence is "so accurate." His paintings’ "surfaces are expansive and push outward in all directions, or their surfaces contract and rush inward in all directions. Between these two poles you can find everything I want to say."</p>
<p>He began to insist that he was not an <a href="/wiki/Abstractionist" title="Abstractionist" class="mw-redirect">abstractionist</a>, and that such a description was as inaccurate as labeling him a great colorist. His interest was:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">only in expressing basic human emotions — tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on. And the fact that a lot of people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures shows that I can communicate those basic human emotions . . . The people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when I painted them. And if you, as you say, are moved only by their color relationship, then you miss the point.</td>
<td width="20" valign="bottom" style="color:#B2B7F2;font-size:36px;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:10px 10px;">”</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>For Rothko, color is "merely an instrument." The "multiforms" and the signature paintings are, in essence, the same expression of "basic human emotions," as his surrealistic mythological paintings, albeit in a more pure form. What is common among these stylistic innovations is a concern for "tragedy, ecstasy and doom." Rothko’s comment on viewers breaking down in tears before his paintings that may have convinced the <a href="/wiki/Dominique_de_Menil" title="Dominique de Menil" class="mw-redirect">De Menils</a> to construct the Rothko Chapel. Whatever Rothko’s feeling about the audience or the critical establishment’s interpretation of his work, it is apparent that, by 1958, the spiritual expression he meant to portray on canvas was growing increasingly dark. His bright reds, yellows and oranges were subtly transformed into dark blues, greens, grays and blacks.</p>

<p>In 1958, Rothko was awarded the first of two major mural commissions that proved both rewarding and frustrating. The beverage company <a href="/wiki/Seagram" title="Seagram">Joseph Seagram and Sons</a> had recently completed their new building on Park Avenue, designed by architects <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe" title="Ludwig Mies van der Rohe">Mies Van der Rohe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Philip_Johnson" title="Philip Johnson">Philip Johnson</a>. Rothko agreed to provide wall paintings for the building’s restaurant, <a href="/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant" title="The Four Seasons Restaurant">The Four Seasons</a>. This was the first time he was required not only to design a series of paintings, but to produce artwork for a specific space. Over the following three months, Rothko completed forty paintings, three full series in dark red and brown. He altered his horizontal format to vertical to complement the restaurant’s vertical features: columns, walls, doors and windows.</p>
<p>The following June, Rothko and his family again traveled to Europe. While on the <a href="/wiki/SS_Independence" title="SS Independence">SS Independence</a> he disclosed to <a href="/wiki/John_Fischer" title="John Fischer">John Fischer</a>, publisher of <a href="/wiki/Harper%27s_Magazine" title="Harper's Magazine">Harper's</a>, that his true intention for the Seagram murals was to paint "something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room. If the restaurant would refuse to put up my murals, that would be the ultimate compliment. But they won’t. People can stand anything these days."</p>
<p>While in Europe, the Rothkos traveled to Rome, <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pompeii" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>. In Florence, he visited the library at San Lorenzo, to see first-hand the library’s <a href="/wiki/Michelangelo" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> room, from which he drew further inspiration for the murals. He remarked that the "room had exactly the feeling that I wanted [...] it gives the visitor the feeling of being caught in a room with the doors and windows walled-in shut." Following the trip to Italy, the Rothkos voyaged to <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <a href="/wiki/Antwerp" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, before returning to the United States. Once back in New York, Rothko and Mell visited the Four Seasons. Upset by the restaurant’s pretentious atmosphere, Rothko abandoned the project on the spot, deciding to return his advance to Seagram and Sons, and to keep the paintings for himself. (The final series of <i>Seagram Murals</i> was dispersed and now hangs in three locations: London’s <a href="/wiki/Tate_Modern" title="Tate Modern">Tate Modern</a>, Japan’s <a href="/w/index.php?title=Kawamura_Memorial_Museum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kawamura Memorial Museum (page does not exist)">Kawamura Memorial Museum</a> and the <a href="/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Art" title="National Gallery of Art">National Gallery of Art</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>) <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Rothko’s first completed space was created in the <a href="/wiki/Phillips_Collection" title="Phillips Collection" class="mw-redirect">Phillips Collection</a> in Washington, D.C., following the purchase of four paintings by collector <a href="/w/index.php?title=Duncan_Phillips_(art_collector)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Duncan Phillips (art collector) (page does not exist)">Duncan Phillips</a>. Rothko’s fame and wealth had substantially increased; his paintings began to sell to notable collectors, including the <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller" title="Rockefeller">Rockefellers</a>. In January 1961, Rothko sat next to <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Kennedy" title="Joseph Kennedy" class="mw-redirect">Joseph Kennedy</a> at <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>’s inaugural ball. Later that year, a retrospective of his work was held at the Museum of Modern Art, to considerable commercial and critical success. In spite of this newfound notoriety, the art world had already turned its attention from the now passé abstract expressionists to the "next big thing", <a href="/wiki/Pop_Art" title="Pop Art" class="mw-redirect">Pop Art</a>, particularly the work of <a href="/wiki/Andy_Warhol" title="Andy Warhol">Warhol</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein" title="Roy Lichtenstein">Lichtenstein</a>, and <a href="/wiki/James_Rosenquist" title="James Rosenquist">Rosenquist</a>.</p>
<p>Rothko labeled Pop-Art artists "charlatans and young opportunists", and wondered aloud during a 1962 exhibition of Pop Art, "are the young artists plotting to kill us all?" On viewing <a href="/wiki/Jasper_Johns" title="Jasper Johns">Jasper Johns</a>' flags, Rothko said, "we worked for years to get rid of all that." It was not that Rothko could not accept being replaced, so much as an inability to accept what was replacing him. He found it valueless, though it received much admiration as collectors sold off their Rothkos, Newmans and Gottliebs and replaced them with <a href="/wiki/Rauschenberg" title="Rauschenberg" class="mw-redirect">Rauschenbergs</a>, and staged retrospectives of artists then in their mid-twenties.</p>
<p>Rothko received a second mural commission project, this time a wall of paintings for the penthouse of Harvard University’s <a href="/w/index.php?title=Holyoke_Center&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Holyoke Center (page does not exist)">Holyoke Center</a>. He made twenty-two sketches, from which five murals were completed - a triptych and two wall paintings. Harvard President <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Pusey" title="Nathan Pusey" class="mw-redirect">Nathan Pusey</a>, following an explanation of the religious symbology of the <a href="/wiki/Triptych" title="Triptych">Triptych</a>, had the paintings hung in January 1963, and later shown at the <a href="/wiki/Guggenheim" title="Guggenheim">Guggenheim</a>. During installation, Rothko found the paintings to be compromised by the room’s lighting. Despite the installation of fiberglass shades, the paintings were removed and, having been weakened by sunlight, were stored in a dark room.

That autumn, Rothko signed with the Marlborough Gallery for sales of his work outside the United States.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Mark_Rothko&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18" title="Edit section: The Chapel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Chapel</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Rothko_Chapel" title="Rothko Chapel">Rothko Chapel</a> is located adjacent to the <a href="/wiki/Menil_Collection" title="Menil Collection">Menil Collection</a> and The University of St. Thomas in <a href="/wiki/Houston,_Texas" title="Houston, Texas" class="mw-redirect">Houston, Texas</a>. The building is small, windowless, and unassuming. It is a geometric, "postmodern" structure, located in a turn-of-the-century middle-class Houston neighborhood. The Chapel, the Menil Collection, and the nearby <a href="/wiki/Cy_Twombly" title="Cy Twombly">Cy Twombly</a> gallery were funded by Texas oil millionaires <a href="/wiki/Dominique_de_Menil" title="Dominique de Menil" class="mw-redirect">John and Dominique de Menil</a>.</p>
<p>In 1964, Rothko moved into his last New York studio at 157 East 69th Street, equipping the studio with pulleys carrying large walls of canvas material to regulate light from a central cupola, to simulate lighting he planned for the Rothko Chapel. Despite warnings about the difference in light between New York and Texas, Rothko persisted with the experiment, setting to work on the canvases. Rothko told friends he intended the Chapel to be his single most important artistic statement. He became considerably involved in the layout of the building, insisting that it feature a central cupola like that of his studio. Architect <a href="/wiki/Philip_Johnson" title="Philip Johnson">Philip Johnson</a>, unable to compromise with Rothko’s vision, left the project in 1967, and was replaced with <a href="/w/index.php?title=Howard_Barnstone&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Howard Barnstone (page does not exist)">Howard Barnstone</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Eugene_Aubry&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Eugene Aubry (page does not exist)">Eugene Aubry</a>. The architects frequently flew to New York to consult, and on one occasion brought with them a miniature of the building for Rothko's approval.</p>
<p>For Rothko, the Chapel was to be a destination, a place of pilgrimage far from the center of art (in this case, New York) where seekers of Rothko’s newly "religious" artwork could journey. This implied an already sympathetic audience in an increasingly indifferent postmodernist art market. Initially, the Chapel, now non-denominational, was to be specifically <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic" class="mw-redirect">Roman Catholic</a>, and during the first three years of the project (1964-67) Rothko believed it would remain so. Thus Rothko’s design of the building and the religious implications of the paintings were inspired by Roman Catholic art and architecture. Its octagonal shape is based on the <a href="/wiki/Byzantine" title="Byzantine" class="mw-redirect">Byzantine</a> church of <a href="/w/index.php?title=St._Maria_Assunta&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="St. Maria Assunta (page does not exist)">St. Maria Assunta</a>, and the format of the triptychs is based on paintings of the <a href="/wiki/Crucifixion" title="Crucifixion">Crucifixion</a>.</p>
<p>It was an odd commission for a secular Jew. However, the De Menils believed the universal "spiritual" aspect of Rothko’s work would complement the elements of Roman Catholicism. Rothko’s willingness may have been related to a sense of persecution he felt from the art world, in the years up to and including the Chapel. What is clear is that the Chapel paintings are the nadir of "darkness and impenetrability" that viewers increasingly encountered in his work in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s.</p>
<p>Rothko’s painting technique required considerable physical stamina that the ailing artist was no longer able to muster. To create the paintings he envisioned, Rothko was forced to hire two assistants to apply the chestnut-brown paint in quick strokes of several layers: "brick reds, deep reds, black mauves." On half of the works, Rothko applied none of the paint himself, and was for the most part content to supervise the slow, arduous process. He felt the completion of the paintings to be "torment" and the inevitable result was to create "something you don’t want to look at."</p>
<p>The Chapel is the culmination of six years of Rothko’s life and represents his gradually growing concern for the transcendent. For some, to witness these paintings is to submit one’s self to a spiritual experience, which, through its transcendence of subject matter, approximates that of consciousness itself. It forces one to approach the limits of experience and awakens one to the awareness of one’s own existence. For others, the Chapel houses 14 large paintings whose dark, nearly impenetrable surfaces represent hermeticism and self-absorption.</p>
<p>The Chapel paintings consist of a monochrome triptych in soft brown on the central wall (three 5-by-15-foot panels), and a pair of triptychs on the left and right made of opaque black rectangles. Between the triptychs are four individual paintings (11 by 15 feet each), and one additional individual painting faces the central triptych from the opposite wall. The effect is to surround the viewer with massive, imposing visions of darkness. Despite its basis in religious symbolism (the triptych) and less-than-subtle imagery (the crucifixion), the paintings are difficult to attach specifically to traditional Christian symbolism, and may act on the viewers subliminally. Active spiritual or aesthetic inquiry may be elicited from the viewer in the same way as a religious icon having specific symbolism. In this way, Rothko’s erasure of symbols both removes and creates barriers to the work.</p>
<p>As it turned out, these works would make up his final artistic statement to the world when they were finally unveiled at the Chapel’s opening in 1971. Rothko never saw the completed Chapel and never installed the paintings. On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1971-02-28"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="02-28"><a href="/wiki/February_28" title="February 28">February 28</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1971" title="1971">1971</a></span>, at the dedication, Dominique De Menil said of the paintings: "We are cluttered with images and only abstract art can bring us to the threshold of the divine", noting Rothko’s courage in painting what might be called "impenetrable fortresses" of color. The drama for many critics of Rothko’s work is the uneasy position of the paintings between, as Chase notes, "nothingness or vapidity" and "dignified ‘mute icons’ offering ‘the only kind of beauty we find acceptable today’."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1968, Rothko suffered an aneurysm of the <a href="/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm" title="Aortic aneurysm">aorta</a>, a result of his chronic high blood pressure. Ignoring doctor’s orders, Rothko continued to drink and smoke heavily, avoided exercise, and maintained an unhealthy diet. However, he did follow the advice not to paint pictures larger than a yard in height, and turned his attention to smaller, less physically strenuous formats, including acrylics on paper. Meanwhile, Rothko's marriage had become increasingly troubled, and his poor health and impotence resulting from the aneurysm compounded his feeling of estrangement in the relationship. Rothko and his wife Mell separated on New Year’s Day 1969, and he moved into his studio.</p>
<p>On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1970-02-25"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="02-25"><a href="/wiki/February_25" title="February 25">February 25</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1970" title="1970">1970</a></span>, Oliver Steindecker, Rothko’s assistant, found the artist in his kitchen, lying dead on the floor in front of the sink, covered in blood. He had sliced his arms with a razor found lying at his side. During autopsy it was discovered he had also overdosed on anti-depressants. He was 66 years old.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, Rothko and his financial advisor, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bernard_Reis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bernard Reis (page does not exist)">Bernard Reis</a>, had created a foundation intended to fund "research and education" that would receive the bulk of Rothko’s work following his death.

In 1971, Rothko’s children filed a lawsuit against Reis, Morton Levine, and <a href="/wiki/Theodoros_Stamos" title="Theodoros Stamos">Theodore Stamos</a>, the executors of his estate. The suit continued for more than 10 years. In 1975, the defendants were found liable for negligence and conflict of interest, removed as executors, and, along with Marlborough Gallery, required to pay a $9.2 million award.

<li>"Since my pictures are large, colorful and unframed, and since museum walls are usually immense and formidable, there is the danger that the pictures relate themselves as decorative areas to the walls. This would be a distortion of their meaning, since the pictures are intimate and intense, and are the opposite of what is decorative."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The fact that people break down and cry when confronted with my pictures shows that I can communicate those basic human emotions.. the people who weep before my pictures are having the same religious experience I had when painting them. And if you say you are moved only by their color relationships then you miss the point."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the June 13, 1943 edition of the New York Times, Rothko, together with <a href="/wiki/Adolph_Gottlieb" title="Adolph Gottlieb">Adolph Gottlieb</a> and <a href="/wiki/Barnett_Newman" title="Barnett Newman">Barnett Newman</a>, published the following brief manifesto:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"1. To us art is an adventure into an unknown world, which can be explored only by those willing to take the risks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"2. This world of imagination is fancy-free and violently opposed to common sense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"3. It is our function as artists to make the spectator see the world our way not his way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"4. We favor the simple expression of the complex thought. We are for the large shape because it has the impact of the unequivocal. We wish to reassert the picture plane. We are for flat forms because they destroy illusion and reveal truth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"5. It is a widely accepted notion among painters that it does not matter what one paints as long as it is well painted."</dd>
<dd>[Rothko said "this is the essence of academicism".]</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"There is no such thing as a good painting about nothing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"We assert that the subject is crucial and only that subject matter is valid which is tragic and timeless. That is why we profess spiritual kinship with primitive and archaic art."</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Silence is so accurate."</li>
</ul>

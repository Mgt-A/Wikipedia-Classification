His subject matter included: psychological revolution, the nature of the mind, <a href="/wiki/Meditation" title="Meditation">meditation</a>, human <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/relationship" class="extiw" title="wikt:relationship">relationships</a>, and how to enact <a href="/wiki/Social_change" title="Social change">positive change</a> in <a href="/wiki/Society" title="Society">society</a>. He constantly stressed the need for a revolution in the psyche of every human being and emphasized that such a revolution cannot be brought about by any external entity whether religious, political or social.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti was born into a <a href="/wiki/Telugu_people" title="Telugu people">Telugu</a> <a href="/wiki/Brahmin" title="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> family in what was then colonial <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>.

He was subsequently raised under the tutelage of <a href="/wiki/Annie_Besant" title="Annie Besant">Annie Besant</a> and C.W. Leadbeater, leaders of the Society at the time, who believed him to be a "vehicle" for an expected <a href="/wiki/World_Teacher" title="World Teacher" class="mw-redirect">World Teacher</a>. As a young man, he disavowed this idea and dissolved the worldwide organization (the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East" title="Order of the Star in the East">Order of the Star</a>) established to support it. He claimed allegiance to no nationality, caste, religion, or philosophy, and spent the rest of his life traveling the world as an individual speaker, speaking to large and small groups, as well as with interested individuals. He authored a number of books, among them <i><a href="/wiki/The_First_and_Last_Freedom" title="The First and Last Freedom">The First and Last Freedom</a></i>, <i>The Only Revolution</i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Krishnamurti%27s_Notebook" title="Krishnamurti's Notebook">Krishnamurti's Notebook</a></i>.

At age 90, he addressed the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> on the subject of peace and <a href="/wiki/Awareness" title="Awareness">awareness</a>, and was awarded the 1984 UN Peace Medal. His last public talk was in Madras, India, in January 1986, a month before his death at home in <a href="/wiki/Ojai,_California" title="Ojai, California">Ojai</a>, California.</p>
<p>His supporters, working through several <a href="/wiki/Non-profit_organization" title="Non-profit organization">non-profit</a> foundations, oversee a number of independent schools centered on his views on education – in India, <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and the United States – and continue to transcribe and distribute many of his thousands of talks, group and individual discussions, and other writings, publishing them in a variety of formats including print, audio, video and digital formats as well as online, in many languages.</p>

<p>Jiddu<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Krishnamurti came from a family of <a href="/wiki/Telugu_language" title="Telugu language">Telugu</a>-speaking <a href="/wiki/Brahmin" title="Brahmin">Brahmins</a>. His father, Narianiah Jiddu, was employed as an official of the then colonial British administration. Krishnamurti was very fond of his mother, Sanjeevamma, who died when he was ten.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> His parents were second cousins, having a total of eleven children, only six of whom survived childhood. They were strict <a href="/wiki/Vegetarian" title="Vegetarian" class="mw-redirect">vegetarians</a>, and were known to throw away any food that the <i>"shadow of an Englishman had crossed"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>He was born on May 12, 1895<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> in the small town of <a href="/wiki/Madanapalle" title="Madanapalle">Madanapalle</a> in <a href="/wiki/Chittoor_District" title="Chittoor District" class="mw-redirect">Chittoor District</a> in <a href="/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh" title="Andhra Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. As the eighth child, who happened to be a boy, he was, in accordance with common Hindu practice, named after Sri <a href="/wiki/Krishna" title="Krishna">Krishna</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1903, the family settled in <a href="/wiki/Cudappah" title="Cudappah" class="mw-redirect">Cudappah</a>, where Krishnamurti during a previous stay had contracted <a href="/wiki/Malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, a disease with which he would suffer recurrent bouts over many years. He was a sensitive and sickly child; <i>"vague and dreamy"</i>, he was often taken to be mentally retarded, and was beaten regularly at school by his teachers and at home by his father.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Several decades later, Krishnamurti reminisced about his state of mind during childhood: <i>"No thought entered his mind. He was watching and listening and nothing else. Thought with its associations never arose. There was no image-making. He often attempted to think but no thought would come."</i> <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Writing about his childhood and early adolescence in memoirs he composed when he was eighteen years old, Krishnamurti described <a href="/wiki/Psychic" title="Psychic">psychic</a> experiences, such as "<i>seeing</i>" his sister, who had died in 1904, and also his mother, who had passed away in 1905.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Another aspect of his childhood was his bond with nature that continued throughout his life: <i>"...He always had this strange lack of distance between himself and the trees, rivers and mountains. It wasn't cultivated."</i><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Krishnamurti's father Narianiah retired at the end of 1907, and, being of limited means, wrote to Annie Besant, then president of the Theosophical Society, seeking employment at the Theosophical headquarters estate at Adyar. (Even though an observant orthodox Brahmin, Narianiah had been a member of the Theosophical Society since 1882).<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> He was eventually hired by the Society as a clerk, and he moved his family there in January, 1909.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Narianiah and his sons were at first assigned to live in a small cottage that lacked adequate sanitation and which was located just outside the Theosophical compound. As a result of poor living conditions, Krishnamurti and his brothers were soon undernourished and infested with <a href="/wiki/Lice" title="Lice" class="mw-redirect">lice</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>It was in April 1909, a few months after the last move, that Krishnamurti first met C.W. Leadbeater, who claimed <a href="/wiki/Clairvoyance" title="Clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a>. During his forays to the Theosophical estate's beach at the nearby Adyar river, Leadbeater had noticed Krishnamurti (who also frequented the beach with others), and was amazed by the <i>"most wonderful aura he had ever seen, without a particle of selfishness in it"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> This strong impression was notwithstanding Krishnamurti's outward appearance, which, according to eyewitnesses, was pretty common, unimpressive, and unkempt. The boy was also considered <i>"particularly dim-witted"</i>; he often had <i>"a vacant expression"</i> that <i>"gave him an almost moronic look"</i>. Leadbeater remained <i>"unshaken"</i> that the boy would become <i>"a great teacher"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

There was an element of subservience, obedience. The boy was vague, uncertain, woolly; he didn't seem to care what was happening. He was like a vessel, with a large hole in it, whatever was put in, went through, nothing remained."</i><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Following his "discovery", Krishnamurti was taken under the wing of the leadership of the Theosophical Society in Adyar and their inner circle. Leadbeater and a small number of trusted associates undertook the task of educating, protecting, and generally preparing Krishnamurti as the "vehicle" of the expected World Teacher.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Krishnamurti (or <i>Krishnaji</i> as he was often called)<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> and his younger brother Nitya were privately tutored at the Theosophical compound in Madras, and later exposed to a comparatively opulent life among a segment of European high society, as they continued their education abroad. In spite of his history of problems with school work and concerns about his capacities and physical condition, the fourteen year old Krishnamurti was within six months able to speak and write competently in English.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During all this time, Krishnamurti had developed a strong bond with Annie Besant, and came to view her as a surrogate mother. Apart from his early close relationship with his mother, this was the first of several important and intimate relationships that Krishnamurti established with women during his lifetime. His father, pushed into the background by the swirl of interest around Krishnamurti, sued the Theosophical Society in 1912 to protect his parental interests. After a protracted legal battle, Besant took custody of Krishnamurti and his brother Nitya.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> As a result of this separation from his family and home, Krishnamurti and his brother became extremely close, and in the following years they often traveled together.</p>
<p>The Theosophical Leadership in 1911 established a new organization called the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Star_in_the_East" title="Order of the Star in the East">Order of the Star in the East</a>, in order to prepare the world for the aforementioned "coming". Krishnamurti was named as its head, with senior Theosophists in various positions.

<p><a href="/wiki/Mary_Lutyens" title="Mary Lutyens">Mary Lutyens</a>, in her biography of Krishnamurti,<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> states that there was a time when he fully believed that he was to become the World Teacher after correct spiritual and secular guidance and education. Another biographer describes the daily program imposed on him by Leadbeater and his associates, which among other things included rigorous exercise and sports, tutoring in a variety of school subjects, theosophical and religious lessons, yoga and meditation, as well as instruction in proper hygiene and the ways of British society and culture.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> Unlike sports, where he showed natural aptitude, Krishnamurti always had problems with formal schooling and was not academically inclined. He eventually gave up university education after several attempts at admission. He did take to foreign languages, eventually speaking several (French and Italian among them) with some fluency. In this period, he apparently enjoyed reading parts of the <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, and was impressed by some of the Western classics, especially <a href="/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley" title="Percy Bysshe Shelley">Shelley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky" title="Fyodor Dostoyevsky">Dostoyevsky</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a>. He also had, since childhood, considerable observational and mechanical skills, being able to correctly disassemble and reassemble complicated machinery.</p>
<p>His public image, as originally cultivated by the theosophists, <i>"...was to be characterized by a well-polished exterior, a sobriety of purpose, a cosmopolitan outlook and an otherworldly, almost beatific detachment in his demeanor."</i> And in fact, <i>"...All of these can be said to have characterised Krishnamurti's public image to the end of his life."</i><sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> It was apparently clear early on that he <i>"...possessed an innate personal magnetism, not of a warm physical variety, but nonetheless emotive in its austerity, and inclined to inspire veneration."</i><sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> However, as Krishnamurti was growing up, he showed signs of adolescent rebellion and emotional instability, chafing at the regimen imposed on him, and occasionally having doubts about the future prescribed him.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Krishnamurti and Nitya were taken to England for the first time in April 1911. Between that time and the start of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> in 1914, they also visited several other European countries, always accompanied by theosophist chaperones.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> After the war, Krishnamurti (again accompanied by his brother) embarked on a series of lectures, meetings, and discussions around the world relating to his duties as the head of the <i>Order Of The Star</i>. In 1922, Krishnamurti and Nitya travelled from <a href="/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> to California on their way to Switzerland. While in California, they lodged at a cottage in then relatively secluded Ojai Valley, offered to them for the occasion by an American member of the Order.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> At Ojai, the brothers also met Rosalind Williams, the sister of a local Theosophist, who eventually became close to them both.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> For the first time the brothers were without immediate supervision from their Theosophical Society minders; they spent their time in nature hikes and picnics with friends, spiritual contemplation, and planning their course within the <i>"World Teacher Project"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Krishnamurti and Nitya found the Ojai Valley to be very agreeable, and eventually a trust, formed by supporters, purchased for them the cottage and surrounding property, which henceforth became Krishnamurti's official place of residence.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>It was in Ojai, in August 1922, that Krishnamurti went through an intense, "<i>life-changing</i>" experience.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> It has been simultaneously, and invariably, characterised as a spiritual awakening, a psychological transformation, and a physical conditioning. Krishnamurti and those around him would refer to it as <i>"the process"</i>, and it continued, at very frequent intervals and varying forms of intensity, until his death.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> According to witnesses, it started on the 17th, with Krishnamurti complaining of extraordinary pain at the nape of his neck, and a hard, ball-like swelling. Over the next couple of days, the symptoms worsened, with increasing pain, extreme physical discomfort and sensitivity, total loss of appetite and occasional delirious ramblings. Then, he seemed to lapse into unconsciousness; actually, he recounted that he was very much aware of his surroundings and while in that state, he had an experience of mystical union.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> The following day the symptoms, and the experience, intensified, climaxing with a sense of <i>"immense peace"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45" title=""><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...I was supremely happy, for I had seen. Nothing could ever be the same. I have drunk at the clear and pure waters and my thirst was appeased. ...I have seen the Light. I have touched compassion which heals all sorrow and suffering; it is not for myself, but for the world. ...Love in all its glory has intoxicated my heart; my heart can never be closed. I have drunk at the fountain of Joy and eternal Beauty. I am God-intoxicated."<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46" title=""><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar incidents continued with short intermissions until October, and later eventually resumed regularly, always involving varying degrees of physical pain to mark the start of "the process", accompanied by what is variably described as <i>"presence"</i>, <i>"benediction"</i>, <i>"immensity"</i>, and <i>"sacredness"</i>, which was reportedly often felt by others present.</p>
<p>Several explanations have been proposed for the events of 1922, and "the process" in general.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47" title=""><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> Leadbeater and other theosophists, although they expected the "vehicle" to have certain <a href="/wiki/Paranormal" title="Paranormal">paranormal</a> experiences, were mystified by the developments, and were at a loss to explain the whole thing. Krishnamurti himself told Pupul Jayakar about the process many decades later in 1979:”It was possible that the pain and what took place was necessary as the brain was not ready. Traces of immaturity remained; the brain cells were not large enough to receive the Energy. When the Energy comes pouring in and the brain is not capable of holding it, then that Energy feels it has to polish it up. It may be its own activity.” <sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup>The "process", and the inability of Leadbeater to explain it satisfactorily, if at all, had other consequences according to biographer R. Vernon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The process at Ojai, whatever its cause or validity, was a cataclysmic milestone for Krishna. Up until this time his spiritual progress, chequered though it might have been, had been planned with solemn deliberation by Theosophy's grandees. ...Something new had now occurred for which Krishna's training had not entirely prepared him. ...A burden was lifted from his conscience and he took his first step towards becoming an individual. ...In terms of his future role as a teacher, the process was his bedrock. ...It had come to him alone and had not been planted in him by his mentors...It provided Krishna with the soil in which his newfound spirit of confidence and independence could take root."<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50" title=""><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the unexpected death of his brother Nitya on November 11, 1925 at age 27 from tuberculosis after a long history with the disease, fundamentally shook Krishnamurti's belief in <a href="/wiki/Theosophy" title="Theosophy">Theosophy</a> and his faith in the leaders of the Theosophical Society.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51" title=""><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52" title=""><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> According to eyewitness accounts, the news <i>"...broke him down completely"</i>. He struggled for days to overcome his sorrow, eventually <i>"...going through an inner revolution, finding new strength"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53" title=""><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> The experience of his brother's death apparently shattered any remaining illusions, and things would never be the same again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...An old dream is dead and a new one is being born, as a flower that pushes through the solid earth. A new vision is coming into being and a greater consciousness is being unfolded. ...A new strength, born of suffering, is pulsating in the veins and a new sympathy and understanding is being born of past suffering - a greater desire to see others suffer less, and, if they must suffer, to see that they bear it nobly and come out of it without too many scars. I have wept, but I do not want others to weep; but if they do, I know what it means."<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the next few years Krishnamurti's new vision and consciousness continued to develop and reached a climax in 1929, when he rebuffed attempts by Leadbeater and Besant to continue with the <i>Order of the Star</i>. Krishnamurti dissolved the Order at the annual Star Camp at <a href="/wiki/Ommen" title="Ommen">Ommen</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Netherlands" title="The Netherlands" class="mw-redirect">the Netherlands</a>, on August 3rd, 1929<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" title=""><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup> where, in front of Annie Besant and several thousand members, he gave a speech<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57" title=""><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> saying among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You may remember the story of how the devil and a friend of his were walking down the street, when they saw ahead of them a man stoop down and pick up something from the ground, look at it, and put it away in his pocket. The friend said to the devil, 'What did that man pick up?' 'He picked up a piece of the truth,' said the devil. 'That is a very bad business for you, then,' said his friend. 'Oh, not at all,' the devil replied, 'I am going to help him organize it.'</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I maintain that truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect.

<p>and also:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Following the dissolution, some Theosophists turned against Krishnamurti and publicly wondered whether <i>"...the Coming had gone wrong"</i>. Mary Lutyens states that "<i>...After all the years of proclaiming the Coming, of stressing over and over again the danger of rejecting the World Teacher when he came because he was bound to say something wholly new and unexpected, something contrary to most people’s preconceived ideas and hopes, the leaders of Theosophy, one after the other, fell into the trap against which they had so unremittingly warned others.</i>"<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Krishnamurti had denounced all organized belief, the notion of <a href="/wiki/Gurus" title="Gurus" class="mw-redirect">gurus</a>, and the whole teacher-follower relationship, vowing instead to work in setting man absolutely, totally free. Mary Lutyens notes that he never actually denied being the World Teacher; when asked, he insisted that the question was irrelevant. In correspondence with Lady Emily Lutyens, who was distressed over the ending of the Order and its <i>World Teacher Project</i>, he remarked: <i>"You know mum I have never denied it [being the World Teacher], I have only said it does not matter who or what I am but that they should examine what I say, which does not mean that I have denied being the W.T."</i> When a reporter asked him if he was the <a href="/wiki/Christ" title="Christ">Christ</a>, he answered <i>"Yes, in the pure sense but not in the traditional accepted sense of the word."</i> <sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title=""><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup> From that time, he began to disassociate himself from the Theosophical Society and its teachings and practices, despite being on cordial terms with some of its members and ex-members throughout his life.</p>
<p>Krishnamurti would only refer to his teachings as "<i>the</i>" teachings and not as "<i>my</i>" teachings. His concern was always about "<i>the</i>" teachings: the teacher had no importance, and spiritual authority was denounced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All authority of any kind, especially in the field of thought and understanding, is the most destructive, evil thing. Leaders destroy the followers and followers destroy the leaders. You have to be your own teacher and your own disciple. You have to question everything that man has accepted as valuable, as necessary."<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Krishnamurti returned all monies and properties donated to the <i>Order of the Star</i> - including a castle in Holland<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> and around 5,000&#160;acres (20&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) of land - to their donors.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64" title=""><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> He subsequently spent the rest of his life holding dialogues and giving public talks across the world on the nature of belief, truth, sorrow, freedom, death, the apparently eternal quest for a spiritually-fulfilled life, and related subjects. Following on from the "<i>pathless land</i>" notion, he accepted neither followers nor worshippers, seeing the relationship between <a href="/wiki/Disciple" title="Disciple">disciple</a> and guru as encouraging the antithesis of spiritual emancipation - dependency and exploitation. He constantly urged people to think independently and clearly, and invited them to explore and discuss specific topics together with him, to "<i>walk as two friends</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65" title=""><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup> He accepted gifts and financial support freely offered to him by people inspired by his work, and continued with lecture tours and the publication of books and talk transcripts for more than half a century.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66" title=""><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>From 1930 through 1944, Krishnamurti engaged in speaking tours and in the issue of publications under the auspice of the "<i>Star Publishing Trust</i>" (SPT), which he had founded with a close associate and friend from the <i>Order of the Star</i>, D.

<p>Krishnamurti broke the hiatus from public speaking in May 1944 with a series of talks in Ojai. These talks, and subsequent material, were published by "<i>Krishnamurti Writings Inc</i>" (KWINC), the successor organization to the "<i>Star Publishing Trust</i>".

In his meetings with Nehru, Krishnamurti elaborated at length on the teachings, saying in one instance, <i>“Understanding of the self only arises in relationship, in watching yourself in relationship to people, ideas, and things; to trees, the earth, and the world around you and within you. Relationship is the mirror in which the self is revealed. Without self-knowledge there is no basis for right thought and action.”</i> Nehru asked, <i>“How does one start?”</i> to which Krishnamurti replied, <i>“Begin where you are.

The two men soon became close friends and started a common inquiry, in the form of personal dialogues - and occasionally in group discussions with other participants - that periodically continued over nearly two decades.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78" title=""><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79" title=""><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup> Several of these discussions were published in the form of books or as parts of books, and introduced a wider audience (among scientists) to Krishnamurti's ideas than was previously the case.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80" title=""><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81" title=""><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup> Through Bohm, Krishnamurti also met, and held discussions with, several other members of the scientific community. Their long friendship went through a rocky interval in later years, and although they overcame their differences and remained friends until Krishnamurti's death, the relationship did not reattain its previous intensity.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82" title=""><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83" title=""><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84" title=""><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Although Krishnamurti's subject matter had evolved to encompass several new and different directions,<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85" title=""><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup> the fundamental notions remained unchanged. In late 1980, he took the opportunity to reaffirm the basic elements of his message in a written statement that came to be known as the <i>"Core of the Teaching"</i>. An excerpt follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The core of Krishnamurti's teaching is contained in the statement he made in 1929 when he said: 'Truth is a pathless land'. Man cannot come to it through any organization, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, nor through any philosophical knowledge or psychological technique. He has to find it through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contents of his own mind, through observation, and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection. Man has built in himself images as a sense of security—religious, political, personal. These manifest as symbols, ideas, beliefs. The burden of these dominates man's thinking, relationships and his daily life. These are the causes of our problems for they divide man from man in every relationship."<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86" title=""><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87" title=""><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 1970s, Krishnamurti met several times with then Indian prime minister <a href="/wiki/Indira_Gandhi" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>, with whom he had far ranging, and apparently, in some cases very serious discussions. His true impact on Indian political life is unknown; however Jayakar considers his attitude and message on meetings with Indira Gandhi as a possible influence in the lifting of certain emergency measures Mrs. Gandhi had imposed during periods of political turmoil.<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88" title=""><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Krishnamurti's once close relationship with the Rajagopals had deteriorated to the point where Krishnamurti took D. Rajagopal to court in order to recover donated property and funds, publication rights for his works, manuscripts, and personal correspondence, that were in Rajagopal's possession.<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89" title=""><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup> The litigation and ensuing cross complaints, which formally began in 1971, continued for many years and were finally settled in 1986, shortly after the death of Krishnamurti even though a substantial portion of materials and property had been recovered during his lifetime.<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90" title=""><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91" title=""><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In April 1985 he spoke to an invited audience at the United Nations in New York, where he was awarded the United Nations 1984 Peace medal.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92" title=""><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In November 1985 he visited India for the last time, holding a number of what came to be known as "farewell" talks and discussions between then and January 1986. These last talks included the fundamental questions he had been asking through the years, as well as newer concerns related to then recent advances in science, technology, and the way they affected humankind. Krishnamurti had commented to friends that he did not wish to invite death, but was not sure how long his body would last (he had already lost considerable weight), and once he could no longer talk, he would have "<i>no further purpose</i>". In his final talk, on January 4, 1986, in Madras, he again invited the audience to examine with him the nature of <a href="/wiki/Inquiry" title="Inquiry">inquiry</a>, the effect of technology, the nature of life and meditation, and the nature of <a href="/wiki/Creation_myth" title="Creation myth">creation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...So, we are enquiring into what makes a bird. What is creation behind all this? Are you waiting for me to describe it, go into it? You want me to go into it? Why (From the audience: To understand what creation is[)]. Why do you ask that? Because I asked? No description can ever describe the origin. The origin is nameless; the origin is absolutely quiet, it's not whirring about making noise. Creation is something that is most holy, that's the most sacred thing in life, and if you have made a mess of your life, change it. Change it today, not tomorrow. If you are uncertain, find out why and be certain. If your thinking is not straight, think straight, logically. Unless all that is prepared, all that is settled, you can't enter into this world, into the world of creation."<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93" title=""><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Krishnamurti was also concerned about his legacy, about being unwittingly turned into some personage whose teachings had been handed down to special individuals, rather than the world at large. He did not want anybody to pose as an interpreter of the teaching.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94" title=""><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> He warned his associates on several occasions that they were not to present themselves as spokesmen on his behalf, or as his successors after his death.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95" title=""><span>[</span>96<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A few days before his death, in a final statement, he emphatically declared that <i>"nobody"</i> - among his associates, or the general public - had understood what had happened to him (as the conduit of the teaching), nor had they understood the teaching itself. He added that the <i>"immense energy"</i> operating in his lifetime would be gone with his death, again implying the impossibility of successors. However, he offered hope by stating that people could approach that energy and gain a measure of understanding <i>"...if they live the teachings"</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96" title=""><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup> In prior discussions he had compared himself with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, implying that he did the hard work, and now all was needed by others was a flick of the switch.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97" title=""><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup> In another instance he talked of <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" title="Christopher Columbus">Columbus</a> going through an arduous journey to discover the New World, whereas now, it could easily be reached by jet; the ultimate implication being that even if Krishnamurti was in some way "special", in order to arrive at his level of understanding, others didn't need to be.<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98" title=""><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>J. Krishnamurti died on February 17, 1986, at the age of 90, from <a href="/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer" title="Pancreatic cancer">pancreatic cancer</a>. His remains were cremated and scattered by friends and former associates in the three countries where he had spent most of his life: India, England, and the United States of America.</p>

<p>Krishnamurti constantly emphasized the right place of thought in daily life. But he also pointed out the dangers of thought when it becomes knowledge that acts as a calcified projection of the past. According to Krishnamurti, such action distorts our perception and full understanding of the world we live in, and more specifically, the relationships that define it. Some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How is the mind which functions on knowledge – how is the brain which is recording all the time – to end, to see the importance of recording and not let it move in any other direction? Very simply: you insult me, you hurt me, by word, gesture, by an actual act; that leaves a mark on the brain which is memory. That memory is knowledge, that knowledge is going to interfere in my meeting you next time – obviously. ... Knowledge is necessary to act in the sense of my going home from here to the place I live; I must have knowledge for this; I must have knowledge to speak English; I must have knowledge to write a letter and so on. Knowledge as function, mechanical function, is necessary. Now if I use that knowledge in my relationship with you, another human being, I am bringing about a barrier, a division between you and me, namely the observer. That is, knowledge, in relationship, in human relationship, is destructive. That is knowledge which is the tradition, the memory, the image, which the mind has built about you, that knowledge is separative and therefore creates conflict in our relationship."<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99" title=""><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"The brain has been trained to record for in that recording there is safety, security, a sense of vitality; in that recording the mind creates the image about oneself. And that image will constantly get hurt. Is it possible to live without a single image about yourself, or about your husband, wife, children, or about the politicians, the priests, or about the ideal? It is possible, and if it is not found you will always be getting hurt, always living in a pattern in which there is no freedom. When you give complete attention there is no recording. It is only when there is inattention that you record. That is: you flatter me; I like it; the liking at that moment is inattention therefore recording takes place. But if when you flatter me I listen to it completely without any reaction, then there is no center which records."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"The brain is the source of thought. The brain is matter and thought is matter. Can the brain – with all its reactions and its immediate responses to every challenge and demand – can the brain be very still? It is not a question of ending thought, but of whether the brain can be completely still? This stillness is not physical death. See what happens when the brain is completely still."<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100" title=""><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Fear and pleasure were lifelong themes in his public talks. The following is an excerpt from his talk in San Diego in 1970.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fear is always in relation to something; it does not exist by itself. There is fear of what happened yesterday in relation to the possibility of its repetition tomorrow; there is always a fixed point from which relationship takes place. How does fear come into this? I had pain yesterday; there is the memory of it and I do not want it again tomorrow. Thinking about the pain of yesterday, thinking which involves the memory of yesterday’s pain, projects the fear of having pain again tomorrow. So it is thought that brings about fear. Thought breeds fear; thought also cultivates pleasure. To understand fear you must also understand pleasure – they are interrelated; without understanding one you cannot understand the other. This means that one cannot say ‘I must only have pleasure and no fear’; fear is the other side of the coin which is called pleasure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thinking with the images of yesterday’s pleasure, thought imagines that you may not have that pleasure tomorrow; so thought engenders fear. Thought tries to sustain pleasure and thereby nourishes fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thought has separated itself as the analyzer and the thing to be analyzed; they are both parts of thought playing tricks upon itself. In doing all this it is refusing to examine the unconscious fears; it brings in time as a means of escaping fear and yet at the same time sustains fear.”<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101" title=""><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Krishnamurti used the term "meditation" to mean something entirely different from the practice of any system or method to control the mind, or to consciously achieve a specific goal or state. He dealt with the subject of meditation in numerous public talks and discussions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A mind that is in meditation is concerned only with meditation, not with the meditator. The meditator is the observer, the senser, the thinker, the experiencer, and when there is the experiencer, the thinker, then he is concerned with reaching out, gaining, achieving, experiencing. And that thing which is timeless cannot be experienced. There is no experience at all. There is only that which is not nameable.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You know, in all this there are various powers like clairvoyance, reading somebody’s thought – which is the most disgusting thing to do: it is like reading letters that are private. There are various powers. You know what I am talking about, don’t you? You call them <a href="/wiki/Siddhi" title="Siddhi">siddhis</a>, don’t you? Do you know that all these things are like candles in the sun? When there is no sun there is darkness, and then the candle and the light of the candle become very important. But when there is the sun, the light, the beauty, the clarity, then all these powers, these siddhis – developing various centres, chakras, kundalini, you know all that business – are like candlelight; they have no value at all. And when you have that light, you don’t want anything else.”<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102" title=""><span>[</span>103<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Meditation is one of the greatest arts in life-perhaps <b>the</b> greatest, and one cannot possibly learn it from anybody, that is the beauty of it. It has no technique and therefore no authority. When you learn about yourself, watch yourself, watch the way you walk, how you eat, what you say, the gossip, the hate, the jealousy-if you are aware of all that in yourself, without any choice, that is part of meditation."<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103" title=""><span>[</span>104<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Man, in order to escape his conflicts, has invented many forms of meditation. These have been based on desire, will, and the urge for achievement, and imply conflict and a struggle to arrive. This conscious, deliberate striving is always within the limits of a conditioned mind, and in this there is no freedom. All effort to meditate is the denial of meditation. Meditation is the ending of thought. It is only then that there is a different dimension which is beyond time.”<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104" title=""><span>[</span>105<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Meditation is the emptying of the mind of all thought, for thought and feeling dissipate energy. They are repetitive, producing mechanical activities which are a necessary part of existence. But they are only part, and thought and feeling cannot possibly enter into the immensity of life. Quite a different approach is necessary, not the path of habit, association and the known; there must be freedom from these. Meditation is the emptying of the mind of the known. It cannot be done by thought or by the hidden prompting of thought, nor by desire in the form of prayer, nor through the self-effacing hypnotism of words, images, hopes, and vanities. All these have to come to an end, easily, without effort and choice, in the flame of awareness.”<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-105" title=""><span>[</span>106<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>According to Krishnamurti, many problems in the world such as poverty, war, the nuclear threat, and other unfortunate circumstances, have their roots in our thinking. In his view, as we live and behave according to our thinking so wars and governments are also a result of our thinking. We each have our own particular beliefs, conclusions, and experiences, to which we cling, thereby isolating ourselves from others. Self centered activity is expressed outwardly as nationalism and religious intolerance, creating a world divided, in which we are willing to kill for the sake of belief.

<p>Krishnamurti's lasting influence is hard to gauge in an objective way; there is no organizational or other entity based on his philosophy, whose progress can be measured. His insistence that there be no successors or interpreters has so far<sup id="cite_ref-multiref1_110-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-multiref1-110" title=""><span>[</span>111<span>]</span></a></sup> prevented any individual or group from claiming to represent a continuity, or a unique understanding, of his philosophy. Krishnamurti himself remarked in 1929, at the dissolution of the Order of the Star, that he was not interested in numbers, stating: <i>"If there are only five people who will listen, who will live, who have their faces turned towards eternity, it will be sufficient."</i><sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-111" title=""><span>[</span>112<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Many books, as well as audio, video, and computer materials, remain in print and are carried by major online and traditional retailers. The four official Foundations continue with the maintenance of archives, dissemination of the teachings in an increasing number of languages, new conversions to digital and other media, development of websites, sponsoring of television programs, and with organizing meetings and dialogues of interested persons around the world.<sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-112" title=""><span>[</span>113<span>]</span></a></sup> According to communications and press releases from the Foundations, their mailing lists, and individuals' inquiries, continue to grow.<sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113" title=""><span>[</span>114<span>]</span></a></sup> The various schools and educational institutions also continue to grow, with new projects added alongside their declared goal of <a href="/wiki/Holistic_education" title="Holistic education">holistic education</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114" title=""><span>[</span>115<span>]</span></a></sup> There are also active unofficial <i>Krishnamurti Committees</i> operating in several countries.</p>

Cursory (and necessarily incomplete) examination of internet search traffic and group discussion forums indicates that among similar topics, interest on Krishnamurti remains high.</p>
<p>Because of his ideas and his era, Krishnamurti has come to be seen as an exemplar of those spiritual teachers who disavow formal rituals and dogma. His conception of truth as a "<i>pathless land</i>", with the possibility of immediate liberation, is mirrored in teachings as diverse as those of <a href="/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training" title="Erhard Seminars Training">est</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Lee" title="Bruce Lee">Bruce Lee</a><sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115" title=""><span>[</span>116<span>]</span></a></sup> , <a href="/wiki/Barry_Long" title="Barry Long">Barry Long</a><sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116" title=""><span>[</span>117<span>]</span></a></sup>, and the <a href="/wiki/Dalai_Lama" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a>.</p>

<p>In India, with its long tradition of wandering "holy" men, hermits, and independent religious teachers, Krishnamurti attracted the attention (and occasionally the unwanted admiration) of large numbers of people in public lectures and personal interviews. He was, and is presently, considered a <i>"great teacher"</i> by such diverse religious figures as the respected mystic <a href="/wiki/Ramana_Maharshi" title="Ramana Maharshi">Ramana Maharshi</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119" title=""><span>[</span>120<span>]</span></a></sup> the spiritual teacher <a href="/wiki/Sri_Anandamoyi_Ma" title="Sri Anandamoyi Ma" class="mw-redirect">Anandamayi Ma</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120" title=""><span>[</span>121<span>]</span></a></sup> as well as figures more well-known to the West such as <a href="/wiki/Osho" title="Osho">Osho</a>.

<p>As was also often the case elsewhere, Krishnamurti additionally attracted the interest of the mainstream religious establishment in India. He was friendly, and had a number of discussions with, well known Hindu and Buddhist scholars and leaders, including the <a href="/wiki/Dalai_Lama" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122" title=""><span>[</span>123<span>]</span></a></sup> Several of these discussions were later published as chapters in various Krishnamurti books.</p>
<p>Twentieth-century gnostic philosopher and occultist <a href="/wiki/Samael_Aun_Weor" title="Samael Aun Weor">Samael Aun Weor</a> praised Krishnamurti's teachings, stating that his "<i>inner spirit</i>" was a "<i>highly realized Buddha</i>", although he questioned his handling by the theosophists and its effect on his spiritual development.<sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123" title=""><span>[</span>124<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Any discussion of influence, however expansive, deserves to be weighed against Krishnamurti's own measure of success i.e., whether individuals really understand, and therefore <i>"live and breathe"</i>, the teaching.<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124" title=""><span>[</span>125<span>]</span></a></sup> Regarding this measure of influence or success, the last, and only, definitive public statement belongs to Krishnamurti himself. In a dismal prognosis, delivered 10 days prior his death in 1986, his words were simple, and emphatic: <i>"nobody"</i> – among his associates or the world at large – had understood Krishnamurti, his life, or the teaching.</p>

<p>A number of people questioned whether Krishnamurti's attitudes were conditioned by privilege, as he was supported, even pampered, by devoted followers starting as far back as his "discovery" by the theosophists. Helen Nearing, who had known Krishnamurti in the 1920s, made such an assessment in an autobiographical volume (<i>Loving and Leaving the Good Life</i>, see <a href="/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti#Other_biographies.2Fmemoirs.2Freminiscences" title="Jiddu Krishnamurti">Other Biographies</a> section below). She also thought that he was at such an "elevated" level that he was incapable of forming normal personal relationships.<sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125" title=""><span>[</span>126<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In her 1991 book, <i>Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti</i> (see <a href="/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti#Other_biographies.2Fmemoirs.2Freminiscences" title="Jiddu Krishnamurti">Other Biographies</a>), Radha Rajagopal Sloss, the daughter of estranged Krishnamurti associates Rosalind and Desikacharya Rajagopal, wrote of Krishnamurti's relationship with her parents, including a secret affair between Krishnamurti and Rosalind which lasted for many years. The public revelation was received with surprise and consternation by many individuals, and was also dealt with in a rebuttal volume of biography by Mary Lutyens (<i>Krishnamurti and the Rajagopals</i>, also see <a href="/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti#Other_biographies.2Fmemoirs.2Freminiscences" title="Jiddu Krishnamurti">Other Biographies</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126" title=""><span>[</span>127<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

She considers young Krishnamurti "<i>beautiful</i>", based on contemporary photographs. Even if that was the case, it could be said that Krishnamurti was "chosen" despite the theosophists' cultural background, rather than because of it.</li>

<li id="cite_note-85"><b><a href="#cite_ref-85" title="">^</a></b> A recurrent theme in his later talks and discussions was the need for "<i>a new brain</i>": a "<i>radical</i>", physical, "<i><a href="/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">mutation</a></i>" of the brain cells that would "<i>wipe out</i>" unnecessary baggage accumulated in human consciousness throughout its evolutionary history. This would then naturally result in direct perception of present reality, unencumbered by the filters of past experience. According to Krishnamurti, such "<i>mutation</i>" - regeneration of the brain - can logically only happen instantaneously and in toto; otherwise the "old" consciousness, in self-defense, will use the intervening time to distract from the task and so avoid its "death". He constantly reminded his audience to be aware of such actions by the "old" brain, and also to realize that just "<i>[f]actually seeing</i>" the need for a new brain objectively, without judgement (and therefore without pondering it in time), will bring about the change. Recently, the idea that such mutation may be at least within the realm of possibility has found some currency in the new science of <a href="/wiki/Neuroplasticity" title="Neuroplasticity">neuroplasticity</a>, which posits that the <a href="/wiki/Anatomy" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a> of the brain changes through experience, and that new <a href="/wiki/Neural" title="Neural" class="mw-redirect">neural</a> connections can appear in areas of the brain that were previously considered immutable.</li>

<p>During 1969 and 1970, Krishnamurti and his associates established several foundations - in the UK (1969), the United States (1969), India (1970 - originally established as <i>The Rishi Valley Trust</i> in 1928), and Argentina (1970 - now relocated to Spain) - with a two-fold purpose: the dissemination of Krishnamurti's talks, discussion and writings, and the facilitation of meetings and discussion on the themes of his philosophy.</p>

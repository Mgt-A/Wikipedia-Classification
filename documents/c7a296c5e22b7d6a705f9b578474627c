<p><b>Jonas Salk</b> (October 28, 1914 – June 23, 1995) was an American <a href="/wiki/Medical_researcher" title="Medical researcher" class="mw-redirect">medical researcher</a> and <a href="/wiki/Virologist" title="Virologist" class="mw-redirect">virologist</a>, best known for his discovery and development of the first safe and effective <a href="/wiki/Polio_vaccine" title="Polio vaccine">polio vaccine</a>. He was born in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where his parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants. Although they themselves lacked formal education, they were determined to see their children succeed. During his years at medical school at <a href="/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a>, he stood out from his peers not just because of his academic prowess, but because he chose to do medical research instead of becoming a physician.</p>
<p>Until 1955, when the Salk vaccine was introduced, polio was considered the most frightening public health problem of the postwar era. Annual epidemics kept getting worse and victims were usually children. By 1952 it was killing more of them than any other communicable disease with over 57,000 cases reported that year. The "public reaction was to a plague," said historian William O'Neill. "Citizens of urban areas were to be terrified every summer when this frightful visitor returned." As a result, scientists were in a frantic race to find a cure. President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> was the world's most recognized victim of the disease and founded the institute to fund and create a vaccine.</p>
<p>In 1947, Salk accepted an appointment to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh" title="University of Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a> School of Medicine. While working there, with the <a href="/wiki/National_Foundation_for_Infantile_Paralysis" title="National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis" class="mw-redirect">National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis</a>, Salk saw an opportunity to develop a vaccine against polio, and devoted himself to this work for the next eight years. The field tests Salk set up were, according to O'Neill, "the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers." When news of the discovery was made public on April 12, 1955, Salk was hailed as a "miracle worker," and the day "almost became a national holiday." He further endeared himself to the public by refusing to patent the vaccine, as he had no desire to profit personally from the discovery, but merely wished to see the vaccine disseminated as widely as possible.</p>
<p>In 1963, he founded the <a href="/wiki/Salk_Institute_for_Biological_Studies" title="Salk Institute for Biological Studies">Salk Institute for Biological Studies</a> in La Jolla, California, which is today a center for medical and scientific research. He continued to conduct research and publish books, including <i>Man Unfolding</i> (1972), <i>The Survival of the Wisest</i> (1973), <i>World Population and Human Values: A New Reality</i> (1981), and <i>Anatomy of Reality</i> (1983). Dr. Salk's last years were spent searching for a vaccine against AIDS. He died on June 23, 1995 at the age of 80.</p>

<p>Jonas Salk was born in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> on October 28, 1914. His parents were <a href="/wiki/Russians" title="Russians">Russian</a>-<a href="/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jewish</a> immigrants, Daniel and Dora Salk. According to historian <a href="/wiki/David_Oshinsky" title="David Oshinsky">David Oshinsky</a>, Jonas Salk grew up in the "Jewish immigrant culture" of New York City. He had two younger brothers, Lee and Herman, and an uncle, Bruno Salk. The family lived in <a href="/wiki/East_Harlem" title="East Harlem" class="mw-redirect">East Harlem</a>, later moving to the <a href="/wiki/Bronx" title="Bronx" class="mw-redirect">Bronx</a> and eventually settled in <a href="/wiki/Queens_(New_York)" title="Queens (New York)" class="mw-redirect">Queens</a>.</p>
<p>His father, Daniel, unable to complete grade school in Russia, eventually emigrated to America where he worked in New York's garment district. Lee Salk, in his autobiography, would write of him: "He was something of a <a href="/wiki/Willy_Loman" title="Willy Loman" class="mw-redirect">Willy Loman</a> character from <i><a href="/wiki/Death_of_a_Salesman" title="Death of a Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a></i>, beaten down in business but still believing that success would soon be his." Because of his long hours at work he had to leave most of the child-rearing duties to his his wife. <sup id="cite_ref-LeeSalk_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LeeSalk-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:10</sup></span></p>
<p>Jonas's mother was also mostly uneducated and likewise had emigrated to the U.S. where she would use her time raising their three sons. According to Jonas, "She wanted to be sure that we all were going to advance in the world. Therefore we were encouraged in our studies and overly protected." She was best remembered for "pushing her three sons relentlessay to excel," writes Oshinsky. <sup id="cite_ref-Oshinsky_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oshinsky-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:95</sup></span></p>
<p>In later years his brother Herman became a <a href="/wiki/Veterinarian" title="Veterinarian">veterinarian</a> and Lee became a <a href="/wiki/Clinical_psychologist" title="Clinical psychologist" class="mw-redirect">clinical psychologist</a>.</p>

<p>When he was 12, Salk entered <a href="/wiki/Townsend_Harris_High_School" title="Townsend Harris High School">Townsend Harris High School</a>, a public school for intellectually gifted students. Named after the founder of <a href="/wiki/City_College_of_New_York" title="City College of New York">City College of New York</a> (CCNY), it was, wrote Oshinsky, "a launching pad for the talented sons of immigrant parents who lacked the money - and pedigree - to attend a top private school." In high school "he was known as a perfectionist... who read everything he could lay his hands on," according to one of his fellow students.<sup id="cite_ref-Bookchin_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bookchin-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Students were generally forced to cram a four-year curriculum into just three. As a result, most dropped out or flunked out, despite the school's motto "study, study, study." Of the students who graduated, however, most would have the grades to enroll in CCNY, noted for being a highly competitive college. <sup id="cite_ref-Oshinsky_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oshinsky-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:96</sup></span></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Jonas_Salk&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: College">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">College</span></h3>
<p>Jonas enrolled in <a href="/wiki/City_College_of_New_York" title="City College of New York">City College of New York</a> at the height of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> where he earned a <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science" title="Bachelor of Science">B.S.</a> degree. Oshinsky writes that "for working-class immigrant families, City College represented the apex of public higher education. Getting in was tough but tuition was free. Competition was intense, but the rules were fairly applied. No one got an advantage based on an accident of birth." <sup id="cite_ref-Oshinsky_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oshinsky-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>At his mother's urging, he put aside aspirations of becoming a lawyer, and instead concentrated on classes necessary for admission to medical school. However, according to Oshinsky, the facilities at City College were "barely second rate." There were no research laboratories. The library was inadequate. The faculty contained few noted scholars. "What made the place special," he writes, "was the student body that had fought so hard to get there . . . driven by their parents. . . From these ranks, of the 1930s and 1940s, emerged a wealth of intellectual talent, including more <a href="/wiki/Nobel_Prize" title="Nobel Prize">Nobel Prize</a> winners - eight - and PhD recipients than any other public college except the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California_at_Berkeley" title="University of California at Berkeley" class="mw-redirect">University of California at Berkeley</a>."

<p>During his years at the <a href="/wiki/NYU_Medical_School" title="NYU Medical School" class="mw-redirect">Medical School of New York University</a> he stood out from his peers, according to Bookchin, "not just because of his continued academic prowess -- he was <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Omega_Alpha" title="Alpha Omega Alpha">Alpha Omega Alpha</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa" title="Phi Beta Kappa" class="mw-redirect">Phi Beta Kappa</a> of medical education -- but because he had decided he did not want to practice medicine."

<p>During his senior year in medical school he chose a two-month elective to work in the laboratory of Dr. <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Francis" title="Thomas Francis" class="mw-redirect">Thomas Francis</a>. Francis had recently joined the faculty of the medical school after working for the <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation" title="Rockefeller Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, where he had discovered the Type B <a href="/wiki/Influenza_virus" title="Influenza virus" class="mw-redirect">influenza virus</a>. According to Bookchin, "the two month stint in Francis's lab was Salk's first introduction to the world of <a href="/wiki/Virology" title="Virology">virology</a> - and he was hooked." <sup id="cite_ref-Bookchin_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bookchin-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:25</sup></span></p>
<p>After graduating from medical school he began his residency at New York's <a href="/wiki/Mount_Sinai_Hospital" title="Mount Sinai Hospital">Mount Sinai Hospital</a>, where he again worked in Francis's laboratory. Few hospitals in Manhattan had the status of Mount Sinai, particularly among the city's Jews. Oshinsky interviewed a friend of Salk's, who said, "to intern there was like playing ball for the New York Yankees ... only the top men from the nation's medical schools dared apply. Out of 250 who sought the opportunity, only a dozen were chosen."<sup id="cite_ref-Oshinsky_1-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oshinsky-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to Oshinsky, "Salk quickly made his mark." Although focused mainly on research, "he showed tremendous skills as a clinician and a surgeon." But it was "his leadership as president of the house staff of interns and residents at Mount Sinai that best defined him to his peers." The key issue for many of them in 1939, for example, was not the fate of the hospital, but rather the future of Europe after <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>'s invasion of <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>. In one instance, "several interns responded by wearing badges to signify support for the <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allies</a>," but the hospital's director told them to remove them lest they upset some of the patients.</p>
<p>The interns then took the matter to Salk, where he said that "everyone should wear the badge as an act of solidarity." One intern recalled, "Jonas was a very staunch guy. He never took a backward step on that issue or any other issue of principle between us and the hospital." The hospital administrators backed off and there was no further interference from the director.<sup id="cite_ref-Oshinsky_1-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oshinsky-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>At the end of his residency, Salk began applying for permanent research positions. But he discovered that many of the jobs he desired were closed to him due to <a href="/wiki/Jewish_quota" title="Jewish quota">Jewish quotas</a>, which, according to Bookchin, "prevailed in so much of the medical research establishment. Nor could he apply at Mount Sinai as their policy prevented hiring their own interns. As a last resort, he contacted Dr. Francis for help. But Francis had left NYU a year earlier after accepting an offer to direct the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>'s School of Public Health.</p>

<p>However, "Francis did not let him down," writes Bookchin. "He secured extra grant money and offered Salk a job" working on an army-commissioned project in Michigan to develop an influenza vaccine. He and Francis eventually perfected a vaccine that was soon widely used at army bases, where "Salk had been responsible for discovering and isolating one of the flu strains that was included in the final vaccine.<sup id="cite_ref-Bookchin_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bookchin-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:26</sup></span></p>
<p>By 1947, Salk decided to find an institution where he could direct his own laboratory.

<p>Polio was a medical oddity that baffled researchers for years. It was first recorded in 1835 and grew steadily more prevalent. It took a long time to learn that the virus was transmitted by fecal matter and secretions of the nose and throat. It entered the victim orally, established itself in the intestines, and then traveled to the brain or spinal cord. <sup id="cite_ref-ONeill_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ONeill-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>According to American historian William O'Neill, "Paralytic poliomyelitis [its generic name] was, if not the most serious, easily the most frightening public health problem of the postwar era." He noted that the epidemics kept getting worse and its victims were usually children. By 1952 it was killing more of them than any other communicable disease. Of the twenty states that reported the disease back in 1916, there were 27,363 cases. New York alone had 9,023 cases of which 2,448 (28%) resulted in death, and a larger number in paralysis.<sup id="cite_ref-ONeill_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ONeill-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:136</sup></span> However, polio did not gain national attention until 1921, when <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, soon to be governor of <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> and then president of the United States, came down with the disease. <sup id="cite_ref-Olson_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olson-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> At the age of 39, Roosevelt was left with severe paralysis from the disease and spent most of his presidency in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Subsequently, as more states began recording instances of the disease, the numbers of victims grew larger: According to historian James Olson, "during the 1950s, polio reached epidemic proportions. More than 150,000 cases were reported in 1950, and that number jumped to nearly 300,000 in 1952." In some parts of the country, concern assumed almost the dimensions of panic. Olson adds that "parents kept children home from school, avoided parks and swimming pools, and played only in small groups with the closest of friends." Cases usually increased during the summer when children were home from school. "The public reaction was to a plague," noted O'Neill. "Citizens of urban areas were to be terrified every summer when this frightful visitor returned."<sup id="cite_ref-ONeill_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ONeill-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> As a result, Olson points out, "scientists were in a frantic race to find a cure." <sup id="cite_ref-Olson_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Olson-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>As the fear of polio increased each year, funds to combat it increased from $1.8 million to $67 million by 1955. Research continued during those years, but, writes O'Neill, "everything scientists believed about polio at first was wrong, leading them down many blind alleys... furthermore, most researchers were experimenting with highly dangerous <i>live</i> vaccines. In one test six children were killed and three left crippled."<sup id="cite_ref-ONeill_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ONeill-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>"This was the situation when young Jonas Salk, a medical doctor in charge of a virology laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, decided to use the safer <i>killed</i> virus," writes O'Neill. Despite a general lack of enthusiasm for this approach, O'Connor backed Salk handsomely. After successful tests on laboratory animals, it next had to be tested on human beings. "Who would take the risk?" author Dennis Denenberg asked. "Dr. Jonas Salk did ... along with his wife and children, who also allowed themselves to be human guinea pigs."<sup id="cite_ref-Denenberg_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Denenberg-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> In November, 1953, at a national conference in New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, he said, "I will be personally responsible for the vaccine."

<p>It was critical that he develop the trust of the American public for his experiments and mass tests that would become necessary.

<p>The tests Salk set up were, according to O'Neill, "the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers." A 1954 <a href="/wiki/Gallup_poll" title="Gallup poll">Gallup poll</a> showed that more Americans knew about the polio field trials than could give the full name of America's President.

<p>Within minutes of Francis's declaration that the vaccine was safe and effective, the news of the event was carried coast to coast by wire services and radio and televison newscasts. According to Debbie Bookchin, "across the nation there were spontaneous celebrations: church bells rang, fire whistles whined, and business came to a halt as the news spread. The mayor of New York City interrupted a city council meeting to announce the news, adding, 'I think we are all quite proud that Dr. Salk is a graduate of City College.'"<sup id="cite_ref-Bookchin_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bookchin-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:46</sup></span> "By the next morning," writes Bookchin, "politicians around the country were falling over themselves trying to figure out ways they could congratulate Salk, with several suggesting special medals and honors be awarded ... In the <a href="/wiki/Eisenhower" title="Eisenhower" class="mw-redirect">Eisenhower</a> White House, plans were already afoot to present Salk a special presidential medal designating him "a benefactor of mankind" in a Rose Garden ceremony.</p>
<p>It was also declared "a victory for the whole nation." Jonas Salk became "world famous overnight and was showered with awards," writes O'Neill. The governor of Pennsylvania had a medal struck, and the state legislature gave him a chaired professorship. However, New York City could not get him to accept a <a href="/wiki/Ticker_tape_parade" title="Ticker tape parade" class="mw-redirect">ticker tape parade</a>.

<p>According to O'Neill, "April 12th had almost become a national holiday: people observed moments of silence, rang bells, honked horns, blew factory whistles, fired salutes, kept their red lights red in brief periods of tribute, took the rest of the day off, closed their schools or convoked fervid assemblies therein, drank toasts, hugged children, attended church, smiled at strangers, and forgave enemies." <sup id="cite_ref-ONeill_4-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ONeill-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:138</sup></span></p>

<p>Six months before Salk's announcement, optimism and hope were so widespread that the Polio Fund in the U.S. had already contracted to purchase enough of the Salk vaccine to immunize 9,000,000 children and pregnant women the following year.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> And around the world, the official news prompted an immediate international rush to vaccinate. Medical historian Debbie Bookchin writes, "<a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> had committed to the Salk vaccine just days before the final report was released, and now <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="/wiki/Denmark" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norway" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> all announced plans to either immediately begin polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine or to gear up to quickly do so.

<p>By the summer of 1957, over two years later, 100,000,000 doses had been distributed throughout the United States and "reported complications following their administration have been remarkably rare," noted the scientists at the International Polio Conference in Geneva. Scientists from other nations reported similar experiences: Denmark, for example, "reported only a few sporadic cases among the 2,500,000 ... who received the vaccine." Australia reported virtually no polio during her past summer season. <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Other countries where the vaccine was not yet in use suffered continued epidemics, however. In 1957, Hungary, for example, reported a severe epidemic requiring emergency international assistance. By the first half of the year they had 713 reported cases and a death rate of 6.6%, and the peak infection months of summer were still ahead. Canada sent a shipment of vaccine to Hungary by a refrigerated plane, and Britain and Sweden sent <a href="/wiki/Iron_lung" title="Iron lung">iron lungs</a>.

"He still wants to find out a number of things about polio," wrote the <i>New York Times</i> that summer. Questions remained: "How long will the immunity last? Are there any children who cannot be immunized? What improvements can be made?" Beyond that, "he has far bigger goals - 'more in the nature of dreams right now' - involving other diseases."<sup id="cite_ref-NYT7-17-55_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT7-17-55-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Over the next few years, while trying to perfect the polio vaccine, Salk had begun working unannounced, on a cure for <a href="/wiki/Cancer" title="Cancer">cancer</a>. A 1958 article in the <i>New York Times</i> confirmed "that he had been conducting experiments on cancer patients." The news was leaked after a Pittsburgh newspaper, the <i>Sun-Telegraph</i>, reported that he had been giving injections to children suffering from cancer. Salk stated afterwards, "It is true that we have been conducting experiments in many persons with a variety of cancer and cancer-like conditions ... but we have no treatment for cancer.

<p>Years before the Salk vaccine was officialy announced as safe, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Albert_Sabin" title="Albert Sabin">Albert Sabin</a> had also joined in the search for a vaccine, using a <i>live</i>-virus, as opposed to Salk's <i>killed</i>-virus. Sabin, however, had been "openly hostile to Salk." Debbie Bookchin writes that he had been "perhaps accurately guessing that Salk was about to challenge him for ascendancy in the polio world." After one presentation that Salk made to a medical conference, "Sabin mounted a full-scale offensive, engaging in a piecemeal demolition of his presentation."<sup id="cite_ref-Bookchin_2-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bookchin-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> However, the National Foundation "swiftly put its full weight behind Salk.

<p>By 1962 polio had almost become extinct, with only 910 cases reported that year - down from 37,476 in 1954. "It's a matter of principle," Salk said. "It is not a Salk versus Sabin controversy, a competition between two people... I had worked with influenza viruses, helping to establish the efficacy of a <i>killed</i>-virus vaccine... I demonstrated that it could be 100 percent effective if the quantity of virus in the vaccine was sufficient."<sup id="cite_ref-NYT4-8-80_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT4-8-80-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> That same year the state of <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> Health Department recommended "that the Salk vaccine be given preference over the Sabin oral vaccine..."<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On October 20, 1998, after eighteen years of using the Sabin vaccine, however, the federal government recommended that children use the Salk vaccine exclusively. Sabin's polio vaccine is no longer available in the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-Offit_9-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Offit-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:127</sup></span></p>
<dl>
<dt>Looking back - Public confusion over which vaccine to use</dt>
</dl>
<p>In September of 1962, public health officials in the U.S. and Canada faced a "major dilemma": whether or not to continue using the recently begun Sabin vaccine inoculations, until further studies were conducted, due to reports of polio cases among persons who had received it. The U.S. Surgeon General, Luther Terry, recommended a temporary halt due to sixteen cases of confirmed polio in adults. And "the Canadian Federal Health Department recommended against mass use of the [Sabin] oral vaccine pending further study of its effects." One of the unfortunate results caused by the controversy was that "many authorities have deplored the confusion that has been created in the public mind."<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the <a href="/wiki/American_Medical_Association" title="American Medical Association">American Medical Association</a>'s (AMA) "obstructive tactics, however, which caused numerous delays," writes O'Neill, the AMA had called for mass vaccinations in early 1962 employing Sabin's vaccine rather than Salk's. However, writes O'Neill, "as <i>live</i>-virus was more dangerous, it caused an unknown number of polio cases... [but] the medical establishment seemed not to mind, having gotten its own way at last." But, concludes O'Neill, "polio was conquered all the same, even if not so quickly and safely as it might have been." <sup id="cite_ref-ONeill_4-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ONeill-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:139</sup></span></p>
<p>In 1980, Salk pointed out the "renewed interest in his <i>killed</i> virus vaccine, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Developing_countries" title="Developing countries" class="mw-redirect">developing countries</a>. "The <i>live</i> virus vaccine is highly effective in <a href="/wiki/Developed_countries" title="Developed countries" class="mw-redirect">developed countries</a> ...," he said, "but in the developing countries, where polio is on the increase, the drawback is that the live virus fails to establish the infection that leads to immunity because of intestinal inhibitors in the population."<sup id="cite_ref-NYT4-8-80_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT4-8-80-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<dt>Basil O'Connor enters the controversy</dt>
</dl>
<p>Two months after the Salk vaccine was announced to the world, in 1955, <a href="/wiki/Basil_O%27Connor" title="Basil O'Connor">Basil O'Connor</a> found it necessary to respond to critics of the vaccine, especially Dr. Sabin. As the acting president of the <a href="/wiki/National_Foundation_for_Infantile_Paralysis" title="National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis" class="mw-redirect">National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis</a>, he said, during a news conference before a Congressional group in Washington, that "criticism of the Salk vaccine program by Dr. Albert Sabin of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cincinnati" title="University of Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a> was 'old stuff'." According to the New York Times, "Dr. Sabin recommended at a hearing before a House Investigating subcommittee that Salk inoculations be suspended" until a safer preparation could be perfected.<sup id="cite_ref-NYT_OConnor_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT_OConnor-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> O'Connor responded in a prepared statement: (excerpt)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"He's been using it [criticism] for years. He used it in an attempt to stop the field trials of the Salk vaccine... The Salk vaccine is safe and effective and will protect children from paralytic polio to the extent of 60 to 90 percent... In the United States, Canada and Denmark, 7,675,000 children have actually received the Salk vaccine with no untoward results. There could be no better proof of its safety than this. No vaccine in the history of the world has ever had such a test for safety. Anyone who would seek to prevent its use for other than unanswerable scientific reasons would be acting neither as a scientist nor as a humanitarian....</dd>

<dd>"Those who would prevent its use must be prepared to be haunted for life by the crippled bodies of little children who could have been saved from paralysis had they been permitted to receive the Salk vaccine."<sup id="cite_ref-NYT_OConnor_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT_OConnor-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>However, a year and a half after the Salk vaccine was introduced, a Sabin vaccine had still not yet been tested on humans. Sabin himself said, in October of 1956, that "the Salk vaccine is still the only protection against polio available to the public." He was hoping to be able to start tests on humans by the end of the year or by 1957.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On May 6, 1985, President <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> proclaimed that day to be "Jonas Salk Day." Text of the proclamation is below:</p>
<dl>
<dd>One of the greatest challenges to mankind always has been eradicating the presence of debilitating disease. Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands in our own country each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped from the face of the earth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Jonas E. Salk always had a passion for science. It was because of this that he finally chose medicine over law as his career goal. Even after his great discovery, he continued to undertake vital studies and medical research to benefit his fellowman. Under his vision and leadership, the <a href="/wiki/Salk_Institute_for_Biological_Studies" title="Salk Institute for Biological Studies">Salk Institute for Biological Studies</a> has been in the forefront of basic biological research, reaping further benefits for mankind and medical science.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In recognition of his tremendous contributions to society, particularly for his role in the epochal discovery of the first licensed vaccine for poliomyelitis, and in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of its mass distribution, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 258, has designated May 6, 1985, as "Dr. Jonas E. Salk Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 6, 1985, as Dr. Jonas E. Salk Day. I urge the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate tributes, ceremonies, and activities throughout the Nation and by paying honor, at all times, to this outstanding physician and to his life's work. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>Salk, however, preferred not to have his career as a scientist affected by too much personal attention as he had always tried to remain independent and private in his research and life. But this proved to be impossible. "Young man, a great tragedy has befallen you - you've lost your anonymity," the late television personality <a href="/wiki/Ed_Murrow" title="Ed Murrow" class="mw-redirect">Ed Murrow</a> said to Salk shortly after the onslaught of media attention.<sup id="cite_ref-NYT4-8-80_19-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT4-8-80-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Author Jon Cohen noted that "Jonas Salk made scientists and journalists alike go goofy. As one of the only living scientists whose face was known the world over, Salk, in the public's eye, had a superstar aura. Airplane pilots would announce that he was on board, and passengers would burst into applause. Hotels routinely would upgrade him into their penthouse suites. A meal at a restaurant inevitably meant an interruption from an admirer... and scientists approached him with drop-jawed wonder, as though some of the stardust might rub off." <sup id="cite_ref-Cohen_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cohen-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>For the most part, however, Salk was "appalled at the demands on the public figure he has become and resentful of what he considers to be the invasion of his privacy," wrote the <i>New York Times</i>, a few months after his vaccine announcement. <sup id="cite_ref-NYT7-17-55_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT7-17-55-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The Times article noted that "at 40, the once obscure scientist ... was lifted from his laboratory almost to the level of a folk hero." He received a Presidential citation, a score of awards, four honarary degrees, half a dozen foreign decorations, and letters from thousands of fellow citizens. His alma mater, City College of New York, gave him an honorary degree as Doctor of Laws. But "despite such very nice tributes," the <i>New York Times</i> wrote, "Salk is profoundly disturbed by the torrent of fame that has descended upon him.... He talks continually about getting out of the limelight and back to his laboratory... because of his genuine distaste for publicity, which he believes is inappropriate for a scientist." <sup id="cite_ref-NYT7-17-55_8-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT7-17-55-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During a 1980 interview, 25 years later, he said, "It's as if I've been a public property ever since, having to respond to external as well as internal impulses.... It's brought me enormous gratification, opened many opportunities, but at the same time placed many burdens on me.

<p>"If Salk the scientist sounds austere," wrote the <i>New York Times</i>, "Salk the man is a person of great warmth and tremendous enthusiasm. People who meet him generally like him." A Washington newspaper correspondent commented, "He could sell me the Brooklyn Bridge, and I never bought anything before."

<p>He enjoys talking to people he likes, and "he likes a lot of people," wrote the Times. "He talks quickly, articulately, and often in complete paragraphs." And, notes the Times, "He has very little perceptible interest in the things that interest most people - such as making money." That belongs "in the category of mink coats and Cadillacs - unnecessary," he said. <sup id="cite_ref-NYT7-17-55_8-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT7-17-55-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Salk Institute in 1963</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1966, Salk described his "ambitious plan for the creation of a kind of <a href="/wiki/Socratic" title="Socratic">Socratic</a> academy where the supposedly alienated two cultures of science and humanism will have a favorable atmosphere for cross-fertilization."<sup id="cite_ref-Taubman_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Taubman-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> Author and journalist <a href="/wiki/Howard_Taubman" title="Howard Taubman">Howard Taubman</a> explained:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Although he is distinctly future-oriented, Dr. Salk has not lost sight of the institute's immediate aim, which is the development and use of the new biology, called <a href="/wiki/Molecular_biology" title="Molecular biology">molecular</a> and <a href="/wiki/Cellular_biology" title="Cellular biology" class="mw-redirect">cellular biology</a>, described as part physics, part chemistry and part biology. The broad-gauged purpose of this science is to understand man's life processes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"There is talk here of the possibility, once the secret of how the cell is triggered to manufacture <a href="/wiki/Antibodies" title="Antibodies" class="mw-redirect">antibodies</a> is discovered, that a single vaccine may be developed to protect a child against many common infectious diseases. There is speculation about the power to isolate and perhaps eliminate genetic errors that lead to birth defects.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Dr. Salk, a creative man himself, hopes that the institute will do its share in probing the wisdom of nature and thus help enlarge the wisdom of man. for the ultimate purpose of science, humanism and the arts, in his judgment, is the freeing of each individual to cultivate his full creativity, in whichever direction it leads. . . As if to prepare for Socratic encounters such as these, the institute's architect, <a href="/wiki/Louis_Kahn" title="Louis Kahn">Louis Kahn</a>, has installed blackboards in place of concrete facings on the walls along the walks. "<sup id="cite_ref-Taubman_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Taubman-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>

<p>The <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times" class="mw-redirect">New York Times</a></i>, in a 1980 article celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Salk vaccine, described the current workings at the facility:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"At the institute, a magnificent complex of laboratories and study units set on a bluff overlooking the Pacific, Dr. Salk holds the titles of founding director and resident fellow. His own laboratory group is concerned with the <a href="/wiki/Immunology" title="Immunology">immunologic</a> aspects of <a href="/wiki/Cancer" title="Cancer">cancer</a> and the mechanisms of autoimmune disease, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis" title="Multiple sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a></i>, in which the <a href="/wiki/Immune_system" title="Immune system">immune system</a> attacks the body's own tissues. <sup id="cite_ref-NYT4-8-80_19-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT4-8-80-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In an interview about his future hopes at the institute, he said, "In the end, what may have more significance is my creation of the institute and what will come out of it, because of its example as a place for excellence, a creative environment for creative minds."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beginning in the early 1980s, Salk also engaged in research to develop a vaccine for another, more recent plague, <a href="/wiki/AIDS" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>. To further this research, he co-founded The Immune Response Corporation with <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Kimberlin" title="Kevin Kimberlin">Kevin Kimberlin</a>, to search for a vaccine, and patented Remune, an immune-based therapy. <sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> It has not yet been evaluated by the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration" class="mw-redirect">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) for use by people living with HIV, however.</p>
<p>Salk died, at age eighty-one, before a sucessful vaccine was found, and although many advances were made in treating AIDS, "the world still waited for the mircacle vaccine the conqueror of polio had sought," wrote historian Alan Axelrod. <sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup><span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" style="white-space:nowrap"><sup>:294</sup></span></p>

<p>In 1966, the <i>New York Times</i> referred to him as the "Father of Biophilosophy." According to Times journalist and author <a href="/wiki/Howard_Taubman" title="Howard Taubman">Howard Taubman</a>, "he never forgets... there is a vast amount of darkness for man to penetrate. As a biologist, he believes that his science is on the frontier of tremendous new discoveries; and as a philosopher, he is convinced that humanists and artists have joined the scientists to achieve an understanding of man in all his physical, mental and spiritual complexity. Such interchanges might lead, he would hope, to a new and important school of thinkers he would designate as biophilosophers." <sup id="cite_ref-Taubman_27-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Taubman-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Salk describes his "biophilosophy" as the application of a "biological, evolutionary point of view to philosophical, cultural, social and psychological problems." He went into more detail in two of his books, <i>Man's Unfolding</i>, and <i>The Survival of the Wisest</i>. In an interview in 1980, he described his thoughts on the subject, including his feeling that a sharp rise and an expected leveling off in the human population would take place and eventually bring a change in human attitudes:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I think of biological knowledge as providing useful analogies for understanding human nature. . . People think of <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> in terms of such practical matters as drugs, but its contribution to knowledge about living systems and ourselves will in the future be equally important. . . In the past epoch, man was concerned with death, high mortality; his attitudes were antideath, antidisease," he says. "In the future, his attitudes will be expressed in terms of prolife and prohealth. The past was dominated by death control; in the future, birth control will be more important. These changes we're observing are part of a natural order and to be expected from our capacity to adapt. It's much more important to cooperate and collaborate. We are the co-authors with nature of our destiny."<sup id="cite_ref-NYT4-8-80_19-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-NYT4-8-80-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>His definition of a "bio-philosopher" is "Someone who draws upon the scriptures of nature, recognizing that we are the product of the process of evolution, and understands that we have become the process itself, through the emergence and evolution of our consciousness, our awareness, our capacity to imagine and anticipate the future, and to choose from among alternatives."<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The day after his graduation from medical school, Salk married Donna Lindsay, a master's candidate at the New York College of Social Work. David Oshinsky writes that her father, Elmer Lindsay, "a wealthy Manhattan dentist, viewed Salk as a social inferior, several cuts below Donna's former suitors." Eventually, her father agreed to the marriage on two conditions: first, Salk must wait until he could be listed as an official M.D. on the wedding invitations, and second, he must improve his "rather pedestrian status" by giving himself a middle name." <sup id="cite_ref-Oshinsky_1-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oshinsky-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

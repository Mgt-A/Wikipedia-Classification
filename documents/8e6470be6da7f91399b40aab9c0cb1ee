<p><b>Life insurance</b> or <b>life assurance</b> is a contract between the policy owner and the <a href="/wiki/Insurance" title="Insurance">insurer</a>, where the insurer agrees to pay a sum of money upon the occurrence of the insured individual's or individuals' <a href="/wiki/Death" title="Death">death</a> or other event, such as terminal illness or critical illness. In return, the policy owner agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals or in lump sums. There may be designs in some countries where bills and death expenses plus catering for after funeral expenses should be included in Policy Premium. In the United States, the predominant form simply specifies a lump sum to be paid on the insured's demise.</p>
<p>As with most <a href="/wiki/Insurance" title="Insurance">insurance</a> policies, life insurance is a contract between the insurer and the <i>policy owner</i> whereby a benefit is paid to the designated <a href="/wiki/Beneficiary" title="Beneficiary">beneficiaries</a> if an <i>insured event</i> occurs which is covered by the policy.</p>
<p>The value for the policyholder is derived, not from an actual claim event, rather it is the value derived from the 'peace of mind' experienced by the policyholder, due to the negating of adverse financial consequences caused by the death of the Life Assured.</p>
<p>To be a life policy the <i>insured event</i> must be based upon the lives of the people named in the policy.</p>
<p><i>Insured events</i> that may be covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serious <a href="/wiki/Illness" title="Illness">illness</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot and civil commotion.</p>
<p>Life-based contracts tend to fall into two major categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Protection" title="Protection">Protection</a> policies - designed to provide a benefit in the event of specified event, typically a lump sum payment. A common form of this design is term insurance.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Investment" title="Investment">Investment</a> policies - where the main objective is to facilitate the growth of capital by regular or single premiums. Common forms (in the US anyway) are <a href="/wiki/Whole_life_insurance" title="Whole life insurance">whole life</a>, <a href="/wiki/Universal_life_insurance" title="Universal life insurance">universal life</a> and <a href="/wiki/Variable_universal_life_insurance" title="Variable universal life insurance">variable life</a> policies.</li>

<p>There is a difference between the insured and the policy owner (policy holder), although the owner and the insured are often the same person. For example, if Joe buys a policy on his own life, he is both the owner and the insured. But if Jane, his wife, buys a policy on Joe's life, she is the owner and he is the insured. The policy owner is the guarantee and he or she will be the person who will pay for the policy. The insured is a participant in the contract, but not necessarily a party to it.</p>
<p>The beneficiary receives policy proceeds upon the insured's death. The owner designates the beneficiary, but the beneficiary is not a party to the policy. The owner can change the beneficiary unless the policy has an irrevocable beneficiary designation. With an irrevocable beneficiary, that beneficiary must agree to any beneficiary changes, policy assignments, or cash value borrowing.</p>
<p>In cases where the policy owner is not the insured (also referred to as the <i>celui qui vit</i> or CQV), insurance companies have sought to limit policy purchases to those with an "<a href="/wiki/Insurable_interest" title="Insurable interest">insurable interest</a>" in the CQV. For life insurance policies, close family members and business partners will usually be found to have an insurable interest. The "insurable interest" requirement usually demonstrates that the purchaser will actually suffer some kind of loss if the CQV dies. Such a requirement prevents people from benefiting from the purchase of purely speculative policies on people they expect to die. With no insurable interest requirement, the risk that a purchaser would murder the CQV for insurance proceeds would be great. In at least one case, an insurance company which sold a policy to a purchaser with no insurable interest (who later murdered the CQV for the proceeds), was found liable in court for contributing to the <a href="/wiki/Wrongful_death" title="Wrongful death" class="mw-redirect">wrongful death</a> of the victim (Liberty National Life v. Weldon, 267 Ala.171 (1957)).</p>

<ul>
<li>Special provisions may apply, such as suicide clauses wherein the policy becomes null if the insured commits <a href="/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> within a specified time (usually two years after the purchase date; some states provide a statutory one-year suicide clause). Any misrepresentations by the insured on the application is also grounds for nullification. Most US states specify that the contestability period cannot be longer than two years; only if the insured dies within this period will the insurer have a legal right to contest the claim on the basis of misrepresentation and request additional information before deciding to pay or deny the claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>The face amount on the policy is the initial amount that the policy will pay at the death of the insured or when the policy <a href="/wiki/Maturity_(finance)" title="Maturity (finance)">matures</a>, although the actual death benefit can provide for greater or lesser than the face amount. The policy matures when the insured dies or reaches a specified age (such as 100 years old).</p>

<p>The insurer (the life insurance company) calculates the policy prices with intent to fund claims to be paid and administrative costs, and to make a profit. The cost of insurance is determined using mortality tables calculated by <a href="/wiki/Actuary" title="Actuary">actuaries</a>. Actuaries are professionals who employ actuarial science, which is based in mathematics (primarily probability and statistics). Mortality tables are statistically-based tables showing expected annual mortality rates. It is possible to derive life expectancy estimates from these mortality assumptions. Such estimates can be important in taxation regulation.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The three main variables in a mortality table have been age, gender, and use of <a href="/wiki/Tobacco" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>. More recently in the US, preferred class specific tables were introduced. The mortality tables provide a baseline for the cost of insurance. In practice, these mortality tables are used in conjunction with the health and family history of the individual applying for a policy in order to determine premiums and insurability. Mortality tables currently in use by life insurance companies in the United States are individually modified by each company using pooled industry experience studies as a starting point. In the 1980s and 90's the SOA 1975-80 Basic Select &amp; Ultimate tables were the typical reference points, while the 2001 VBT and 2001 CSO tables were published more recently. The newer tables include separate mortality tables for <a href="/wiki/Smoking" title="Smoking">smokers</a> and non-smokers and the CSO tables include separate tables for preferred classes. <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Recent US select mortality tables predict that roughly 0.35 in 1,000 non-smoking males aged 25 will die during the first year of coverage after underwriting.<a href="http://www.actuary.org/life/cso/appendix_a_jun02.xls" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.actuary.org/life/cso/appendix_a_jun02.xls" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Mortality approximately doubles for every extra ten years of age so that the mortality rate in the first year for underwritten non-smoking men is about 2.5 in 1,000 people at age 65.<a href="http://www.actuary.org/life/cso/appendix_a_jun02.xls" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.actuary.org/life/cso/appendix_a_jun02.xls" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Compare this with the US population male mortality rates of 1.3 per 1,000 at age 25 and 19.3 at age 65 (without regard to health or smoking status).<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_14.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_14.pdf" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>The mortality of underwritten persons rises much more quickly than the general population. At the end of 10 years the mortality of that 25 year-old, non-smoking male is 0.66/1000/year. Consequently, in a group of one thousand 25 year old males with a $100,000 policy, all of average health, a life insurance company would have to collect approximately $50 a year from each of a large group to cover the relatively few expected claims. (0.35 to 0.66 expected deaths in each year x $100,000 payout per death = $35 per policy). Administrative and sales commissions need to be accounted for in order for this to make business sense. A 10 year policy for a 25 year old non-smoking male person with preferred medical history may get offers as low as $90 per year for a $100,000 policy in the competitive US life insurance market.</p>
<p>The insurance company receives the premiums from the policy owner and invests them to create a pool of money from which it can pay claims and finance the insurance company's operations. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of the money that insurance companies make comes directly from premiums paid, as money gained through investment of premiums can never, in even the most ideal market conditions, vest enough money per year to pay out claims.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Rates charged for life insurance increase with the insurer's age because, statistically, people are more likely to die as they get older.</p>
<p>Given that adverse selection can have a negative impact on the insurer's financial situation, the insurer investigates each proposed insured individual unless the policy is below a company-established minimum amount, beginning with the application process. <a href="/wiki/Group_Insurance" title="Group Insurance" class="mw-redirect">Group Insurance</a> policies are an exception.</p>
<p>This investigation and resulting evaluation of the risk is termed <a href="/wiki/Underwriting" title="Underwriting">underwriting</a>. <a href="/wiki/Medical_Underwriting" title="Medical Underwriting" class="mw-redirect">Health</a> and lifestyle questions are asked. Certain responses or information received may merit further investigation. Life insurance companies in the United States support the Medical Information Bureau (MIB) <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>, which is a clearinghouse of information on persons who have applied for life insurance with participating companies in the last seven years. As part of the application, the insurer receives permission to obtain information from the proposed insured's physicians.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Underwriters will determine the purpose of insurance. The most common is to protect the owner's family or financial interests in the event of the insurer's demise. Other purposes include estate planning or, in the case of cash-value contracts, investment for retirement planning. Bank loans or buy-sell provisions of business agreements are another acceptable purpose.</p>
<p>Life insurance companies are never required by law to underwrite or to provide coverage to anyone, with the exception of <a href="/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act" title="Civil Rights Act">Civil Rights Act</a> compliance requirements.

INSURANCE VS ASSURANCE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The specific uses of the terms "insurance" and "assurance" are sometimes confused. In general, in these jurisdictions "insurance" refers to providing cover for an event that might happen (fire, theft, flood, etc.), while "assurance" is the provision of cover for an event that is certain to happen. "Insurance" is the generally accepted term, however, people using this description are liable to be corrected. In the United States both forms of coverage are called "insurance", principally due to many companies offering both types of policy, and rather than refer to themselves using both insurance and assurance titles, they instead use just one.</p>

<p>Life insurance may be divided into two basic classes – temporary and permanent or following subclasses - term, universal, whole life and endowment life insurance.</p>
<p>TEMPORARY TERM</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Term assurance: provides for life insurance coverage for a specified term of years for a specified <a href="/wiki/Premium" title="Premium">premium</a>. The policy does not accumulate cash value. Term is generally considered "pure" insurance, where the premium buys protection in the event of death and nothing else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The three key factors to be considered in term insurance are: face amount (protection or death benefit), premium to be paid (cost to the insured), and length of coverage (term).</p>
<p>Various insurance companies sell term insurance with many different combinations of these three parameters. The face amount can remain constant or decline. The term can be for one or more years. The premium can remain level or increase. A common type of term is called annual renewable term. It is a one year policy but the insurance company guarantees it will issue a policy of equal or lesser amount without regard to the insurability of the insured and with a premium set for the insured's age at that time. Another common type of term insurance is <a href="/wiki/Mortgage_insurance" title="Mortgage insurance">mortgage insurance</a>, which is usually a level premium, declining face value policy. The face amount is intended to equal the amount of the mortgage on the policy owner’s residence so the mortgage will be paid if the insured dies.</p>
<p>A policy holder insures his life for a specified term. If he dies before that specified term is up, his estate or named beneficiary receives a payout. If he does not die before the term is up, he receives nothing. In the past these policies would almost always exclude suicide. However, after a number of court judgments against the industry, payouts do occur on death by suicide (presumably except for in the unlikely case that it can be shown that the suicide was just to benefit from the policy). Generally, if an insured person commits suicide within the first two policy years, the insurer will return the premiums paid. However, a death benefit will usually be paid if the suicide occurs after the two year period.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Life_insurance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Permanent Life Insurance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Permanent Life Insurance</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wiki/Permanent_life_insurance" title="Permanent life insurance">Permanent life insurance</a> is life insurance that remains in force (in-line) until the policy matures (pays out), unless the owner fails to pay the premium when due (the policy expires OR policies lapse). The policy cannot be canceled by the insurer for any reason except fraud in the application, and that cancellation must occur within a period of time defined by law (usually two years). Permanent insurance builds a cash value that reduces the amount at risk to the insurance company and thus the insurance expense over time. This means that a policy with a million dollar face value can be relatively expensive to a 70 year old. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value.</p>
<p>The four basic types of permanent insurance are <b>whole life</b>, <b>universal life</b>, limited pay and <b>endowment</b>.</p>
<p><a name="Whole_life_coverage" id="Whole_life_coverage"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Life_insurance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Whole life coverage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Whole life coverage</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Whole_life_insurance" title="Whole life insurance">Whole life insurance</a> provides for a level premium, and a cash value table included in the policy guaranteed by the company. The primary advantages of whole life are guaranteed death benefits, guaranteed cash values, fixed and known annual premiums, and mortality and expense charges will not reduce the cash value shown in the policy. The primary disadvantages of whole life are premium inflexibility, and the internal rate of return in the policy may not be competitive with other savings alternatives. Riders are available that can allow one to increase the death benefit by paying additional premium. The death benefit can also be increased through the use of policy dividends. Dividends cannot be guaranteed and may be higher or lower than historical rates over time. Premiums are much higher than term insurance in the short-term, but cumulative premiums are roughly equal if policies are kept in force until average life expectancy.</p>
<p>Cash value can be accessed at any time through policy "loans". Since these loans decrease the death benefit if not paid back, payback is optional. Cash values are not paid to the beneficiary upon the death of the insured; the beneficiary receives the death benefit only. If the dividend option: Paid up additions is elected, dividend cash values will purchase additional death benefit which will increase the death benefit of the policy to the named beneficiary.</p>
<p><a name="Universal_life_coverage" id="Universal_life_coverage"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Life_insurance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Universal life coverage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Universal life coverage</span></h4>
<p><a href="/wiki/Universal_life_insurance" title="Universal life insurance">Universal life insurance</a> (UL) is a relatively new insurance product intended to provide permanent insurance coverage with greater flexibility in premium payment and the potential for a higher internal rate of return. There are several types of universal life insurance policies which include "interest sensitive" (also known as "traditional fixed universal life insurance"), variable universal life insurance, and equity indexed universal life insurance.</p>
<p>A universal life insurance policy includes a cash account. Premiums increase the cash account. Interest is paid within the policy (credited) on the account at a rate specified by the company. Mortality charges and administrative costs are then charged against (reduce) the cash account. The surrender value of the policy is the amount remaining in the cash account less applicable surrender charges, if any.</p>
<p>With all life insurance, there are basically two functions that make it work. There's a mortality function and a cash function. The mortality function would be the classical notion of pooling risk where the premiums paid by everybody else would cover the death benefit for the one or two who will die for a given period of time. The cash function inherent in all life insurance says that if a person is to reach age 95 to 100 (the age varies depending on state and company), then the policy matures and endows the face value of the policy.</p>
<p>Actuarially, it is reasoned that out of a group of 1000 people, if even 10 of them live to age 95, then the mortality function alone will not be able to cover the cash function. So in order to cover the cash function, a minimum rate of investment return on the premiums will be required in the event that a policy matures.</p>
<p>Universal life insurance addresses the perceived disadvantages of whole life. Premiums are flexible. Depending on how interest is credited, the internal rate of return can be higher because it moves with prevailing interest rates (interest-sensitive) or the financial markets (Equity Indexed Universal Life and Variable Universal Life). Mortality costs and administrative charges are known. And cash value may be considered more easily attainable because the owner can discontinue premiums if the cash value allows it. And universal life has a more flexible death benefit because the owner can select one of two death benefit options, Option A and Option B.</p>
<p>Option A pays the face amount at death as it's designed to have the cash value equal the death benefit at maturity (usually at age 95 or 100). With each premium payment, the policy owner is reducing the cost of insurance until the cash value reaches the face amount upon maturity.</p>
<p>Option B pays the face amount plus the cash value, as it's designed to increase the net death benefit as cash values accumulate. Option B offers the benefit of an increasing death benefit every year that the policy stays in force. The drawback to option B is that because the cash value is accumulated "on top of" the death benefit, the cost of insurance never decreases as premium payments are made. Thus, as the insured gets older, the policy owner is faced with an ever increasing cost of insurance (it costs more money to provide the same initial face amount of insurance as the insured gets older).</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Endowment_policy" title="Endowment policy">Endowments</a> are policies in which the cash value built up inside the policy, equals the death benefit (face amount) at a certain age. The age this commences is known as the endowment age. Endowments are considerably more expensive (in terms of annual premiums) than either whole life or universal life because the premium paying period is shortened and the endowment date is earlier.</p>
<p>In the United States, the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Technical_Corrections_Act_of_1988&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Technical Corrections Act of 1988 (page does not exist)">Technical Corrections Act of 1988</a> tightened the rules on tax shelters (creating <a href="/wiki/Endowment_policy" title="Endowment policy">modified endowments</a>).

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Life_insurance&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Accidental Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Accidental Death</span></h3>
<p>Accidental death is a limited life insurance that is designed to cover the insured when they pass away due to an accident. Accidents include anything from an injury, but do not typically cover any deaths resulting from health problems or suicide. Because they only cover accidents, these policies are much less expensive than other life insurances.</p>
<p>It is also very commonly offered as "<a href="/wiki/Accidental_death_and_dismemberment_insurance" title="Accidental death and dismemberment insurance">accidental death and dismemberment insurance</a>", also known as an <i>AD&amp;D</i> policy. In an <i>AD&amp;D</i> policy, benefits are available not only for accidental death, but also for loss of limbs or bodily functions such as sight and hearing, etc.</p>
<p>Accidental death and <i>AD&amp;D</i> policies <b>very rarely pay</b> a benefit; either the cause of death is not covered, or the coverage is not maintained after the accident until death occurs. To be aware of what coverage they have, an insured should always review their policy for what it covers and what it excludes. Often, it does not cover an insured who puts themselves at risk in activities such as: parachuting, flying an airplane, professional sports, or involvement in a war (military or not). Also, some insurers will exclude death and injury caused by proximate causes due to (but not limited to) racing on wheels and mountaineering.</p>
<p>Accidental death benefits can also be added to a standard life insurance policy as a rider. If this rider is purchased, the policy will generally pay double the face amount if the insured dies due to an accident. This used to be commonly referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Double_indemnity" title="Double indemnity">double indemnity</a> coverage. In some cases, some companies may even offer a triple indemnity cover.</p>

<p>Riders are modifications to the insurance policy added at the same time the policy is issued. These riders change the basic policy to provide some feature desired by the policy owner. A common rider is accidental death, which used to be commonly referred to as "double indemnity", which pays twice the amount of the policy face value if death results from accidental causes, as if both a full coverage policy and an accidental death policy were in effect on the insured. Another common rider is premium waiver, which waives future premiums if the insured becomes disabled.</p>
<p>Joint life: insurance is either a term or permanent policy insuring two or more lives with the proceeds payable on the first death.</p>
<p>Survivorship life: is a whole life policy insuring two lives with the proceeds payable on the second (later) death.</p>
<p>Single premium whole life: is a policy with only one premium which is payable at the time the policy is issued.</p>
<p>Modified whole life: is a whole life policy that charges smaller premiums for a specified period of time after which the premiums increase for the remainder of the policy.</p>
<p>Group life insurance: is term insurance covering a group of people, usually employees of a company or members of a union or association. Individual proof of insurability is not normally a consideration in the underwriting. Rather, the underwriter considers the size and turnover of the group, and the financial strength of the group. Contract provisions will attempt to exclude the possibility of adverse selection. Group life insurance often has a provision that a member exiting the group has the right to buy individual insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Senior and preneed productS: Insurance companies have in recent years developed products to offer to niche markets, most notably targeting the <b>senior</b> market to address needs of an aging population. Many companies offer policies tailored to the needs of senior applicants. These are often low to moderate face value whole life insurance policies, to allow a senior citizen purchasing insurance at an older issue age an opportunity to buy affordable insurance. This may also be marketed as <b>final expense insurance</b>, and an agent or company may suggest (but not require) that the policy proceeds could be used for end-of-life expenses.</p>
<p>Preneed (or prepaid) insurance policies: are whole life policies that, although available at any age, are usually offered to older applicants as well. This type of insurance is designed specifically to cover <a href="/wiki/Funeral" title="Funeral">funeral</a> expenses when the insured person dies. In many cases, the applicant signs a prefunded funeral arrangement with a <a href="/wiki/Funeral_home" title="Funeral home">funeral home</a> at the time the policy is applied for. The death proceeds are then guaranteed to be directed first to the funeral services provider for payment of services rendered. Most contracts dictate that any excess proceeds will go either to the insured's estate or a designated beneficiary.</p>

<p>Premiums paid by the policy owner are normally not deductible for federal and state <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" title="Income tax">income tax</a> purposes.</p>
<p>Proceeds paid by the insurer upon death of the insured are not included in gross income for federal and state income tax purposes;<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> however, if the proceeds are included in the "estate" of the deceased, it is likely they will be subject to federal and state <a href="/wiki/Estate_tax_(United_States)" title="Estate tax (United States)" class="mw-redirect">estate and inheritance tax</a>.</p>
<p>Cash value increases within the policy are not subject to income taxes unless certain events occur. For this reason, insurance policies can be a legal and legitimate <a href="/wiki/Tax_shelter" title="Tax shelter">tax shelter</a> wherein savings can increase without taxation until the owner withdraws the money from the policy. On flexible-premium policies, large deposits of premium could cause the contract to be considered a "Modified Endowment Contract" by the <a href="/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service" title="Internal Revenue Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS), which negates many of the tax advantages associated with life insurance. The insurance company, in most cases, will inform the policy owner of this danger before applying their premium.</p>
<p>Tax deferred benefit from a life insurance policy may be offset by its low return in some cases. This depends upon the insuring company, type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Also, other income tax saving vehicles (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Individual_Retirement_Account" title="Individual Retirement Account">Individual Retirement Account</a> (IRA), <a href="/wiki/401K" title="401K" class="mw-redirect">401K</a> or <a href="/wiki/Roth_IRA" title="Roth IRA">Roth IRA</a>) may be better alternatives for value accumulation. This will depend on the individual and their specific circumstances.</p>

<p>Premiums are not usually allowable against <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" title="Income tax">income tax</a> or <a href="/wiki/Corporation_tax" title="Corporation tax" class="mw-redirect">corporation tax</a>, however qualifying policies issued prior to 14 March 1984 do still attract LAPR (<a href="/wiki/Life_Assurance_Premium_Relief" title="Life Assurance Premium Relief" class="mw-redirect">Life Assurance Premium Relief</a>) at 15% (with the net premium being collected from the policyholder).</p>
<p>Non-investment life policies do not normally attract either income tax or <a href="/wiki/Capital_gains_tax" title="Capital gains tax">capital gains tax</a> on claim. If the policy has as investment element such as an endowment policy, whole of life policy or an investment bond then the tax treatment is determined by the qualifying status of the policy.</p>
<p>Qualifying status is determined at the outset of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10 years plus) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" title="Income tax">income tax</a> and <a href="/wiki/Capital_gains_tax" title="Capital gains tax">capital gains tax</a>. Single premium contracts and those run for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon your marginal rate in the year you make a gain. All (UK) insurers pay a special rate of <a href="/wiki/Corporation_tax" title="Corporation tax" class="mw-redirect">corporation tax</a> on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) liability for policyholders. Therefore a policyholder who is a higher rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called <a href="/w/index.php?title=Top-slicing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Top-slicing (page does not exist)">top-slicing</a> based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes (<a href="/wiki/Unit_trust" title="Unit trust">unit trusts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Investment_trust" title="Investment trust">investment trusts</a> and <a href="/wiki/OEIC" title="OEIC" class="mw-redirect">OEICs</a>). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the '5% cumulative allowance' – the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the <a href="/wiki/HMRC" title="HMRC" class="mw-redirect">HMRC</a> (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful tax planning tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future (e.g. retirement), as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.</p>
<p>The proceeds of a life policy will be included in the estate for <a href="/wiki/Death_duty" title="Death duty" class="mw-redirect">death duty</a> (in the UK, <a href="/wiki/Inheritance_tax" title="Inheritance tax">inheritance tax</a> (IHT)) purposes, except that policies written in <a href="/wiki/Trust_law" title="Trust law">trust</a> may fall outside the estate. Trust law and taxation of trusts can be complicated, so any individual intending to use trusts for tax planning would usually seek professional advice from an <a href="/wiki/Independent_Financial_Adviser" title="Independent Financial Adviser">Independent Financial Adviser</a> (IFA) and/or a <a href="/wiki/Solicitor" title="Solicitor">solicitor</a>.</p>

<p>Although available before April 2006, from this date <a href="/wiki/Pension_term_assurance" title="Pension term assurance">pension term assurance</a> became widely available in the UK. Most UK product providers adopted the name "life insurance with tax relief" for the product. <a href="/wiki/Pension_term_assurance" title="Pension term assurance">Pension term assurance</a> is effectively normal term life assurance with tax relief on the premiums. All premiums are paid net of basic rate tax at 22%, and higher rate tax payers can gain an extra 18% tax relief via their tax return. Although not suitable for all, PTA briefly became one of the most common forms of life assurance sold in the UK until the Chancellor, <a href="/wiki/Gordon_Brown" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, announced the withdrawal of the scheme in his pre-budget announcement on 6 December 2006. The tax relief ceased to be available to new policies transacted after 6 December 2006, however, existing policies have been allowed to enjoy tax relief so far.</p>

<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/History_of_insurance" title="History of insurance">History of insurance</a></div>
<p>Insurance began as a way of reducing the risk of traders, as early as 5000 BC in <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> and 4500 BC in <a href="/wiki/Babylon" title="Babylon">Babylon</a>. Life insurance dates only to ancient Rome; "burial clubs" covered the cost of members' funeral expenses and helped survivors monetarily. Modern life insurance started in late 17th century <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, originally as insurance for traders: merchants, ship owners and underwriters met to discuss deals at Lloyd's Coffee House, predecessor to the famous <a href="/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London" title="Lloyd's of London">Lloyd's of London</a>.</p>
<p>The first insurance company in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> was formed in <a href="/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a> in 1732, but it provided only fire insurance. The sale of life insurance in the U.S. began in the late 1760s. The <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian" title="Presbyterian" class="mw-redirect">Presbyterian</a> Synods in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> created the Corporation for Relief of Poor and Distressed Widows and Children of Presbyterian Ministers in 1759; <a href="/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America" class="mw-redirect">Episcopalian</a> priests organized a similar fund in 1769. Between 1787 and 1837 more than two dozen life insurance companies were started, but fewer than half a dozen survived.</p>
<p>Prior to the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, many insurance companies in the United States <a href="/wiki/Slave_insurance_in_America" title="Slave insurance in America">insured the lives of slaves</a> for their owners. In response to bills passed in <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> in 2001 and in <a href="/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> in 2003, the companies have been required to search their records for such policies. <a href="/wiki/New_York_Life_Insurance_Company" title="New York Life Insurance Company">New York Life</a> for example reported that Nautilus sold 485 slaveholder life insurance policies during a two-year period in the 1840s; they added that their trustees voted to end the sale of such policies 15 years before the <a href="/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>.</p>

<p>Although some aspects of the application process (such as underwriting and insurable interest provisions) make it difficult, life insurance policies have been used in cases of exploitation and fraud. In the case of life insurance, there is a motivation to purchase a life insurance policy, particularly if the face value is substantial, and then kill the insured. Usually, the larger the claim, and/or the more serious the incident, the larger and more intense will be the number of investigative layers, consisting in police and insurer investigation, eventually also <a href="/wiki/Loss_adjuster" title="Loss adjuster" class="mw-redirect">loss adjusters</a> hired by the insurers to work independently.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Television_series" title="Television series" class="mw-redirect">television series</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Forensic_Files" title="Forensic Files">Forensic Files</a></i> has included episodes that feature this scenario. There was also a documented case in 2006, where two elderly women are accused of taking in homeless men and assisting them. As part of their assistance, they took out life insurance on the men. After the contestability period ended on the policies (most life contracts have a standard contestability period of two years), the women are alleged to have had the men killed via hit-and-run car crashes.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Recently, <a href="/wiki/Viatical_settlement" title="Viatical settlement">viatical settlements</a> have thrown the life insurance industry into turmoil. A viatical settlement involves the purchase of a life insurance policy from an elderly or terminally ill policy holder. The policy holder sells the policy (including the right to name the beneficiary) to a purchaser for a price discounted from the policy value. The seller has cash in hand, and the purchaser will realize a profit when the seller dies and the proceeds are delivered to the purchaser. In the meantime, the purchaser continues to pay the premiums. Although both parties have reached an agreeable settlement, insurers are troubled by this trend. Insurers calculate their rates with the assumption that a certain portion of policy holders will seek to redeem the cash value of their insurance policies before death. They also expect that a certain portion will stop paying premiums and forfeit their policies. However, viatical settlements ensure that such policies will with absolute certainty be paid out. Some purchasers, in order to take advantage of the potentially large profits, have even actively sought to collude with uninsured elderly and terminally ill patients, and created policies that would have not otherwise been purchased. Likewise, these policies are guaranteed losses from the insurers' perspective.</p>
<p>The criticism goes also in the direction of pointing out much lower payouts for life insurance than for <a href="/wiki/Health_insurance" title="Health insurance">health</a> or <a href="/wiki/Disability_insurance" title="Disability insurance">disability insurance</a> in some countries (for example, <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><b>Cryptic crosswords</b> are <a href="/wiki/Crossword" title="Crossword">crossword puzzles</a> of a special type: one in which each clue is a word puzzle in and of itself. Cryptic crosswords are particularly popular in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, where they originated, as well as in several other <a href="/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth</a> nations, including <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kenya" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malta" title="Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>, cryptics are sometimes known as "British-style" crosswords. For the most part, they are an <a href="/wiki/English-language" title="English-language" class="mw-redirect">English-language</a> phenomenon, although similar puzzles are popular in a <a href="/wiki/Hebrew_language" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> form in <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> (where they are called <i>tashbetsey higayon</i> "Logic crosswords")<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> and (as <i>Cryptogrammen</i>) in <a href="/wiki/Dutch_language" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>. In Poland similar crosswords are called "<a href="/wiki/Hetman" title="Hetman">Hetman</a> crosswords". 'Hetman', a senior commander, and also the informal name for a <a href="/wiki/Queen_(chess)" title="Queen (chess)">queen</a> in <a href="/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">Chess</a>, emphasises their importance over other crosswords.</p>
<p>Cryptic crossword puzzles come in two main types: the basic cryptic in which each clue answer is entered into the diagram normally, and the advanced or "variety" cryptic, in which some or all of the answers must be altered before entering, usually in accordance with a hidden pattern or rule which must be discovered by the solver.</p>

<p>In essence, a cryptic clue leads to its answer as long as you read it in the right way. What the clue appears to say when read normally (the <i>surface reading</i>) is a distraction and usually has nothing to do with the clue answer. The challenge is to find the way of reading the clue that leads to the solution.</p>
<p>A typical clue gives you two ways of getting to the answer, either of which can come first. One part of the clue is a definition, which must exactly match the <a href="/wiki/Part_of_speech" title="Part of speech" class="mw-redirect">part of speech</a> and tense of the answer. The other part (the <i>subsidiary indication</i>, or <i>wordplay</i>) gives you an alternative route to the answer. (A second definition in the case of double definition clues.) One of the tasks of the solver is to find the boundary between definition and wordplay and insert a mental pause there when reading the clue <i>cryptically</i>. (Sometimes the two parts are joined with a link word or phrase such as "from" or "could be".)</p>
<p>Because a typical cryptic clue describes its answer in detail and often more than once, the solver can usually have a great deal of confidence in the answer once it has been determined. This is in contrast to non-cryptic crossword clues which often have several possible answers and force the solver to use the crossing letters to distinguish which was intended.</p>
<p>Here is an example (taken from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i> crossword of Aug 6 2002, set by "Shed").</p>
<dl>
<dd>15D <i>Very sad unfinished story about rising smoke (8)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>is a clue for <small>TRAGICAL</small>. This breaks down as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>15D indicates the location and direction (down) of the solution in the grid</li>
<li>"Very sad" is the definition</li>
<li>"unfinished story" gives "tal" ("tale" with one letter missing, i.e. "unfinished")</li>
<li>"rising smoke" gives "ragic" (a "cigar" is a smoke and this is a down clue so "rising" indicates that "cigar" should be written up the page, i.e. backwards)</li>
<li>"about" means that the letters of "tal" should be put either side of "ragic", giving "tragical"</li>
<li>"(8)" says that the answer is a single word of eight letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many "code words" or "indicators" that have a special meaning in the cryptic crossword context. (In the example above, "about", "unfinished" and "rising" all fall into this category). Learning these, or being able to spot them, is a useful and necessary part of becoming a skilled cryptic crossword solver.</p>
<p><a href="#Compilers" title="">Compilers</a> or setters often use slang terms and abbreviations, generally without indication, so familiarity with these can be useful. Also words that can mean more than one thing are commonly exploited: often the meaning the solver must use is completely different from the one it appears to have in the clue. Some examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bloomer - often means flower (a thing that blooms).</li>
<li>Flower - often means river (a thing that flows).</li>
<li>Lead - could be the metal, an electric cable, or the verb.</li>
<li>Novel - could be a book, or a word for new, or a code-word indicating an anagram.</li>
<li>Permit - could be a noun (meaning licence) or a verb (meaning allow).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these examples, "flower" is an invented meaning by back-formation from the -er suffix, which cannot be confirmed in a standard dictionary. A similar trick is played in the old clue "A wicked thing" for CANDLE, where the -ed suffix must be understood in its "equipped with a ...." meaning. In the case of the -er suffix, this trick could be played with other meanings of the suffix, but except for river=&gt;BANKER (a river is not a 'thing that banks' but a 'thing that has banks'), this is rarely done.</p>

A lattice-style grid common for cryptic crosswords</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A typical cryptic crossword grid is generally 15x15, with half-turn rotational symmetry. Unlike typical American <a href="/wiki/Crosswords" title="Crosswords" class="mw-redirect">crosswords</a>, the grid entries are not "fully checked"; instead, roughly half the letters in each entry are checked. Checked squares are those in at least two answers; squares used in only one answer are sometimes called "unches". In most daily newspaper cryptic crosswords, grid designs are restricted to a set of stock grids. In the past this was mainly because 'hot-metal' printing meant that new grids were expensive, but nowadays, it seems to be used as a way of making sure that grids conform to the preferences of a paper's crossword editor. Some papers have additional grid rules - at The Times, for example, all words have at least half the letters checked, and although words can have two unches in succession, they cannot be the first two or last two letters of a word. The grid shown here breaks one Times grid rule - the 15-letter words at 9 and 24 across each have 8 letters unchecked out of 15. The Independent allows setters to use their own grid designs.</p>
<p>Variety (UK: "advanced") cryptic crosswords typically use a "barred grid" with no black squares and a slightly smaller size - 12x12 is typical. Word boundaries are denoted by thick lines called "bars". In these variety puzzles, one or more clues may require modification to fit into the grid, such as dropping or adding a letter, or being anagrammed to fit other, unmodified clues; unclued spaces may spell out a secret message appropriate for the puzzle theme once the puzzle is fully solved. The solver also may need to determine where answers fit into the grid.</p>
<p>A July 2006 "Puzzlecraft" section in <a href="/wiki/Games_Magazine" title="Games Magazine" class="mw-redirect">Games Magazine</a> on cryptic crossword construction noted that for cryptic crosswords to be readily solvable, no fewer than half the letters for every word should be checked by another word for a standard cryptic crossword, while nearly every letter should be checked for a variety cryptic crossword. In most UK "advanced cryptics" ('variety cryptic'), at least three-quarters of the letters in each word are checked.</p>

<p>There are notable differences between British and North American (including Canadian) cryptics. American cryptics are thought of as holding to a more rigid set of construction rules than British ones. American cryptics usually require all words in a clue to be used in service of the wordplay or definition, whereas British ones allow for more extraneous or supporting words. In American cryptics, a clue is only allowed to have one subsidiary indication, but in British cryptics the occasional clue may have more than one e.g. a <i>triple definition</i> clue would be considered an amusing variation in the UK but unsound in the US.</p>

<p>Clues given to the solver are based on various forms of wordplay. Nearly every clue has two non-overlapping parts to it - one part that provides an unmodified but often indirect definition for the word or phrase, and a second part that includes the wordplay involved. In a few cases, the two definitions are one and the same, as often in the case of <a href="#.22.26_lit..22" title="">"&amp; lit."</a> clues. Most cryptic crosswords provide the number of letters in the answer, or in the case of phrases, a series of numbers to denote the letters in each word; "cryptic crossword" would be clued with "(7,9)" following the clue. More advanced puzzles may drop this portion of the clue.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Cryptic_crossword&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Cryptic Definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cryptic Definition</span></h3>
<p>Here the clue appears to say one thing, but with a slight shift of viewpoint it says another. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A word of praise? (8)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>would give the answer <small>ALLELUIA</small>, a word used by Christians to praise God, but not what first springs to mind on reading the clue. Notice the question mark - this is often (though by no means always) used by compilers to indicate this sort of clue is one where you need to interpret the words in a different fashion. The way that a clue reads as an ordinary sentence is called its <i>surface reading</i> and is often used to disguise the need for a different interpretation of the clue's component words.</p>
<p>Another one might be:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The flower of London?</i> (6)</dd>
</dl>
<p>which gives <small>THAMES</small>, a flow-er of London. Here, the surface reading suggests a flower, which disguises the fact that the name of a river is required.</p>
<p>This type of clue rarely appears in American cryptics but is common in British and Canadian cryptics. It's almost certainly the oldest kind of cryptic clue: cryptic definitions appeared in the UK newspaper puzzles in the late 1920s and early 1930s that mixed cryptic and plain definition clues and evolved into fully cryptic crosswords.</p>
<p><a name="Double_definition" id="Double_definition"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Cryptic_crossword&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Double definition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Double definition</span></h3>
<p>A clue may, rather than having a definition part and a wordplay part, have two definition parts. Thus:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Not seeing window covering (5)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>would have the answer <small>BLIND</small>, because <i>blind</i> can mean both "not seeing" and "window covering". Note that since these definitions come from the same root word, an American magazine might not allow this clue. American double definitions tend to require both parts to come from different roots, as in this clue:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Eastern European buff (6)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This takes advantage of the two very different meanings (and pronunciations) of <small>POLISH</small>, the one with the long "o" sound meaning "someone from Poland" and the one with the short "o" sound meaning "make shiny".</p>
<p>These clues tend to be short; in particular, two-word clues are almost always double-definition clues.</p>
<p>In the UK, multiple definitions are occasionally used, e.g.:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Burn milk making hot drink for clergyman (6)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>is a triple definition of <small>BISHOP</small> ("mulled red wine flavoured with bitter oranges" or "to burn milk in cooking") <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> but in the US this would be considered unsound.</p>
<p>Some British newspapers have an affection for quirky clues of this kind where the two definitions are similar:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Let in or let on (5)</i> - <small>ADMIT</small></dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that these clues do not have clear indicator words.</p>
<p><a name="Hidden_words" id="Hidden_words"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Cryptic_crossword&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Hidden words">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hidden words</span></h3>
<p>When the answer appears in the clue but is contained within one or more words, it is hidden. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Found ermine, deer hides damaged (10)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>gives <small>UNDERMINED</small>, which means (cryptically at least) "damaged" and can be found as part of "Fo<b>und ermine d</b>eer". The word "hides" is used to mean "contains," but in the surface sense suggests "pelts".</p>
<p>Possible indicators of a hidden clue are "in part", "partially", "in", "within", "hides", "conceals", "some", and "held by".</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Introduction to do-gooder canine (3)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>gives <small>DOG</small>, which is the first part of, or "introduction to", the word "do-gooder", and means "canine".</p>
<p><a name="Reversals" id="Reversals"></a></p>

<p>A word that gets turned around to make another is a reversal. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Returned beer fit for a king (5)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer is <small>REGAL</small>. "Lager" (i.e., "beer") is "returned" to make <i>regal</i>.</p>
<p>Other indicator words include "receding", "in the mirror", "going the wrong way", "returns", "reverses" "to the left" or "left" (for across clues), and "rising", "overturned" or "mounted" or "comes up" (for down clues).</p>
<p><a name="Hidden_backwards" id="Hidden_backwards"></a></p>

<p>Sometimes the above two clue types are combined. A word may be hidden backwards, such as in the clue:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Cruel to turn part of internet torrid (6)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer to this clue is <small>ROTTEN</small>. The phrase "to turn" indicates "to reverse," and "part of" suggests a piece of "internet torrid".</p>

<p>Here the answer is formed by joining individually clued words to make a larger word (namely, the answer).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Outlaw leader managing money (7)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer is <small>BANKING</small> formed by <small>BAN</small> for "outlaw" and <small>KING</small> for "leader". The definition is "managing money". With this example, the words go next to each other in the clue as they do in the answer--it isn't specifically indicated. However, where the parts go in relation to others is sometimes indicated with words such as "against", "after", "on", "with" or (in a down clue) "above".</p>

<p>A container clue puts one set of letters inside another. So:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Apostle's friend outside of university (4)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>gives <small>PAUL</small> ("apostle"), by placing "pal" ("friend") outside of "U" ("university").</p>
<p>Other container indicators are "inside", "over", "around", "clutching", "enters", and the like.</p>
<p><a name="Anagrams" id="Anagrams"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Cryptic_crossword&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Anagrams">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anagrams</span></h3>
<p>An <a href="/wiki/Anagram" title="Anagram">anagram</a> is a rearrangement of a certain section of the clue to form the answer. This is usually indicated by words such as 'strange', 'bizarre', 'muddled', 'wild', 'drunk', or any other term indicating change. One example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Chaperone shredded corset (6)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>gives <small>ESCORT</small>, which means <i>chaperone</i> and is an anagram of <i>corset</i>, indicated by the word <i>shredded</i>.</p>
<p>Anagram clues are characterized by an indicator word adjacent to a phrase that has the same number of letters as the answer. The indicator tells the solver that there is an <a href="/wiki/Anagram" title="Anagram">anagram</a> they need to solve in order to work out the answer. Indicators come either before or after the letters to be anagrammed. In an American cryptic, only the words given in the clue may be anagrammed; in some older puzzles, the words to be anagrammed may be clued and <i>then</i> anagrammed. So in this clue:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Chew honeydew fruit (5)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Chew</i> is the anagram indicator; <i>honeydew</i> clues <i>melon</i>, which is to be anagrammed; and <i>fruit</i> is the definition for the answer, <small>LEMON</small>. This kind of clue is called an <i>indirect anagram</i>, which in the vast majority of cryptic crosswords are not used, ever since they were criticised by 'Ximenes' in his 1966 book 'On the Art of the Crossword'. Minor exception: Simple abbreviations may be used to spice up the process, e.g., "Husband, a most eccentric fellow" (6) for THOMAS, where the anagram is made from A, MOST, and H = husband.</p>
<p>Anagram indicators, among the thousands possible, include: abstract, absurd, alien, alternative, at sea, awkward, bad, barmy, blend, blow, break, careless, chaotic, clumsy, contrived, convert, corrupt, develop, doctor, eccentric, engineer, fabricate, fake, fix, foolish, fudge, ground, hammer, hybrid, in a tizzy, jostle, knead, loose, maybe, messy, mix, mutant, new, novel, odd, order, out, outrageous, peculiar, poor, questionable, remodel, resort, rough, sort, strange, style, tricky, troubled, twist, unconventional, unsound, vary.</p>
<p>It is common for the setter to use a juxtaposition of anagram indicator and anagram that form a common phrase in order to make the clue appear as much like a 'normal' sentence or phrase as possible. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Lap dancing friend (3)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>uses <i>dancing</i> as the indicator as it fits cohesively with <i>lap</i> to give the solution, <small>PAL</small>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Cryptic_crossword&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Homophones">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Homophones</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Homophone" title="Homophone">Homophones</a> are words that sound the same but have different meanings, such as "night" and "knight". Homophone clues always have an indicator word or phrase that has to do with phonetics, such as "reportedly", "they say", "utterly", "vocal", "to the audience", "by the sound of it", and "is heard".</p>
<p>An example of a homophone clue is</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>We hear twins shave (4)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>which is a clue for <small>PARE</small>, which means "shave" and is a homophone of pair, or "twins". The homophone is indicated by "we hear".</p>
<p>If the two words are the same length, the clue should be phrased in such a way that only one of them can be the answer. This is usually done by having the homophone indicator adjacent to the word that is not the definition; therefore, in the previous example, "we hear" was adjacent to "twins" and the answer was <i>pare</i> rather than <i>pair</i>. The indicator could come between the words if they were of different lengths and the enumeration was given, such as in the case of "right" and "rite".</p>
<p><a name="Initialisms" id="Initialisms"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Cryptic_crossword&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Edit section: Initialisms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Initialisms</span></h3>
<p>In an initialism clue, the first letters of part of the clue are put together to give the answer.</p>
<p>An example of an initialism:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Initially amiable person eats primate (3)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer would be <small>APE</small>, which is a type of primate. "Initially" signals that you must take the first letters of "amiable person eats"--"ape".</p>
<p>Another example would be:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>At first, actor needing new identity emulates orphan in musical theatre (5)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer would be <small>ANNIE</small>, the name of a famous orphan in musical theatre. This is obtained from the first letters of "actor needing new identity emulates".</p>
<p>Words that indicate initialisms also include "firstly" and "to start".</p>
<p>It is possible to have initialisms just for certain parts of the clue. It is also possible to employ the same technique to the end of words. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Old country lady went round Head Office initially before end of day (7)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer would be <small>DAHOMEY</small>, which used to be a kingdom in Africa (an "old country"). Here, we take the first letters of only the words "Head Office" (ho) and we take the "end" of the word "day" (y). The letters of the word "dame", meaning "lady", are then made to go around the letters "ho" to form Dahomey.</p>

<p>An odd/even clue is one in which the odd or even letters of certain parts of the clue give the answer. An example is:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Odd stuff of Mr. Waugh is set for someone wanting women to vote (10)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer would be <small>SUFFRAGIST</small>, which is "someone wanting women to vote". The word "odd" indicates that we must take every other letter of the rest of the clue, starting with the first: <b>S</b>t<b>u</b>f<b>f</b> o<b>f</b> M<b>r</b> W<b>a</b>u<b>g</b>h <b>i</b>s <b>s</b>e<b>t</b>.</p>
<p><a name="Deletions" id="Deletions"></a></p>

<p>Deletions consist of <i>beheadments</i>, <i>curtailments</i>, and <i>internal deletions</i>. In beheadments, a word loses its first letter. In curtailments, it loses its last letter, and internal deletions remove an inner letter, such as the middle one.</p>
<p>An example of a beheadment:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Beheaded celebrity is sailor (3)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer would be <small>TAR</small>, another word for "sailor", which is a "celebrity", or star, without the first letter.</p>
<p>Other indicator words of beheadment include "don't start", "topless", and "after the first".</p>
<p>An example of curtailment:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Shout, "Read!" endlessly (3)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer is <small>BOO</small>. If you ignore the punctuation, a book is a "read", and book "endlessly" is <i>boo</i>, a "shout".</p>
<p>Other indicators include "nearly" and "unfinished".</p>
<p>An example of internal deletion:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Challenging sweetheart heartlessly (6)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer is <small>DARING</small>, which means "challenging", and is darling without its middle letter, or "heartlessly".</p>
<p>Note that "sweetheart" could also be simply "wee" or the letter "E", that is, the "heart" (middle) of "sweet".</p>

<p>A clue may employ more than one method of wordplay. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Illustrious baron returns in pit (9)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer is <small>HONORABLE</small>. "Baron" "returns", or is reversed, and put inside "pit" or hole, to make <i>honorable</i>, or "illustrious".</p>

<p>A rare clue type is the "&amp; lit." clue, standing for "and literally so". In this case, the entire clue is both a definition and a cryptic clue. In some publications this is always indicated by an <a href="/wiki/Exclamation_mark" title="Exclamation mark">exclamation mark</a> at the end of the clue. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>God incarnate, essentially! (4)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer is <small>ODIN</small>. The Norse god <a href="/wiki/Odin" title="Odin">Odin</a> is hidden in "god incarnate", as clued by "essentially", but the definition of Odin is also the whole clue, as Odin is essentially a God incarnate.</p>
<p>This satisfies the "&amp; lit." clue definition but as read is clearly a cryptic clue. Another example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Spoil vote! (4)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>would give the answer <small>VETO</small>; in the cryptic sense, <i>spoil</i> works as an <a href="/wiki/Anagram" title="Anagram">anagram</a> indicator for <i>vote</i>, while the whole clue is, with a certain amount of licence allowed to crossword setters, a definition.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>e.g. Origin of goose (3)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>gives the answer <small>EGG</small>. Geese find their origins in eggs, so the whole clue gives "egg", but the clue can also be broken down: e.g. loses its full stops to give eg, followed by the first letter (i.e. the "origin") of the word goose--g--to make egg.</p>

<p>Visual clues are very rare. They are best explained using an example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Exclamation of surprise about spectacles (3)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The answer would be <small>COO</small>, which is an "exclamation of surprise". The 'c' comes from the abbreviation of the word "circa", meaning "about", and "spectacles" is <small>OO</small> because these letters look like a drawing of a pair of glasses.</p>

<p>Abbreviations are popular with crossword compilers for clueing individual letters or short sections of the answer.</p>
<p>Consider the following clue:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>About to come between little Desmond and worker for discourse (7)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>There are two abbreviations used here.

<p>The history of cryptic crosswords started in the UK. The first British crossword puzzles appeared around 1923 and were purely definitional, but from the mid-1920s they began to include cryptic material: not cryptic clues in the modern sense, but anagrams, classical allusions, incomplete quotations, and other references and wordplay. <b>Torquemada</b> (<a href="/wiki/Edward_Powys_Mathers" title="Edward Powys Mathers">Edward Powys Mathers</a>, 1892–1939), who set for <i>The Saturday Westminster</i> from 1925 and for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Observer" title="The Observer">The Observer</a></i> from 1926 until his death, was the first setter to use cryptic clues exclusively and is often credited as the inventor of the cryptic crossword.</p>
<p>The first newspaper crosswords appeared in the Sunday and Daily Express from about 1924. Crosswords were gradually taken up by other newspapers, appearing in the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" title="Daily Telegraph" class="mw-redirect">Daily Telegraph</a></i> from 1925, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Manchester_Guardian" title="The Manchester Guardian" class="mw-redirect">The Manchester Guardian</a></i> from 1929 and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> from 1930. These newspaper puzzles were almost entirely non-cryptic at first and gradually used more cryptic clues, until the fully cryptic puzzle as known today became widespread. In some papers this took until about 1960.</p>
<p>Puzzles appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Listener" title="The Listener">The Listener</a></i> from 1930, but this was a weekly magazine rather than a newspaper, and the puzzles were much harder than the newspaper ones, though again they took a while to become entirely cryptic.</p>
<p>Torquemada's puzzles were extremely obscure and difficult, and later setters reacted against this tendency by developing a standard for fair clues, ones that can be solved, at least in principle, by deduction, without needing leaps of faith or insights into the setter's thought processes.</p>
<p>The basic principle of fairness was set out by <i>Listener</i> setter <b>Afrit</b> (<a href="/w/index.php?title=Alistair_Ferguson_Ritchie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Alistair Ferguson Ritchie (page does not exist)">Alistair Ferguson Ritchie</a>) in his book <i>Armchair Crosswords</i> (1946), wherein he credits it to the fictional <i>Book of the Crossword</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>We must expect the composer to play tricks, but we shall insist that he play fair. The Book of the Crossword lays this injunction upon him: "You need not mean what you say, but you must say what you mean." This is a superior way of saying that he can't have it both ways. He may attempt to mislead by employing a form of words which can be taken in more than one way, and it is your fault if you take it the wrong way, but it is his fault if you can't logically take it the right way.</dd>
</dl>
<p>An example of a clue which cannot logically be taken the right way:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hat could be dry (5)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here the composer intends the answer to be "derby", with "hat" the definition, "could be" the anagram indicator, and "be dry" the anagram fodder. But "be" is doing double duty, and this means that any attempt to read the clue cryptically in the form "[definition] [anagram indicator] [fodder]" fails: if "be" is part of the anagram indicator, then the fodder is too short, but if it is part of the fodder, there is no anagram indicator.</p>
<p>Torquemada's successor at <i>The Observer</i> was <b>Ximenes</b> (<a href="/wiki/Derrick_Somerset_Macnutt" title="Derrick Somerset Macnutt">Derrick Somerset Macnutt</a>, 1902–1971), and in his influential work, <i>Ximenes on the Art of the Crossword Puzzle</i> (1966), he set out more detailed guidelines for setting fair cryptic clues, now known as "Ximenean principles".<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The most important of them are tersely summed up by Ximenes' successor <b><a href="/wiki/Azed" title="Azed">Azed</a></b> (<a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Crowther" title="Jonathan Crowther">Jonathan Crowther</a>, born 1942):</p>
<dl>
<dd>A good cryptic clue contains three elements:
<ol>
<li>a precise definition</li>
<li>a fair subsidiary indication</li>
<li>nothing else</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Ximenean principles are adhered to most strictly in the subgenre of "advanced cryptics" — difficult puzzles using barred grids and a large vocabulary. Easier puzzles often have more relaxed standards, permitting a wider array of clue types, and allowing a little flexibility. The popular <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">Guardian</a></i> setter <b>Araucaria</b> (<a href="/wiki/John_Galbraith_Graham" title="John Galbraith Graham">John Galbraith Graham</a>, born 1921) is a noted non-Ximenean, celebrated for his witty, if occasionally unorthodox, clues.</p>

<p>In Britain it is traditional -- dating from the cryptic crossword pioneer <a href="/wiki/Edward_Powys_Mathers" title="Edward Powys Mathers">Edward (Bill) Powys Mathers</a> (1892-1939), who called himself <a href="/wiki/Torquemada" title="Torquemada">Torquemada</a> in honour of the great <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition" title="Spanish Inquisition">Inquisitor</a> -- for compilers to use a single evocative pseudonym. Crispa, named from the Latin for "curly-headed", who set crosswords for the Guardian from 1954<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> until her retirement in 2004&lt;, legally changed her surname to Crisp after divorcing in the 1970s.</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Times</i></dt>
<dd><a href="/wiki/Adrian_Bell" title="Adrian Bell">Adrian Bell</a> was the first to set <a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The <i>Times</i></a> Crossword from 1930<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> and was one of those responsible for establishing its distinctive cryptic style. (The <i>Times</i> was a late adopter: the <i>Telegraph</i>, for example, started printing a crossword in 1925.) The Times has a team of about 15 setters, many of whom set puzzles for other papers. The setter of each puzzle is not identified. The Times also has "jumbo" (23x23) puzzles in the Saturday edition and since 1991 has provided a home for the famously difficult advanced cryptic puzzle which used to appear in the <a href="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Listener" title="The Listener">The Listener</a></i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The daily Times puzzle is syndicated in the New York Post (US) and The Australian (Aus) papers. In both cases, the puzzle appears some weeks after it appeared in The Times.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In October 2007, <a href="/wiki/The_Bugle" title="The Bugle">The Bugle</a>, a TimesOnline podcast by <a href="/wiki/John_Oliver" title="John Oliver">John Oliver</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andy_Zaltzman" title="Andy Zaltzman">Andy Zaltzman</a>, introduced the first, revolutionary "Audio Cryptic Crossword."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Daily Telegraph</i></dt>
<dd>The Telegraph, like the Times, doesn't identify the setter of each puzzle but, unlike the Times, has a regular setter for each day of the week, plus a few occasional setters to cover holidays or sickness. Regular setters are: Monday/Roger Squires; Tuesday/Ray Terrell; Wednesday/Ann Tait; Thursday/Jeremy Mutch; Friday/Don Manley; Saturday/Peter Chamberlain. Edited by Phil McNeill, who took over from Kate Fassett in early 2009. There's an advanced cryptic called Enigmatic Variations in the Sunday Telegraph, and a 15x15 blocked grid puzzle too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In September 2008 the Telegraph started printing a 'Toughie' crossword as well as the daily puzzle, on Tues-Fri. This is described by the paper as "the toughest crossword in Fleet Street" or similar. Comments from some solvers on the first few of these puzzles didn't agree with this assessment, rating most as close to average broadsheet cryptic difficulty</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Independent</i></dt>
<dd>The Independent is a relative newcomer but is generally regarded as a source of some of the most innovative crosswords. Setters include Virgilius, Dac, Phi, Quixote, Nimrod, Monk, Nestor, Bannsider, Merlin, Mass, Math, Morph, Scorpion, Tees and Punk. The crosswords are often themed and may contain a Nina - a hidden feature. The daily puzzle is edited by Eimi (Mike Hutchinson) and the fiendish Inquisitor puzzle is edited by former <i>Times</i> crossword editor Mike Laws.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Sunday Times</i></dt>
<dd>The main compiler for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times" title="The Sunday Times">The Sunday Times</a></i> is Barbara Hall (who also compiles the simpler dictionary crossword) and has been Puzzles Editor for thirty two years. The beneficial effect of crosswords' mental stimulation can be seen from Barbara's record: her first crossword was published in 1937 and she is still going strong after nearly seventy years of setting. The Sunday Times is also home to the fiendish Mephisto puzzle set for the last 10 years by Chris Feetenby (replaced by Paul McKenna in 2008), Mike Laws and Tim Moorey.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Guardian</i></dt>
<dd>Notable compilers of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>’s cryptic crosswords include <a href="/wiki/Araucaria_(compiler)" title="Araucaria (compiler)" class="mw-redirect">Araucaria</a>, Enigmatist, Pasquale, Paul, Rufus, and the late <a href="/wiki/Bob_Smithies" title="Bob Smithies">Bob Smithies</a> (Bunthorne). The puzzle is edited by Hugh Stephenson.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Observer</i></dt>
<dd>Home of the estimable <a href="/wiki/Azed" title="Azed">Azed</a> crossword, which employs a barred grid and a wider vocabulary than standard cryptics. On the first Sunday of every month and at Christmas, Azed runs a clue-writing competition, via which many of today's top compilers have learnt their trade. <i>The Observer</i> also features a standard cryptic crossword, the Everyman, compiled by Allan Scott.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Radio Times</i></dt>
<dd>Roger Prebble has compiled the cryptic crossword since 1999.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Spectator</i></dt>
<dd>Cryptics in the weekly <i><a href="/wiki/Spectator" title="Spectator">Spectator</a></i> often have a specific theme, such as a tribute to a public figure who has died recently or a historic event which has its anniversary this week. As in most British periodicals, the cryptic in the Spectator is numbered: in the Spectator's case, a puzzle's theme may be related to its specific number (such as a historic event which occurred in the year corresponding to the four-digit number of the puzzle for that week). Compilers include Doc (the puzzle editor as well as chief setter), Dumpynose (an anagram for 'Pseudonym') and Columba.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>Irish Times</i></dt>
<dd>The Irish Times includes a daily puzzle by <a href="/wiki/Crosaire" title="Crosaire">"Crosaire"</a> (Derek Crozier), with a fairly unorthodox style of clue-writing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Globe and Mail</i> (Canada)</dt>
<dd>"Canada's national newspaper" includes a daily cryptic somewhat less difficult than its British cousins. The crossword also comes with another set of "Quick Clues" (American-style) which provide a completely different set of answers. Fraser Simpson compiles the Saturday cryptic; he also compiles an advanced cryptic in <i>The Walrus</i>. Once a year near Christmas, <i>The Globe</i> publishes an enormous crossword on a double-page spread.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>The Listener</i> (New Zealand)</dt>
<dd>This weekly magazine includes a cryptic by David Tossman, who took over from RWH (Ruth Hendry) in 1997. RWH had been providing a mixed (some cryptic clues) puzzle since 1940.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>New York Magazine</i></dt>
<dd><a href="/wiki/Stephen_Sondheim" title="Stephen Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>’s puzzles for <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Magazine" title="New York Magazine" class="mw-redirect">New York Magazine</a></i> have been collected in book form. Sondheim is himself a collector of old-time puzzles and board games.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>New Yorker</i></dt>
<dd>For some of the time that this magazine was edited by Tina Brown (1997-1999), it included a small (8x10) barred-grid cryptic crossword, set by a range of American and Canadian setters. These puzzles are also available in a book collection.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>New York Times</i></dt>
<dd>Two weeks in every 18, the 'variety puzzle' in the Sunday edition is a cryptic crossword, usually by <a href="/wiki/Emily_Cox_(compiler)" title="Emily Cox (compiler)" class="mw-redirect">Emily Cox</a> and <a href="/wiki/Henry_Rathvon" title="Henry Rathvon">Henry Rathvon</a>, Richard Silvestri, or Fraser Simpson. One week in 18, it's a "Puns and Anagrams" puzzle, a relic of a 1940s attempt to introduce cryptic puzzles to the US.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><i>Private Eye</i></dt>
<dd>In the early 1970s the satirical magazine <i><a href="/wiki/Private_Eye" title="Private Eye">Private Eye</a></i> had a crossword set by the Labour MP <a href="/wiki/Tom_Driberg" title="Tom Driberg" class="mw-redirect">Tom Driberg</a>, under the pseudonym of "Tiresias" (supposedly "a distinguished academic churchman"). It is currently set by Eddie James under the name "Cyclops". This crossword is usually topical, and contains material varying from risqué to rude, in clues, answers and the solver's head - much of the rudeness is by innuendo.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> It also often includes references to the content of the rest of the magazine, or its jargon in which, for example the current monrarch of the UK is "Brenda" and the likely next one "Prince Brian". The £100 prize for the first correct solution opened is unusually high for a crossword and attracts many entrants.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></dd>

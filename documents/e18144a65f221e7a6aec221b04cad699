<p>Though his exact birth date is unknown, Wild was born in <a href="/wiki/Wolverhampton" title="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a> in either 1682 or 1683 as the first of five children in a poor family.<sup id="cite_ref-moore18_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore18-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> He was baptised at <a href="/wiki/St._Peter%27s_Collegiate_Church,_Wolverhampton" title="St. Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton">St. Peter's Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton</a>. His father, John Wild, was a <a href="/wiki/Carpenter" title="Carpenter" class="mw-redirect">carpenter</a>, and his mother sold herbs and fruits in the local market. At that time, Wolverhampton was the second-largest city in <a href="/wiki/Staffordshire" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, with a population of around 6,000, many involved in iron-working and related trades.</p>
<p>Wild attended the Free School in St John's Lane, and was <a href="/wiki/Apprenticeship" title="Apprenticeship">apprenticed</a> to a local <a href="/wiki/Buckle" title="Buckle">buckle</a>-maker.<sup id="cite_ref-moore19_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore19-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> He married and had a son, but came to London in 1704 as a <a href="/wiki/Domestic_worker" title="Domestic worker">servant</a>. After being dismissed by his master, he returned to Wolverhampton, before coming back to London in 1708.<sup id="cite_ref-moore20_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore20-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> London was by far the largest city in England, with a population of around 600,000, of whom around 70,000 lived within the ancient <a href="/wiki/City_wall" title="City wall" class="mw-redirect">city walls</a> of the <a href="/wiki/City_of_London" title="City of London">City of London</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-moore3_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore3-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Little is known of Wild's first two years in London, but he was arrested for <a href="/wiki/Debt" title="Debt">debt</a> in March 1710, and sent to <a href="/wiki/Wood_Street_Counter" title="Wood Street Counter">Wood Street Counter</a>, one of the <a href="/wiki/Debtor%27s_prison" title="Debtor's prison" class="mw-redirect">debtor's prisons</a> in the <a href="/wiki/City_of_London" title="City of London">City of London</a>. The prisons were notoriously corrupt, with gaolers demanding a bribe, or "garnish", for any minor comfort. Wild became popular, running errands for the gaolers and eventually earning enough to repay his original debts and the cost of being imprisoned, and even lend money to other prisoners. He received "the liberty of the gate", meaning that he was allowed out at night to aid in the arrest of thieves.<sup id="cite_ref-moore25_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore25-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> There, he met one <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mary_Milliner&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mary Milliner (page does not exist)">Mary Milliner</a> (or Mary Mollineaux), a <a href="/wiki/Prostitution" title="Prostitution">prostitute</a> who began to teach Wild criminal ways and, according to <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" title="Daniel Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, "brought him into her own gang, whether of thieves or whores, or of both, is not much material." He was also introduced to a wide range of London's criminal underclass. With his new skills and contacts, Wild was released in 1712 under an <a href="/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" title="Act of Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> passed earlier that year for the relief of insolvent debtors.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-moore43_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore43-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Upon release, Wild began to live with Mary Milliner as her husband in Lewkenor's Land (now Macklin Street) in <a href="/wiki/Covent_Garden" title="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-moore43_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore43-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> despite both of them having prior marriages. Wild apparently served as Milliner's tough when she went night-walking. Soon Wild was thoroughly acquainted with the <a href="/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">underworld</a>, both with its methods and its inhabitants. At some point during this period, Milliner had begun to act as something of a madam to other prostitutes, and Wild as a <a href="/wiki/Fence_(criminal)" title="Fence (criminal)">fence</a>, or receiver of stolen goods. Wild began, slowly at first, to dispose of stolen goods and to pay bribes to get thieves out of <a href="/wiki/Prison" title="Prison">jail</a>.</p>
<p>He later parted with Milliner, cutting off her ear to mark her as a whore.<sup id="cite_ref-moore65_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore65-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Crime had risen dramatically in London beginning in 1680, and property crime, in particular, rose sharply as London grew in importance as a commercial hub. In 1712 <a href="/wiki/Charles_Hitchen" title="Charles Hitchen">Charles Hitchen</a>, Wild's forerunner and future rival as <a href="/wiki/Thief-taker" title="Thief-taker">thief-taker</a>, said that he personally knew 2,000 people in London who made their living solely by theft. In 1711 Hitchen had obtained public office as the City's Under Marshal, effectively its top policeman, paying £700 for the appointment. He abused his office, however, by practising extortion on an extravagant scale, both from thieves and from their potential victims.<sup id="cite_ref-moore63_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore63-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Hitchen would accept bribes to let thieves out of jail, selectively arrest criminals, and coerce sexual services from <a href="/wiki/Molly_house" title="Molly house">molly houses</a>. His <a href="/wiki/Testimony#Legal_testimony" title="Testimony">testimony</a> about the rise of crime was given during an investigation of these activities by the London <a href="/wiki/Board_of_Aldermen" title="Board of Aldermen" class="mw-redirect">Board of Aldermen</a>, who suspended him from the Under Marshal position in 1713.</p>
<p>In around 1713, Wild was approached by Hitchen to become one of his assistants in thief-taking, a profitable activity on account of the £40 reward paid by the government for catching a felon. Wild may have become known to Hitchen's associates, known as his "Mathematicians", during his lengthy stay in <a href="/wiki/Wood_Street_Compter" title="Wood Street Compter" class="mw-redirect">Wood Street Compter</a>; certainly one, William Field, later worked for Wild.<sup id="cite_ref-moore63_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore63-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The advent of daily newspapers had led to a rising interest in crime and criminals. As the papers reported notable crimes and ingenious attacks, the public worried more and more about property crime and grew more and more interested in the issues of criminals and policing. London depended entirely upon localized policing and had no city-wide police force. Unease with crime was at a feverish high. The public was eager to embrace both colourful criminals (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sheppard" title="Jack Sheppard">Jack Sheppard</a> and the entirely upper-class gang called the "<a href="/wiki/Mohocks" title="Mohocks">Mohocks</a>" in 1712) and valiant crime-fighters. The city's population had more than doubled, and there was no effective means of controlling crime. London saw a rise not only in thievery, but in <a href="/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">organized crime</a> during the period.</p>
<p>The ending of the <a href="/wiki/War_of_the_Spanish_Succession" title="War of the Spanish Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> meant a further increase in crime as demobilized soldiers were on the streets. By this time, 1714, Hitchen was restored to his office, but Wild went his own way, and he opened a small office in the Blue Boar tavern, run by Mrs Seagoe in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Little_Old_Bailey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Little Old Bailey (page does not exist)">Little Old Bailey</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-moore65_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore65-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> He continued to call himself Hitchen's "Deputy", entirely without any official standing, and took to carrying a sword as a mark of his supposed authority, also alluding to pretensions of gentility.<sup id="cite_ref-moore65_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore65-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a name=".22Thief-Taker_General.22" id=".22Thief-Taker_General.22"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Jonathan_Wild&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: &quot;Thief-Taker General&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Thief-Taker General"</span></h2>
<p>Wild's method of illegally amassing riches while appearing to be on the side of the law was ingenious. He ran a gang of thieves, kept the stolen goods, and waited for the crime and theft to be announced in the <a href="/wiki/Newspaper" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a>. At this point, he would claim that his "thief taking agents" (police) had "found" the stolen merchandise, and he would return it to its rightful owners for a reward (to cover the expenses of running his agents). In some cases, if the stolen items or circumstances allowed for <a href="/wiki/Blackmail" title="Blackmail">blackmail</a>, he did not wait for the theft to be announced. As well as "recovering" these stolen goods, he would offer the police aid in finding the thieves. The thieves that Wild would help to "discover", however, were rivals or members of his own gang who had refused to cooperate with his taking the majority of the money.</p>
<p>Wild's ability to hold his gang together, and indeed the majority of his scheme, relied upon the fear of theft and the nation's reaction to theft. The crime of selling stolen goods became increasingly dangerous in the period from 1700 to 1720. Low-level thieves ran a great risk in fencing their goods. Wild avoided this danger and exploited it simultaneously by having his gang steal, either through <a href="/wiki/Pickpocketing" title="Pickpocketing">pick-pocketing</a> or, more often, <a href="/wiki/Robbery" title="Robbery">mugging</a>, and then by "recovering" the goods. He never sold the goods back, explicitly, nor ever pretended that they were not stolen. He claimed at all times that he found the goods by policing and avowed hatred of thieves. That very penalty for selling stolen goods, however, allowed Wild to control his gang very effectively, for he could turn in any of his thieves to the authorities at any time. By giving the goods to him for a cut of the profits, Wild's thieves were selling stolen goods. If they did not give their take to him, Wild would simply apprehend them as thieves. However, what Wild chiefly did was use his thieves and ruffians to "apprehend" rival gangs.</p>
<p>Jonathan Wild was not the first thief-taker who was actually a thief himself. <a href="/wiki/Charles_Hitchen" title="Charles Hitchen">Charles Hitchen</a> had used his position as Under-Marshal to practice <a href="/wiki/Extortion" title="Extortion">extortion</a>. He had pressured brothels and pickpockets to pay him off or give him the stolen goods since purchasing the position in 1712, and the extortion was already an established practice at that time. When Hitchen was suspended from his duties for corruption in that year, he engaged Jonathan Wild to keep his business of extortion going in his absence. Hitchen was re-instated in 1714 and found that Wild was now a rival, and one of Wild's first bits of gang warfare was to eliminate as many of the thieves in Hitchen's control as he could. In 1718, Hitchen attempted to expose Wild with his <i>A True Discovery of the Conduct of Receivers and Thief-Takers in and about the City of London.</i> There he named Wild as a manager and source of crime. Wild replied with <i>An Answer to a Late Insolent Libel</i> and there explained that Hitchen was a <a href="/wiki/Homosexual" title="Homosexual" class="mw-redirect">homosexual</a> who visited "<a href="/wiki/Molly_house" title="Molly house">molly houses</a>." Hitchen attempted to further combat Wild with a pamphlet entitled <i>The Regulator,</i> which was his characterization of Wild, but Hitchen's prior suspensions from duties and the shocking charge of homosexuality virtually eliminated him as a threat to Wild.</p>
<p>Wild held a virtual monopoly on crime in London. Legends arose surrounding his management of his "empire." One held that he kept records of all thieves in his employ, and when they had outlived their usefulness, Wild sold them to the gallows for the £40 reward. This supposed system inspired a <a href="/wiki/Fake_etymology" title="Fake etymology" class="mw-redirect">fake</a> or <a href="/wiki/Folk_etymology" title="Folk etymology" class="mw-redirect">folk etymology</a> of the phrase "<a href="/wiki/Double_cross" title="Double cross">double cross</a>." It is alleged that, when a thief vexed Wild in some way, he put a cross by the thief's name; a second cross condemned the man to be sold to the Crown for <a href="/wiki/Hanging" title="Hanging">hanging</a>. (This fabulous story is contradicted by the fact that the noun "double cross" did not enter English usage until 1834.)</p>
<p>In public, Wild presented an heroic face. He was the man who returned stolen goods. He was the man who caught criminals. In 1718, Wild called himself "Thief Taker General of Great Britain and Ireland". By his testimony, over sixty thieves were sent to the gallows. His "finding" of lost merchandise was private, but his efforts at finding thieves were public. Wild's office in the <a href="/wiki/Old_Bailey" title="Old Bailey">Old Bailey</a> was a busy spot. Victims of crime would come by, even before announcing their losses, and discover that Wild's agents had "found" the missing items, and Wild would offer to help find the criminals for an extra fee. However, while fictional treatments made use of the device, it is not known whether or not Wild ever actually turned in one of his own gang for a private fee.</p>
<p>In 1720, Wild's fame was such that the <a href="/wiki/Privy_Council" title="Privy Council" class="mw-redirect">Privy Council</a> consulted with him on methods of controlling crime. Wild's recommendation was, unsurprisingly, that the rewards for evidence against thieves be raised. Indeed, the reward for capturing a thief went from forty <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" title="Pound sterling">pounds</a> to one hundred and forty pounds within the year. This amounted to a significant pay increase for Wild. There is some evidence that Wild was favoured, or at least ignored, by the <a href="/wiki/British_Whig_Party" title="British Whig Party" class="mw-redirect">Whig</a> politicians and opposed by the <a href="/wiki/Tory" title="Tory">Tory</a> politicians. In 1718, a Tory group had succeeded in having the laws against receiving stolen property tightened, primarily with Wild's activities in mind. Ironically, this strengthened Wild's hand, rather than weakening it, for it made it more difficult for thieves to fence their goods <i>except</i> through Wild.</p>
<p>Wild's battles with thieves made excellent press. Wild himself would approach the papers with accounts of his derring-do, and the papers passed these on to a concerned public. Thus, in July to August of 1724, the papers carried accounts of Wild's heroic efforts in collecting twenty-one members of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Carrick_Gang&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Carrick Gang (page does not exist)">Carrick Gang</a> (with an £800 reward - approximately £25,000 in the year 2000). When one of the members of the gang was released, Wild pursued him and had him arrested on "further information". To the public, this seemed like a relentless defense of order. In reality, it was a gang warfare disguised as national service.</p>
<p>When Wild solicited for a finder's fee, he usually held all the power in the transaction. For example, David Nokes quotes (based on Howson) the following advertisement from the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Post" title="Daily Post">Daily Post</a></i> in 1724 in his edition of <a href="/wiki/Henry_Fielding" title="Henry Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>'s <i>Jonathan Wild</i>:</p>

<p>The advert is extortion. The "notes of hand" (agreements of debt) mean signatures, so Wild already knows the name of the book's owner. Furthermore, Wild tells the owner through the ad that he knows what its owner was doing at the time, since the Fountain Tavern was a <a href="/wiki/Brothel" title="Brothel">brothel</a>. The real purpose of the ad is to threaten the notebook's owner with announcing his visit to a bordello, either to the debtors or the public, and it even names a price for silence (a <a href="/wiki/British_coin_Guinea" title="British coin Guinea" class="mw-redirect">guinea</a>, or one pound and one shilling).</p>

<p>By 1724, London political life was experiencing a crisis of public confidence. In 1720, the <a href="/wiki/South_Sea_Bubble" title="South Sea Bubble" class="mw-redirect">South Sea Bubble</a> had burst, and the public was growing restive about corruption.

<p>In late April 1724, the most famous housebreaker of the era, <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sheppard" title="Jack Sheppard">Jack Sheppard</a>, was apprehended by one of Wild's men, James "Hell-and-Fury" Sykes, for a burglary Sheppard had committed in Clare Market on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="02-05"><a href="/wiki/February_5" title="February 5">5 February</a></span>.<sup id="cite_ref-moore100_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore100-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Sheppard had worked with Wild in the past, though he had struck out on his own. Consequently, as with other arrests, Wild's interests in saving the public from Sheppard were personal.</p>
<p>Sheppard was imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/St_Giles%27s_Roundhouse" title="St Giles's Roundhouse">St Giles's Roundhouse</a>, but escaped within three hours.<sup id="cite_ref-moore104_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore104-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="05-19"><a href="/wiki/May_19" title="May 19">19 May</a></span>, Wild again had Sheppard arrested for <a href="/wiki/Pickpocketing" title="Pickpocketing">pickpocketing</a>, and this time he was put in St. Ann's Roundhouse in <a href="/wiki/Soho" title="Soho">Soho</a>, where he was visited by Elizabeth "Edgworth Bess" Lyon the next day; she too was locked up with him, and, being recognized as man and wife, they were sent to the <a href="/wiki/New_Prison" title="New Prison">New Prison</a> at <a href="/wiki/Clerkenwell" title="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>.

However, Wild, along with Field and William Kneebone, Sheppard's former master, presented evidence against him on the final charge of the burglary of Kneebone's house on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="07-12"><a href="/wiki/July_12" title="July 12">12 July</a></span>; and Sheppard was convicted, sentenced to death, and put in the condemned hold of <a href="/wiki/Newgate_Prison" title="Newgate Prison">Newgate Prison</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On the night that the death warrant arrived, <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="08-31"><a href="/wiki/August_31" title="August 31">31 August</a></span>, Sheppard escaped. By this point, Sheppard was a <a href="/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> hero for apprentices (being a <a href="/wiki/Cockney" title="Cockney">cockney</a> <a href="/wiki/Apprenticeship" title="Apprenticeship">apprentice</a> in love, non-violent, and handsome). On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="09-09"><a href="/wiki/September_9" title="September 9">9 September</a></span>, Sheppard avoided capture by Wild's men, but he was caught for a fourth time by a posse from Newgate as he hid out on <a href="/wiki/Finchley_Common" title="Finchley Common">Finchley Common</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-moore209_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore209-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> and Sheppard was placed in the most secure room of Newgate. Further, Sheppard was put in shackles <i>and</i> chained to the floor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="10-09"><a href="/wiki/October_9" title="October 9">9 October</a></span>, Wild and his men arrested <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Blake_(criminal)" title="Joseph Blake (criminal)">Joseph "Blueskin" Blake</a>, a highwayman and Sheppard's partner-in-crime.<sup id="cite_ref-moore158_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore158-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="10-15"><a href="/wiki/October_15" title="October 15">15 October</a></span> Blueskin was tried for the same act of burglary committed on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="07-12"><a href="/wiki/July_12" title="July 12">12 July</a></span>, with Wild, Field, and his men giving evidence.

Enraged, Blueskin attempted to murder Wild, slashing his throat in the process and causing an uproar, and Wild collapsed and was taken to a surgeon for treatment.<sup id="cite_ref-moore159_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore159-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Taking advantage of the disturbance that spread to Newgate next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped yet again in early <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="10-16"><a href="/wiki/October_16" title="October 16">16 October</a></span>.<sup id="cite_ref-moore161_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore161-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Sheppard had broken the chains, padlocks, and six iron-barred doors. This escape astonished everyone, and <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" title="Daniel Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, working as a <a href="/wiki/Journalism" title="Journalism">journalist</a>, wrote an account. In the early morning on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="11-01"><a href="/wiki/November_1" title="November 1">1 November</a></span>, Sheppard was found for a fifth and final time by a constable and arrested.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> This time, Sheppard was placed in the centre of Newgate, where he could be observed at all times, and loaded with three hundred pounds of iron weights. He was so celebrated that the gaolers charged high society visitors to see him, and <a href="/wiki/James_Thornhill" title="James Thornhill">James Thornhill</a> painted his portrait.</p>
<p>On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="11-11"><a href="/wiki/November_11" title="November 11">11 November</a></span>, Blueskin was hanged.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Five days later Sheppard was similarly executed at <a href="/wiki/Tyburn,_London" title="Tyburn, London">Tyburn</a>.

<p>During the pursuit of Sheppard, Wild appeared as much to disadvantage in the press as Sheppard did to advantage. Wild was now despised. When, after his recovery, Wild used violence to perform a jail break for one of his gang members, he was being sought out and went into hiding for several weeks, and returned to business when he thought the affair had blown over. On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="02-06"><a href="/wiki/February_6" title="February 6">6 February</a></span> 1725, he was summoned to Leicester house, where he failed to recover a gold watch for one of his attendants because of the jail break and the incident with Blueskin at the Old Bailey. <sup id="cite_ref-moore238_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore238-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

In the illustration from the <i>True Effigy</i> (top of page), Wild is pictured in Newgate, still with notebook in hand to account for goods coming in and going out of his office. Evidence was presented against Wild for the violent jailbreak and for having stolen jewels during the previous August's installation of <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Garter" title="Order of the Garter">Knights of the Garter</a>.</p>
<p>The public's mood had shifted; they supported the average man and resented authority figures. Wild's trial occurred at the same time as that of the <a href="/wiki/Lord_Chancellor" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, Lord <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Parker,_1st_Earl_of_Macclesfield" title="Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield">Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield</a>, for taking £100,000 in bribes. With the changing tide, it appeared at last to Wild's gang that their leader would not escape, and they began to come forward. Slowly, gang members began to turn evidence on him, until all of his activities, including his grand scheme of running and then hanging thieves, became known. Additionally, evidence was offered as to Wild's frequent bribery of public officers.</p>
<p>Wild's final trial occurred at the Old Bailey on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="05-15"><a href="/wiki/May_15" title="May 15">15 May</a></span>.<sup id="cite_ref-moore246_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore246-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> He was tried on two indictments of privately stealing 50&#160;yards (46&#160;m) of lace from Catherine Steatham (a lace-seller who had visited him in prison on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="03-10"><a href="/wiki/March_10" title="March 10">10 March</a></span>) at Holborn on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="01-22"><a href="/wiki/January_22" title="January 22">22 January</a></span>.

</blockquote>
<p>Wild's hanging was a great event, and tickets were sold in advance for the best vantage points (see the reproduction of the gallows ticket). Even in a year with a great many macabre spectacles, Wild drew an especially large and boisterous crowd. Eighteen-year-old <a href="/wiki/Henry_Fielding" title="Henry Fielding">Henry Fielding</a> was in attendance. Wild was accompanied by William Sperry and the two Roberts Sanford and Harpham, three of the four prisoners who had been condemned to die with Wild a few days before.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Because he was heavily drugged, he was the last to die after the three of them, without any difficulty that had happened at Sheppard's execution.<sup id="cite_ref-moore256_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-moore256-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Jonathan Wild is famous today not so much for setting the example for organized crime as for the uses <a href="/wiki/Satire" title="Satire">satirists</a> made of his story.</p>
<p>When Wild was hanged, the papers were filled with accounts of his life, collections of his sayings, farewell speeches, and the like. <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Defoe" title="Daniel Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> wrote one narrative for <i>Applebee's Journal</i> in May and then had published <i>True and Genuine Account of the Life and Actions of the Late Jonathan Wild</i> in June 1725. This work competed with another that claimed to have excerpts from Wild's diaries. The illustration above is from the frontispiece to the "True Effigy of Mr. Jonathan Wild," a companion piece to one of the pamphlets purporting to offer the thief-taker's biography.</p>
<p>Criminal biography was already an existing genre. These works were popular then, as now, because they could offer a touching account of need, a fall from innocence, sex, violence, and then repentance or a tearful end. Public fascination with the dark side of human nature, and with the causes of evil, has never waned, and the market for mass produced accounts was large.</p>
<p>By 1701 there had been a <i>Lives of the Gamesters</i> (often appended to <a href="/wiki/Charles_Cotton" title="Charles Cotton">Charles Cotton</a>'s <i>The Compleat Gamester</i>), about notorious gamblers. In 1714 Captain Alexander Smith had written the best-selling <i>Complete Lives of the Most Notorious Highwaymen</i>. Defoe himself was no stranger to this market: his <i><a href="/wiki/Moll_Flanders" title="Moll Flanders">Moll Flanders</a></i> was published in 1722. Further, he had, by 1725, written both a <i>History</i> and a <i>Narrative</i> of the life of <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sheppard" title="Jack Sheppard">Jack Sheppard</a> (see above). <i>Moll Flanders</i> may be based on the life of one <a href="/wiki/Moll_King" title="Moll King" class="mw-redirect">Moll King</a>, who lived with Mary Mollineaux/Milliner, Wild's first mistress.</p>
<p>What differs about the case of Jonathan Wild is that it was not simply a crime story. Parallels between Wild and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Walpole" title="Robert Walpole">Robert Walpole</a> were instantly drawn, especially by the <a href="/wiki/Tory" title="Tory">Tory</a> authors of the day. <i>Mist's Weekly Journal</i> (one of the more rough-speaking Tory journals) drew a parallel between the figures in May 1725, when the hanging was still in the news.</p>
<p>The parallel is most important for <a href="/wiki/John_Gay" title="John Gay">John Gay</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Beggar%27s_Opera" title="The Beggar's Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a></i> in 1728. The main story of the <i>Beggar's Opera</i> focuses on the episodes between Wild and Sheppard. In the <a href="/wiki/Opera" title="Opera">opera</a>, the character of Peachum stands in for Wild (who stands in for Walpole), while the figure of Macheath stands in for Sheppard (who stands in for Wild and/or the chief officers of the <a href="/wiki/The_South_Sea_Company" title="The South Sea Company" class="mw-redirect">South Sea Company</a>). Robert Walpole himself saw and enjoyed <i>Beggar's Opera</i> without realizing that he was its intended target. Once he did realize it, he banned the sequel opera, <i>Polly</i>, without staging. This prompted Gay to write to a friend, "For writing in the cause of virtue and against the fashionable vices, I have become the most hated man in England almost."</p>
<p>In 1742, Robert Walpole lost his position of power in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" title="British House of Commons" class="mw-redirect">House of Commons</a>. He was created a <a href="/wiki/Peerage" title="Peerage">peer</a> and moved to the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, from where he still directed the <a href="/wiki/British_Whig_Party" title="British Whig Party" class="mw-redirect">Whig</a> majority in Commons for years. In 1743, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Fielding" title="Henry Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Life_and_Death_of_Jonathan_Wild,_the_Great" title="The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great">The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great</a></i> appeared in the third volume of <i>Miscellanies</i>.</p>
<p>Fielding is merciless in his attack on Walpole. In his work, Wild stands in for Walpole directly, and, in particular, he invokes the Walpolean language of the "Great Man". Walpole had come to be described by both the Whig and then, satirically, by the Tory political writers as the "Great Man", and Fielding has his Wild constantly striving, with stupid violence, to be "Great". "Greatness," according to Fielding, is only attained by mounting to the top stair (of the gallows). Fielding's satire also consistently attacks the Whig party by having Wild choose, among all the thieves <a href="/wiki/Cant_(language)" title="Cant (language)">cant</a> terms (several <a href="/wiki/Lexicon" title="Lexicon">lexicons</a> of which were printed with the <i>Lives</i> of Wild in 1725), "<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prig" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:prig">prig</a>" to refer to the profession of burglary. Fielding suggests that Wild becoming a Great Prig was the same as Walpole becoming a Great Whig: theft and the Whig party were never so directly linked.</p>
<p>The figures of Peachum and Macheath were picked up by <a href="/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht" title="Bertolt Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> for his updating of Gay's opera as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Threepenny_Opera" title="The Threepenny Opera">The Threepenny Opera</a></i>. The Sheppard character, Macheath, is the "hero" of the song <i><a href="/wiki/Mack_the_Knife" title="Mack the Knife">Mack the Knife</a></i>.</p>

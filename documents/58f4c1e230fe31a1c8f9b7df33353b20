<p>Enoch Powell was born in <a href="/wiki/Stechford" title="Stechford">Stechford</a>, <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, England. He lived there for the first six years of his life before moving, in 1918, to <a href="/wiki/Kings_Norton" title="Kings Norton">Kings Norton</a>, where he lived until 1930. He was the only child of Albert Enoch Powell (1872–1956), primary school headmaster, and his wife, Ellen Mary (1886–1953). Ellen was the daughter of Henry Breese, a <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> policeman, and his wife Eliza), who had given up her own teaching career after marrying. The Powells were of <a href="/wiki/Welsh_people" title="Welsh people">Welsh</a> descent, having moved to the developing <a href="/wiki/Black_Country" title="Black Country">Black Country</a> in the early 19th century. His great-grandfather was a <a href="/wiki/Coal_mining" title="Coal mining">miner</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Coalfield" title="Coalfield">coalfields</a>, and his grandfather had been employed in the iron trade.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Powell was a pupil at <a href="/wiki/King_Edward%27s_School,_Birmingham" title="King Edward's School, Birmingham">King Edward's School, Birmingham</a>, where he studied classics, specifically Latin and Greek (which would later influence his <a href="/wiki/Rivers_of_Blood_speech" title="Rivers of Blood speech">'Rivers of Blood' speech</a>), and was one of the few pupils in the school's history to attain 100% in an end-of-year English examination. He studied at <a href="/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, from 1930 to 1933. During his time at Cambridge he fell under the influence both of the poet <a href="/wiki/A._E._Housman" title="A. E. Housman" class="mw-redirect">A. E. Housman</a>, then Professor of Latin at the university, and of the writings of the German philosopher <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>. He took no part in politics at university.</p>
<p>It was while at Cambridge that Powell is recorded as having enjoyed one of his first close relationships.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Indeed, according to John Evans, Chaplain of <a href="/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity</a> and Extra Preacher to the Queen,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> instructions were left with him to reveal after Powell's death that at least one of the romantic affairs of his life had been <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" title="Homosexuality">homosexual</a>. Powell had particularly drawn the Chaplain's attention to lines in his First Poems (published 1937). Biographers such as <a href="/wiki/Simon_Heffer" title="Simon Heffer">Simon Heffer</a> dispute this however, and have argued that this did not mean that he was homosexual; merely that he had not yet met any girls.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After achieving a <a href="/wiki/British_undergraduate_degree_classification#First-Class_Honours" title="British undergraduate degree classification">double starred first</a> in Latin and Greek, he stayed on at Trinity College as a Fellow, spending much of his time studying ancient manuscripts in Rome and producing academic works in Greek and Welsh.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1937 he was appointed Professor of Greek at <a href="/wiki/Sydney_University" title="Sydney University" class="mw-redirect">Sydney University</a> aged 25 (failing in his aim of beating Nietzsche's record of becoming a professor at 24). Amongst his pupils was the future Prime Minister of Australia <a href="/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>. He revised Stuart-Jones's edition of <a href="/wiki/Thucydides" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War" title="History of the Peloponnesian War">Historiae</a></i> for the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University_Press" title="Oxford University Press">Oxford University Press</a> in 1938. His most lasting contribution to classical scholarship was his <i>Lexicon to Herodotus</i> (1938).</p>
<p>As well as his education at Cambridge, Powell took a course in <a href="/wiki/Urdu" title="Urdu">Urdu</a> at the School of Oriental Studies, now the <a href="/wiki/School_of_Oriental_and_African_Studies" title="School of Oriental and African Studies">School of Oriental and African Studies</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_London" title="University of London">University of London</a>, because he felt that his long-cherished ambition of becoming <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_India" title="Governor-General of India">Viceroy of India</a> would be unattainable without knowledge of an Indian language.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Soon after arrival in Sydney, Australia he was appointed Curator of the <a href="/wiki/Nicholson_Museum" title="Nicholson Museum">Nicholson Museum</a> at Sydney University. He stunned the vice-chancellor by informing him that war would soon break out in Europe, and that when it did he would be heading home to enlist in the army.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> By the time Powell left King Edward's School in 1930 he had confirmed his instinctive belief that the Armistice was merely temporary and that Britain would be at war with Germany again.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> During his time there as a professor, he grew increasingly angry at the <a href="/wiki/Appeasement" title="Appeasement">appeasement</a> of <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and what he saw as a betrayal of British national interests. After <a href="/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain" title="Neville Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>'s first visit to <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> at <a href="/wiki/Berchtesgaden" title="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a> Powell was bitter in a letter to his parents of 18 September 1938:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I do here in the most solemn and bitter manner curse the Prime Minister of England for having cumulated all his other betrayals of the national interest and honour, by his last terrible exhibition of dishonour, weakness and gullibility. The depths of infamy to which our accurst "love of peace" can lower us are unfathomable".<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another letter to his parents in June 1939, before the outbreak of war, Powell wrote:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In October 1939 Powell enlisted in the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Warwickshire_Regiment" title="Royal Warwickshire Regiment" class="mw-redirect">Royal Warwickshire Regiment</a>, almost a month after returning home. Powell enlisted in the ranks as an Australian. In later years he recorded his promotion from private to lance-corporal in his <i><a href="/wiki/Who%27s_Who_(UK)" title="Who's Who (UK)">Who's Who</a></i> entry, on other occasions describing it as a greater promotion than entering the Cabinet. He was trained for a commission after, whilst working in a kitchen, answering the question of an inspecting officer with a Greek proverb. He was commissioned on the <a href="/wiki/General_List" title="General List" class="mw-redirect">General List</a> in 1940, but almost immediately transferred to the <a href="/wiki/Intelligence_Corps" title="Intelligence Corps">Intelligence Corps</a>. In October 1941, as a Lieutenant, Powell was posted to <a href="/wiki/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> and transferred back to the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. He was soon promoted to the rank of <a href="/wiki/Major" title="Major">Major</a>. He helped mastermind the attack on <a href="/wiki/Erwin_Rommel" title="Erwin Rommel">Rommel</a>'s supply lines, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_El_Alamein" title="Battle of El Alamein">Battle of El Alamein</a>. Powell was promoted <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant-Colonel" title="Lieutenant-Colonel" class="mw-redirect">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> in August 1942. Twelve months later, in August 1943 he was posted to <a href="/wiki/Delhi" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>. Though he served in Africa with the <a href="/wiki/Desert_Rats" title="Desert Rats" class="mw-redirect">Desert Rats</a>, Powell himself never actually saw combat, serving for most of his military career as a staff officer. It was in <a href="/wiki/Algiers" title="Algiers">Algiers</a> that the seed of Powell's dislike of the United States was planted. After talking with some senior American officials, he became convinced that one of America's main war aims was to destroy the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. Writing home on 16 February 1943, Powell said: "I see growing on the horizon the greater peril than Germany or Japan ever were... our terrible enemy, America...."<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Powell's conviction of the anti-British attitude of the Americans continued during the war. Powell cut out and retained all his life an article from the <i><a href="/wiki/New_Statesman" title="New Statesman">New Statesman</a></i> newspaper of 13 November 1943, in which the American <a href="/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce" title="Clare Boothe Luce">Clare Boothe Luce</a> said in a speech that Indian independence would mean that the "USA will really have won the greatest war in the world for democracy".<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>He desperately wanted to go to the Far East to help the fight against Japan because "the war in Europe is won now, and I want to see the <a href="/wiki/Union_Flag" title="Union Flag">Union Flag</a> back in <a href="/wiki/Singapore" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>" before, Powell thought, the Americans beat Britain to it.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Powell began the war as the youngest professor in the Commonwealth; he ended it as the youngest <a href="/wiki/Brigadier" title="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> in the British army, one of the very few men in the entire war to rise from Private to Brigadier (another being <a href="/wiki/Fitzroy_Maclean" title="Fitzroy Maclean">Fitzroy Maclean</a>). Powell felt guilty for having survived when many of those he had met during his journey through the ranks had not. When once asked how he would like to be remembered, he at first answered "Others will remember me as they will remember me", but when pressed he replied "I should like to have been killed in the war."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Powell's ambition to be <a href="/wiki/Governor-General_of_India" title="Governor-General of India">Governor-General of India</a> crumbled in February 1947, when Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/Clement_Attlee" title="Clement Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> announced that <a href="/wiki/Indian_independence_movement" title="Indian independence movement">Indian independence</a> was imminent. Powell was so shocked by the change of policy that he spent the whole night after it was announced walking the streets of London, trying to take it in.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> He came to terms with it by becoming fiercely anti-imperialist, believing that once India had gone the whole empire should follow it. This logical absolutism explained his later indifference to the <a href="/wiki/Suez_crisis" title="Suez crisis" class="mw-redirect">Suez crisis</a>, his contempt for the Commonwealth, and his urging that Britain should scrap any remaining pretence that she was a world power.</p>
<p>On 2 January 1952 the 39-year-old Powell married 26-year-old Margaret Pamela Wilson, a former colleague from Conservative Central Office, who provided him with the settled and happy family life that was essential to his political career. They had two daughters, born in January 1954 and October 1956.</p>
<p>On 3 March 1953 Powell spoke against the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Titles_Act_1953" title="Royal Titles Act 1953" class="mw-redirect">Royal Titles Bill</a> in the House of Commons. He said he found three major changes to the style of the United Kingdom, "all of which seem to me to be evil". The first one was "that in this title, for the first time, will be recognised a principle hitherto never admitted in this country, namely, the divisibility of the crown". Powell said that the unity of the realm had evolved over centuries and included the British Empire: "It was a unit because it had one Sovereign. There was one Sovereign: one realm". He feared that by "recognising the division of the realm into separate realms, are we not opening the way for that other remaining unity – the last unity of all – that of the person, to go the way of the rest?"<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The second change he objected to was "the suppression of the word 'British', both from before the words 'Realms and Territories' where it is replaced by the words 'her other' and from before the word 'Commonwealth', which, in the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster" title="Statute of Westminster" class="mw-redirect">Statute of Westminster</a>, is described as the 'British Commonwealth of Nations'":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To say that he is Monarch of a certain territory and his other realms and territories is as good as to say that he is king of his kingdom. We have perpetrated a solecism in the title we are proposing to attach to our Sovereign and we have done so out of what might almost be called an abject desire to eliminate the expression 'British'. The same desire has been felt... to eliminate this word before the term 'Commonwealth'.... Why is it, then, that we are so anxious, in the description of our own Monarch, in a title for use in this country, to eliminate any reference to the seat, the focus and the origin of this vast aggregate of territories? Why is it that this 'teeming womb of royal Kings', as Shakespeare called it, wishes now to be anonymous?"<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Powell went on to claim the answer was that because the <a href="/wiki/British_Nationality_Act_1948" title="British Nationality Act 1948">British Nationality Act 1948</a> had removed allegiance to the crown as the basis of citizenship and replaced that with nine separate citizenships combined together by statute. Therefore if any of these nine countries became republics nothing in law would change, as happened with India when it became a republic. Furthermore, Powell went on, the essence of unity was "that all the parts recognise they would sacrifice themselves to the interests of the whole". He denied that there was in India that "recognition of belonging to a greater whole which involves the ultimate consequence in certain circumstances of self-sacrifice in the interests of the whole". Therefore the title 'Head of the Commonwealth', the third major change, was "essentially a sham. They are essentially something which we have invented to blind ourselves to the reality of the position".<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>These changes were "greatly repugnant" to Powell but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"... if they are changes which were demanded by those who in many wars had fought with this country, by nations who maintained an allegiance to the Crown, and who signified a desire to be in the future as were in the past; if it were our friends who had come to us and said: 'We want this,' I would say: 'Let it go. Let us admit the divisibility of the Crown. Let us sink into anonymity and cancel the word 'British' from our titles. If they like the conundrum 'Head of the Commonwealth' in the Royal style, let it be there'. However, the underlying evil of this is that we are doing it for the sake not of our friends but of those who are not our friends. We are doing this for the sake of those to whom the very names 'Britain' and 'British' are repugnant.... We are doing this for the sake of those who have deliberately cast off their allegiance to our common Monarchy."<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the rest of his life Powell regarded this speech as the finest he ever delivered.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Powell was a member of the Suez Group of MPs who were against the removal of British troops from the <a href="/wiki/Suez_Canal" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> because such a move would demonstrate, Powell argued, that Britain could no longer maintain a position there and that any claim to the Suez Canal would therefore be illogical. However, after the troops had left in 1954 and the Egyptians <a href="/wiki/Nationalisation" title="Nationalisation" class="mw-redirect">nationalised</a> the Canal in 1956, Powell opposed the British attempts to retake the Canal in the <a href="/wiki/Suez_War" title="Suez War" class="mw-redirect">Suez War</a> because he thought the British no longer had the resources to be a world power.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In December 1955 he was made a junior Housing Minister and later became <a href="/wiki/Financial_Secretary_to_the_Treasury" title="Financial Secretary to the Treasury">Financial Secretary to the Treasury</a>, but in January 1958 he resigned, along with the Chancellor of the Exchequer <a href="/wiki/Peter_Thorneycroft" title="Peter Thorneycroft" class="mw-redirect">Peter Thorneycroft</a> and his Treasury colleague <a href="/wiki/Nigel_Birch,_Baron_Rhyl" title="Nigel Birch, Baron Rhyl">Nigel Birch</a>, in protest at government plans for increased expenditure; he was a staunch deflationist, or in modern terms a <a href="/wiki/Monetarist" title="Monetarist" class="mw-redirect">monetarist</a>, and a believer in market forces.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> (Powell was also a member of the <a href="/wiki/Mont_Pelerin_Society" title="Mont Pelerin Society">Mont Pelerin Society</a>.) The by-product of this expenditure was the printing of extra money to pay for it all, which Powell believed to be a major cause of inflation, and in effect a form of taxation, as the holders of money find their money is worth less. Inflation rose to 2.5% - a high figure for the era, especially in peacetime.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s Powell backed <a href="/wiki/Deflation" title="Deflation">deflation</a> and in the 1960s was an advocate of <a href="/wiki/Free_market" title="Free market">free market</a> policies which at the time were seen as extreme and unworkable, as well as unpopular.

<p>On 27 July 1959 Powell gave his speech on <a href="/wiki/Hola_massacre" title="Hola massacre">Hola Camp</a> of Kenya, where eleven <a href="/wiki/Mau_Mau" title="Mau Mau" class="mw-redirect">Mau Mau</a> were killed after refusing work in the camp. Powell noted that some MPs had described the eleven as "sub-human" but Powell responded by saying: "In general, I would say that it is a fearful doctrine, which must recoil upon the heads of those who pronounce it, to stand in judgment on a fellow human being and to say, 'Because he was such-and-such, therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow'."<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Powell also disagreed with the notion that because it was in Africa then different methods were acceptable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nor can we ourselves pick and choose where and in what parts of the world we shall use this or that kind of standard. We cannot say, 'We will have African standards in Africa, Asian standards in Asia and perhaps British standards here at home'. We have not that choice to make. We must be consistent with ourselves everywhere. All Government, all influence of man upon man, rests upon opinion. What we can do in Africa, where we still govern and where we no longer govern, depends upon the opinion which is entertained of the way in which this country acts and the way in which Englishmen act.

</blockquote>
<p><a href="/wiki/Denis_Healey" title="Denis Healey">Denis Healey</a>, MP from 1952 to 1992, later said this speech was "the greatest parliamentary speech I ever heard... it had all the moral passion and rhetorical force of <a href="/wiki/Demosthenes" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>".<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" title="The Daily Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a></i> report of the speech said that "as Mr Powell sat down, he put his hand across his eyes.

In 1993 however Powell claimed that his policy could have worked but had not. He claimed the criminally insane should have never been released and that the problem was one of funding. He said the new way of caring for the mentally ill would cost more, not less, than the old way because community care was decentralised and intimate as well as being "more human". His successors had not, Powell claimed, provided the money for local authorities to spend on mental health care and therefore institutional care had been run-down whilst at the same time there was no investment in community care.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In his first speech to the Conservative Party conference as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence on 14 October 1965, Powell outlined a fresh defence policy, jettisoning what he saw as outdated global military commitments left-over from Britain's imperial past and stressing that Britain was a European power and therefore an alliance with Western European states from possible attack from the East was central to Britain's safety. He defended Britain's nuclear weapons (he did not yet advocate unilateral nuclear disarmament) and argued that it was "the merest casuistry to argue that if the weapon and the means of using it are purchased in part, or even altogether, from another nation, therefore the independent right to use it has no reality. With a weapon so catastrophic, it is possession and the right to use which count".<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> Also, Powell called into question Western military commitments <a href="/wiki/East_of_Suez" title="East of Suez">East of Suez</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"However much we may do to safeguard and reassure the new independent countries in Asia and Africa, the eventual limits of Russian and Chinese advance in those directions will be fixed by a balance of forces which will itself be Asiatic and African. The two Communist empires are already in a state of mutual antagonism; but every advance or threat of advance by one or the other calls into existence countervailing forces, sometimes nationalist in character, sometimes expansionist, which will ultimately check it. We have to reckon with the harsh fact that the attainment of this eventual equilibrium of forces may at some point be delayed rather than hastened by Western military presence".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated6_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated6-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> journalist <a href="/wiki/David_Howell,_Baron_Howell_of_Guildford" title="David Howell, Baron Howell of Guildford">David Howell</a> remarked to Andrew Alexander that Powell had "just withdrawn us from East of Suez, and received an enormous ovation because no-one understood what he was talking about".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated6_43-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated6-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> However the Americans were worried by Powell's speech as they wanted British military commitments in South-East Asia as they were still fighting in Vietnam.

The <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times" class="mw-redirect">New York Times</a></i> said Powell's speech was "a potential declaration of independence from American policy".<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> During the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1966" title="United Kingdom general election, 1966">election campaign of 1966</a> Powell claimed that the British government had contingency plans to send at least a token British force to Vietnam and that, under Labour, Britain "has behaved perfectly clearly and perfectly recognisably as an American satellite". <a href="/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="Lyndon B.

<p>In a controversial speech on 26 May 1967, Powell criticised Britain's post-war world role:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Powell was noted for his oratorical skills, and for being a maverick. On Saturday 20 April 1968 he made a controversial speech in Birmingham, in which he warned his audience of what he believed would be the consequences of continued unchecked immigration from the Commonwealth to Britain. It was an allusion to <a href="/wiki/Virgil" title="Virgil">Virgil</a> towards the end of the speech which has been remembered and gave the speech its common title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see 'the River <a href="/wiki/Tiber" title="Tiber">Tiber</a> foaming with much blood'. That tragic and intractable phenomenon which we watch with horror on the other side of the Atlantic but which there is interwoven with the history and existence of the States itself, is coming upon us here by our own volition and our own neglect. Indeed, it has all but come. In numerical terms, it will be of American proportions long before the end of the century. Only resolute and urgent action will avert it even now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The central political issue addressed by the speech was not immigration as such, however. It was the introduction by the Labour Government of the <a href="/wiki/Race_Relations_Act_1968" title="Race Relations Act 1968">Race Relations Act 1968</a>, which Powell found offensive and immoral. The Act would prohibit discrimination on the grounds of race in certain areas of British life, particularly housing, where many local authorities had been refusing to provide houses for immigrant families until they had lived in the country for a certain number of years.</p>
<p>One feature of his speech was the extensive quotation of a letter he had received detailing the experiences of one of his constituents in Wolverhampton. The writer described the fate of an elderly woman who was supposedly the last white person living in her street. She had repeatedly refused applications from non-whites requiring rooms-to-let, which resulted in her being called a racist outside her home and receiving excrement through her letterbox.</p>
<p>Heath sacked Powell from his <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet" title="Shadow Cabinet">Shadow Cabinet</a> the day after the speech, and he never held another senior political post. Powell received almost 120,000 (predominantly positive) letters and a <a href="/wiki/Gallup_poll" title="Gallup poll">Gallup poll</a> at the end of April showed that 74% of those asked agreed with his speech. After <i><a href="/wiki/The_Sunday_Times" title="The Sunday Times">The Sunday Times</a></i> branded his speeches "racialist", Powell sued it for <a href="/wiki/Libel" title="Libel" class="mw-redirect">libel</a>, but withdrew when he was required to provide the letters he had quoted from.</p>
<p>Powell had issued an advance copy of his speech to the media and their appearance at the speech may have been due to the fact that they realised the content was explosive.<sup id="cite_ref-Like_The_Roman_48-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Like_The_Roman-48" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In July 1965 he had come third in the Conservative Party leadership contest, obtaining only 15 votes, just below the result <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Fraser_(politician)" title="Hugh Fraser (politician)">Hugh Fraser</a> gained. After the 'Rivers of Blood' speech, however, Powell was transformed into a national public figure and won huge support across Britain. Three days after the speech, on 23 April, as the Race Relations Bill was being debated in the <a href="/wiki/British_House_of_Commons" title="British House of Commons" class="mw-redirect">House of Commons</a>, 1,000 dockers marched on Westminster protesting against Powell's "victimisation", and the next day 400 meat porters from Smithfield market handed in a 92-page petition in support of Powell.</p>

<p>Powell made a speech in <a href="/wiki/Morecambe" title="Morecambe">Morecambe</a> on 11 October 1968 on the economy, setting out alternative, radical free-market policies which would later be called the 'Morecambe Budget'. Powell used the financial year of 1968-9 to show how income tax could be halved from 8s 3d to 4s 3d in the pound (basic rate cut from 41% to 21%)<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50" title=""><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> and how capital gains tax and selective employment tax could be abolished without reducing expenditure on defence or the social services. These tax cuts required a saving of £2,855 million, and this would be funded by eradicating losses in the nationalised industries and denationalising the profit-making state concerns; ending all housing subsidies except for those who could not afford their own housing; ending all foreign aid; ending all grants and subsidies in agriculture; ending all assistance to development areas; ending all investment grants;<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51" title=""><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup> abolishing the <a href="/wiki/National_Economic_Development_Council" title="National Economic Development Council">National Economic Development Council</a> and abolishing the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Prices_and_Incomes_Board&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Prices and Incomes Board (page does not exist)">Prices and Incomes Board</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52" title=""><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup> The cuts in taxation would also allow the state to borrow from the public to spend on capital projects such as hospitals and roads and spend on the firm and humane treatment of criminals.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53" title=""><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Enoch_Powell&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: House of Lords reform">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">House of Lords reform</span></h3>
<p>The summer of 1968 saw the publication of <i>The House of Lords in the Middle Ages</i> after 20 years' work. At the press conference for its publication, Powell said if the government introduced a Bill to reform the Lords he would be its "resolute enemy".<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> Later in 1968, when the government published its Bills for the new session, Powell was angry at Heath's acceptance of the plan drawn up by the Conservative MP Iain Macleod and Labour's <a href="/wiki/Richard_Crossman" title="Richard Crossman">Richard Crossman</a> to reform the Lords, titled the Parliament (No. 2) Bill.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> Crossman, opening the debate on 19 November, said the government would reform the Lords in five ways: removing the voting rights of hereditary peers; making sure no party had a permanent majority; in normal circumstances the government of the day would have a working majority; to weaken the Lords' powers to delay laws; and to abolish their power to refuse to consent to subordinate legislation if it had been voted for by the Commons.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" title=""><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Powell spoke in the debate, opposing these plans. He said the reforms were "unnecessary and undesirable" and that there was no weight in the claim that the Lords could "check or frustrate the firm intentions" of the Commons. He claimed that only election or nomination could replace the hereditary nature of the Lords. If they were elected it would pose the dilemma of which House was truly representative of the electorate. He also had another objection: "How can the same electorate be represented in two ways so that the two sets of representatives can conflict and disagree with one another?" Those nominated would be bound to the Chief Whip of their party through a sort of oath and Powell asked "what sort of men and women are they to be who would submit to be nominated to another chamber upon condition that they will be mere dummies, automatic parts of a voting machine?" The inclusion of 30 cross-benchers was "a grand absurdity" because they would have been chosen "upon the very basis that they have no strong views of principle on the way in which the country ought to be governed".<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57" title=""><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> Powell claimed the Lords derived their authority not from a strict hereditary system but from its prescriptive nature: "It has long been so, and it works". He then added that there was no widespread desire for reform: he pointed to a recent survey of working-class voters which showed only a third of them wanted to reform or abolish the Lords, with another third believing the Lords were an "intrinsic part of the national traditions of Britain". Powell deduced from this that "As so often the ordinary rank and file of the electorate have seen a truth, an important fact, which has escaped so many more clever people – the underlying value of that which is traditional, that which is prescriptive".<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58" title=""><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After more speeches against the Bill in early 1969, and with left-wing Labour MPs against Lords reform as well (they wanted abolition), Harold Wilson announced on 17 April that the Bill was being dropped. Wilson's statement was short, with Powell intervening: "Don't eat them too quickly", which provoked much laughter in the House.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_59-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-59" title=""><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> Later that day Powell said in a speech to the <a href="/wiki/Primrose_League" title="Primrose League">Primrose League</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There was an instinct, inarticulate but deep and sound, that the traditional, prescriptive House of Lords posed no threat and injured no interests, but might yet, for all its illogicalities and anomalies, make itself felt on occasion to useful purpose. The same sound instinct was repelled by the idea of a new-fashioned second chamber, artificially constructed by power, party and patronage, to function in a particular way. Not for the first time, the common people of this country proved the surest defenders of their traditional institutions.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_59-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-59" title=""><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Powell's biographer Simon Heffer has described the defeat of Lords reform as "perhaps the greatest triumph of Powell's political career".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated5_59-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated5-59" title=""><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1969, when it was first suggested that the United Kingdom would join the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a>, Powell spoke openly of his opposition to the country joining this <a href="/wiki/Common_market" title="Common market" class="mw-redirect">common market</a>. <a href="http://www.whitewolves.org.uk/pages/Enoch%20Powell.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitewolves.org.uk/pages/Enoch%20Powell.htm" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>Powell's popularity appeared to contribute to the Conservatives' surprise victory in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1970" title="United Kingdom general election, 1970">1970 General Election</a>, which showed a late surge in Conservative support in the <a href="/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)" title="West Midlands (county)">West Midlands</a>, near Powell's constituency. In "exhaustive research" on the election, the American pollster Douglas Schoen and <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a> academic R.W. Johnson believed it "beyond dispute" that Enoch Powell had attracted 2.5 million votes to the Conservatives. Johnson later wrote that "It became clear that Powell had won the 1970 election for the Tories... of all those who had switched their vote from one party to another in the election, 50 per cent were working class Powellites. Not only had 18 per cent of Labour Powellites switched to the Tories but so had 24 per cent of Liberal Powellites". Johnson further believed that the votes Powell brought to the Conservatives were "quite possibly four or five million".<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> A <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Express" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a></i> poll in 1972 showed Powell being the most popular politician in the country.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title=""><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In a defence debate in March 1970 he claimed that "the whole theory of the tactical nuclear weapon, or the tactical use of nuclear weapons, is an unmitigated absurdity" and that it was "remotely improbable" that any group of nations engaged in war would "decide upon general and mutual suicide" and called for enlargement of Britain's continental army. However when fellow Conservative <a href="/wiki/Julian_Amery" title="Julian Amery" class="mw-redirect">Julian Amery</a> later in the debate criticised Powell for his anti-nuclear pronouncements, Powell responded: "I have always regarded the possession of the nuclear capability as a protection against nuclear blackmail. It is a protection against being threatened with nuclear weapons. What it is not a protection against is war".<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup> However, Powell would later criticise this theory of nuclear deterrence.</p>
<p>Powell had voted against the <a href="/wiki/Schuman_Declaration" title="Schuman Declaration">Schuman plan</a> in 1950 and had supported entry only because he believed that the Common Market was simply a means to secure free trade. In March 1969 he turned forcefully against Britain's joining the <a href="/wiki/European_Economic_Community" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a>. Opposition to entry had hitherto been confined largely to the Labour Party but now, he said, it was clear to him that the sovereignty of Parliament was in question, as was Britain's very survival as a nation. This nationalist analysis attracted millions of grass-roots Conservatives and others, and as much as anything else made Powell the implacable enemy of Heath, a fervent pro-European, but there was already a deep enmity between the two.</p>
<p>The Conservatives had promised at the 1970 election<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> that in relation to the Common Market "Our sole commitment is to negotiate; no more, no less". When Powell saw Heath sign an accession treaty before Parliament had even debated the issue, when the second reading of the Bill to put the Treaty into law passed by just eight votes on second reading, and when it became clear that the British people would have no further say in the matter, he declared open war on his party's line. He voted against the government on every one of the 104 divisions in the course of the European Communities Bill. When finally he lost this battle, he decided he could no longer sit in a parliament that he believed was no longer sovereign. In the summer of 1972 he prepared to resign, and changed his mind only because of fears of a renewed wave of immigration from <a href="/wiki/Uganda" title="Uganda">Uganda</a> following the rise of <a href="/wiki/Idi_Amin" title="Idi Amin">Idi Amin</a>, who had expelled Uganda's Asian residents.</p>
<p>In 1972, the same year that he publicly spoke of his opposition to the immigration of Ugandan Asians, Powell was also defeated in his fight against the <a href="/w/index.php?title=European_Communities_Bill&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="European Communities Bill (page does not exist)">European Communities Bill</a>, which paved the way for the United Kingdom to join the common market that he had spent three years campaigning to prevent from happening.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64" title=""><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>However, in February 1974 Powell left the Conservative Party, mainly because it had taken the UK into the EEC and because it abandoned its manifesto commitments and he therefore could not stand in support of it at <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_February_1974" title="United Kingdom general election, February 1974">the election</a>. The monetarist economist <a href="/wiki/Milton_Friedman" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> sent Powell a letter praising his stance as principled.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65" title=""><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup> Powell had his friend Andrew Alexander talk with Labour Party leader Harold Wilson's press secretary, <a href="/wiki/Joe_Haines" title="Joe Haines">Joe Haines</a>, on Powell's timing of his speeches against Heath. Powell had been talking with Wilson irregularly since June 1973 during chance meetings in the gentlemen's toilets of the aye lobby in the House of Commons.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66" title=""><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> Wilson and Haines had ensured that Powell would dominate the newspapers of the Sunday and Monday before election day by having no Labour front bencher give a major speech on 23 February, the day of Powell's speech.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67" title=""><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> Powell gave this speech at the Mecca Dance Hall in the <a href="/wiki/Bull_Ring,_Birmingham" title="Bull Ring, Birmingham">Bull Ring, Birmingham</a> to an audience of 1,500, with some press reports estimating that 7,000 had to be turned away. Powell said the issue of British membership of the EEC was one where "if there be a conflict between the call of country and that of party, the call of country must come first":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Curiously, it so happens that the question 'Who governs Britain?' which at the moment is being frivolously posed, might be taken, in real earnest, as the title of what I have to say. This is the first and last election at which the British people will be given the opportunity to decide whether their country is to remain a democratic nation, governed by the will of its own electorate expressed in its own Parliament, or whether it will become one province in a new European superstate under institutions which know nothing of the political rights and liberties that we have so long taken for granted".<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68" title=""><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Powell went on to criticise the Conservative Party for obtaining British membership despite promising at the general election that they would "negotiate: no more, no less" and that Britain needed "the full-hearted consent of Parliament and people" if Britain were to join. He also denounced Heath for accusing his political opponents of lacking respect for Parliament whilst being "the first Prime Minister in three hundred years who entertained, let alone executed, the intention of depriving Parliament of its sole right to make the laws and impose the taxes of this country".<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69" title=""><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup> He then advocated a vote for the Labour Party:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The question is: can they now be prevented from taking back into their own hands the decision about their identity and their form of government which truly was theirs all along? I do not believe they can be prevented: for they are now, at a general election, provided with a clear, definite and practicable alternative, namely, a fundamental renegotiation directed to regain free access to world food markets and recover or retain the powers of Parliament, a renegotiation to be followed in any event by a specific submission of the outcome to the electorate, a renegotiation protected by an immediate moratorium or stop on all further integration of the UK into the Community. This alternative is offered, as such an alternative must be in our parliamentary democracy, by a political party capable of securing a majority in the House of Commons and sustaining a Government".<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70" title=""><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This call to vote Labour shocked some of Powell's supporters who were more concerned with beating socialism than the loss of national independence.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71" title=""><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup> On 25 February he made another speech at <a href="/wiki/Shipley" title="Shipley">Shipley</a> urging a vote for Labour and saying he did not believe the claim that Wilson would U-turn on his commitment to renegotiation, which to Powell was ironic considering Heath's premiership: "In acrobatics Harold Wilson, for all his nimbleness and skill, is simply no match for the breathtaking, thoroughgoing efficiency of the present Prime Minister". At this moment a heckler shouted out "Judas!" Powell responded: "Judas was paid! Judas was paid! I am making a sacrifice!"<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72" title=""><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup> Later in the speech Powell said: "I was born a Tory, am a Tory and shall die a Tory. It is part of me... it is something I cannot alter".<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73" title=""><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1987 Powell said there was no contradiction between urging people to vote Labour whilst proclaiming to be a Tory: "Many Labour members are quite good Tories".<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74" title=""><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In a sudden <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_October_1974" title="United Kingdom general election, October 1974">general election in October 1974</a>, Powell returned to Parliament as <a href="/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party" title="Ulster Unionist Party">Ulster Unionist</a> MP for <a href="/wiki/South_Down_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="South Down (UK Parliament constituency)">South Down</a>, having rejected an offer to stand as a candidate for the <a href="/wiki/British_National_Front" title="British National Front">National Front</a>.

<p>Since 1968 Powell had been an increasingly frequent visitor to <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, and in keeping with his general British nationalist viewpoint he sided strongly with the Ulster Unionists in their desire to remain a constituent part of the United Kingdom. From early 1971 he opposed, with increasing vehemence, Heath's approach to Northern Ireland, the greatest breach with his party coming over the imposition of direct rule in 1972. He was a strong believer in the United Kingdom, and he believed that it would survive only if the <a href="/wiki/Unionists_(Ireland)" title="Unionists (Ireland)" class="mw-redirect">Unionists</a> strove to integrate fully with the United Kingdom by abandoning the devolved rule that Northern Ireland had until recently enjoyed.

During its second reading Powell warned of passing legislation "in haste and under the immediate pressure of indignation on matters which touch the fundamental liberties of the subject; for both haste and anger are ill counsellors, especially when one is legislating for the rights of the subject".

<p>When Heath called a <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)_leadership_election,_1975" title="Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1975">leadership election</a> at the end of 1974, Powell claimed they would have to find someone who was not a member of the Cabinet "which, without a single resignation or public dissent, not merely swallowed but advocated every single reversal of election pledge or party principle".<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80" title=""><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The government won by 322 votes to 298, and remained in power for another two years.</p>
<p>During 1983 his local agent was <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Donaldson" title="Jeffrey Donaldson">Jeffrey Donaldson</a>, later an Ulster Unionist MP before defecting to the DUP.</p>
<p>Powell claimed that the only way to stop the PIRA was for Northern Ireland to be an integral part of the United Kingdom, treated no differently from any other of its constituent parts. He claimed the ambiguous nature of the province's status, with its own <a href="/wiki/Parliament_Building_of_Northern_Ireland" title="Parliament Building of Northern Ireland" class="mw-redirect">parliament</a> and <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland" title="Prime Minister of Northern Ireland">prime minister</a>, gave hope to the PIRA that it could be detached from the rest of the UK:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Every word or act which holds out the prospect that their unity with the rest of the United Kingdom might be negotiable is itself, consciously or unconsciously, a contributory cause to the continuation of violence in Northern Ireland".<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81" title=""><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Powell's later career as an Ulster Unionist MP he continued to criticise the United States, and claimed that the Americans were trying to persuade the British to push Northern Ireland into an all-Ireland state because the condition for Irish membership of NATO, Powell claimed, was Northern Ireland. The Americans wanted to close the 'yawning gap' in NATO defence that was the southern Irish coast to northern Spain. Powell had a copy of <a href="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1950v03.p1493" class="external text" title="http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=FRUS.FRUS1950v03.p1493" rel="nofollow">a State Department Policy Statement</a> from 15 August 1950 in which the American government said that the 'agitation' caused by partition in Ireland "lessens the usefulness of Ireland in international organisations and complicates strategic planning for Europe". "It is desirable", the document continued, "that Ireland should be integrated into the defense planning of the North Atlantic area, for its strategic position and present lack of defensive capacity are matters of significance.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82" title=""><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In February 1975, after winning the leadership election, <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> refused to offer Powell a Shadow Cabinet place because "he turned his back on his own people" by leaving the Conservative Party exactly 12 months earlier and telling the electorate to vote Labour. Powell replied she was correct to do that: "In the first place I am not a member of the Conservative Party and secondly, until the Conservative Party has worked its passage a very long way it will not be rejoining me".<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83" title=""><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup>.

<p>Though he voted with the Conservatives in a vote of confidence that brought down the Labour government on 28 March, Powell did not welcome the victory of Margaret Thatcher in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979" title="United Kingdom general election, 1979">May 1979 election</a>. "Grim" was Powell's response when he was asked what he thought of Thatcher's victory. During the election campaign, Thatcher again said that there would be no place for Powell in her cabinet if the Conservatives won the General Election. Powell later came to appreciate and praise Thatcher's patience and tenacity in getting her own way, and although he was on supposedly good terms with Thatcher (she claimed her own monetarist policies stemmed from Powell's, to which he remarked drily, "A pity she did not understand them!"), he remained at odds with Thatcher over her pro-American foreign policy and her support for <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapons" title="Nuclear weapons" class="mw-redirect">nuclear weapons</a>. She also dismissed his claims over <a href="/wiki/Airey_Neave" title="Airey Neave">Airey Neave</a>'s and <a href="/wiki/Lord_Mountbatten" title="Lord Mountbatten" class="mw-redirect">Lord Mountbatten</a>'s murders.</p>
<p>Powell came into conflict with Thatcher in November 1985 because of her support for the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Irish_Agreement" title="Anglo-Irish Agreement">Anglo-Irish Agreement</a>, resigning his seat in protest and then regaining it at the <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland_by-elections,_1986" title="Northern Ireland by-elections, 1986">ensuing by-election</a>.</p>
<p>However, he had backed Mrs Thatcher for declaring <a href="/wiki/Falklands_War" title="Falklands War">war</a> on <a href="/wiki/Argentina" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> in April 1982 following their invasion of the <a href="/wiki/Falkland_Islands" title="Falkland Islands">Falkland Islands</a> - a conflict with the United Kingdom won just over two months later. <a href="http://www.whitewolves.org.uk/pages/Enoch%20Powell.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitewolves.org.uk/pages/Enoch%20Powell.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>After Mrs Thatcher's Bruges speech<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85" title=""><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup> in September 1988 and her increasing hostility to the abolition of the pound sterling in the last years of her premiership, Powell made many speeches publicly supporting her attitude to Europe. In early September 1989 a collection of Powell's speeches on Europe was published titled <i>Enoch Powell on 1992</i> (1992 being the year set for the European Single Market). In a speech at <a href="/wiki/Chatham_House" title="Chatham House">Chatham House</a> for the launch of the book on 6 September, he advised Thatcher to fight the next general election on a nationalist theme as many Eastern European nations previously under Russian rule were gaining their freedom.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_86-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-86" title=""><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup> At the Conservative Party conference in October he told a fringe meeting: "I find myself today less on the fringe of that party than I have done for 20 years".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_86-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-86" title=""><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup> On 5 January 1990, addressing Conservatives in Liverpool, Powell claimed that if the Conservatives played the "British card" at the next general election they could win; that the new mood in Britain for "self-determination" had given the newly independent nations of Eastern Europe a "beacon", adding that Britain should stand alone, if necessary, for European freedom.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated2_87-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated2-87" title=""><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup> Five days after this speech, in an interview for <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, Thatcher praised Powell: "I have always read Enoch Powell's speeches and articles very carefully... I always think it was a tragedy that he left. He is a very, very able politician. I say that even though he has sometimes said vitriolic things against me".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated2_87-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated2-87" title=""><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the 1980s Powell began espousing the policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. In a debate on the nuclear deterrent on 3 March 1981 Powell claimed that the debate was now more political than military; that Britain did not possess an independent deterrent and that through NATO Britain was tied to the nuclear deterrence theory of the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89" title=""><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup> In the debate on the address shortly after the general election of 1983, Powell picked up on Thatcher's willingness, when asked, to use nuclear weapons in the "last resort". Powell gave a scenario of what he though the last resort would be, namely that the Soviet Union would be ready to invade Britain and had used a nuclear weapon on somewhere such as <a href="/wiki/Rockall" title="Rockall">Rockall</a> to demonstrate their willingness to use it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What would the United Kingdom do? Would it discharge Polaris, Trident or whatever against the main centres of population of the Continent of Europe or in European Russia? If so, what would be the consequence? The consequence would not be that we should survive, that we should repel our antagonist – nor would it be that we should escape defeat. The consequence would be that we would make certain, as far as is humanly possible, the virtual destruction and elimination of the hope of the future in these islands.... I would much sooner that the power to use it was not in the hands of any individual in this country at all".<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90" title=""><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Powell went on to say that if the Soviet invasion had already begun and Britain deployed a retaliatory strike the results would be the same: "We should be condemning, not merely to death, but as near as may be the non-existence of our population". To Powell an invasion would take place with or without Britain's nuclear weapons and therefore there was no point in retaining it. He said that after years of consideration he had come to the conclusion that there was no "rational grounds on which the deformation of our defence preparations in the United Kingdom by our determination to maintain a current independent nuclear deterrent can be justified".<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91" title=""><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1984, Powell also claimed that the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> had murdered <a href="/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma" title="Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma">Earl Mountbatten of Burma</a> and that the deaths of the MPs <a href="/wiki/Airey_Neave" title="Airey Neave">Airey Neave</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Bradford_(NI_politician)" title="Robert Bradford (NI politician)" class="mw-redirect">Robert Bradford</a> were carried out by the USA in order to stop Neave's policy of integration for Northern Ireland.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92" title=""><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup> Then in 1986 he again argued that <a href="/wiki/Irish_National_Liberation_Army" title="Irish National Liberation Army">Irish National Liberation Army</a> (INLA) had not killed Airey Neave but that "<a href="/wiki/MI6" title="MI6" class="mw-redirect">MI6</a> and their friends" were responsible instead, claiming to have been told so by RUC officers.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93" title=""><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Enoch Powell lost his seat in the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1987" title="United Kingdom general election, 1987">1987 general election</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Social_Democratic_Labour_Party" title="Social Democratic Labour Party">Social Democratic Labour Party</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Eddie_McGrady" title="Eddie McGrady">Eddie McGrady</a>, mainly due to demographic and boundary changes which resulted in there being many more Catholics in the constituency than before. Ironically, the boundary changes had arisen due to his own campaign for the number of MPs representing Northern Ireland to be increased to the equivalent proportion for the rest of the United Kingdom, as part of the steps towards greater integration. He was offered a life peerage, which was regarded as his right as a former cabinet minister, but declined it. He argued that, as he had opposed the <a href="/wiki/Life_Peerages_Act_1958" title="Life Peerages Act 1958">Life Peerages Act 1958</a>, it would be hypocritical for him to take one.</p>

He also went to a veterans' parade (wearing his own medals) and talked with Russian soldiers with the aid of an interpreter. However the programme was criticised by those who believed that Powell had dismissed the Soviet Union's threat to the West since 1945, so impressed had he been with Russia's sense of national identity.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated7_96-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated7-96" title=""><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>When <a href="/wiki/German_reunification" title="German reunification">German reunification</a> was on the agenda in 1990, Powell claimed that Britain urgently needed to create an alliance with the Soviet Union in view of Germany's effect on the balance of power in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated7_96-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated7-96" title=""><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After <a href="/wiki/Iraqi_invasion_of_Kuwait" title="Iraqi invasion of Kuwait" class="mw-redirect">Iraq invaded Kuwait</a> on 2 August 1990, Powell claimed that, because Britain was not an ally of Kuwait in the "formal sense" and because the <a href="/wiki/Balance_of_power_in_international_relations" title="Balance of power in international relations">balance of power</a> in the Middle East had ceased to be a British concern after the end of the British Empire, Britain should not go to war.

<p>In the autumn of 1992, at the age of 80, Powell was diagnosed as suffering from <a href="/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease" title="Parkinson's disease">Parkinson's disease</a>. 1994 was marked by the publication of <i>The Evolution of the Gospel, A New Translation of the First Gospel with Commentary and Introductory Essay</i>. During the final years of his life he managed occasional pieces of journalism and co-operated in a <a href="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> documentary about his life in 1995. When Labour won the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997" title="United Kingdom general election, 1997">1997 General Election</a>, Powell told his wife that the electorate had voted to break up the United Kingdom. By this time Powell had been hospitalised several times as a result of a succession of falls.

<p>Despite his earlier militant <a href="/wiki/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheism</a> Powell became a devout <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Anglican</a>, having thought in 1949 "that he heard the bells of <a href="/wiki/St_Peter%27s_Wolverhampton" title="St Peter's Wolverhampton" class="mw-redirect">St Peter's Wolverhampton</a> calling him" (Heffer p. 130) while walking to his flat in his (then future) constituency. Subsequently, he became a churchwarden of <a href="/wiki/St._Margaret%27s,_Westminster" title="St. Margaret's, Westminster">St Margaret's, Westminster</a>. He spent much of his later life trying to prove, with close textual reading, that Christ had not been <a href="/wiki/Crucified" title="Crucified" class="mw-redirect">crucified</a> but stoned to death.</p>
<p>Powell was reading Ancient Greek by the age of five, learning it from his mother. At age 70 he began learning his 12th and final language, Hebrew.</p>
<p>In August 2002 Powell appeared in the List of <a href="/wiki/100_Greatest_Britons" title="100 Greatest Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a> of all time (voted for by the public in a BBC nationwide poll).</p>
<p>Powell had remarked that "all political lives end in failure" and did not hesitate to agree that this maxim applied to his own. Like <a href="/wiki/Tony_Benn" title="Tony Benn">Tony Benn</a> (a personal friend from a different political background, whom Powell had helped to renounce his <a href="/wiki/Peerage" title="Peerage">peerage</a> and so remain an elected Member of Parliament), he was seen by supporters as putting conscience and duty to his constituents before loyalty to his party or the sake of his career.</p>
<p>Powell's rhetorical gifts were also employed, with success, beyond politics. He was a poet of some accomplishment, with four published collections to his name: <i>First Poems</i>; <i>Casting Off</i>; <i>Dancer's End</i>; and <i>The Wedding Gift</i>. His <i>Collected Poems</i> appeared in 1990. He translated <a href="/wiki/Herodotus" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> (<i>The History of Herodotus</i>) and published many other works of classical scholarship. He published a biography of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain" title="Joseph Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, which treated the split with Gladstone over Irish Home Rule in 1886 as the pivotal point of his career, rather than the adoption of Tariff Reform, and which contained the famous line that "all political careers, unless they are cut off at some happy juncture, end in failure". Powell published many books on political matters too, which were often annotated collections of his speeches. His political publications were often as critical of his own party as they were of Labour, often making fun of what he saw as logical fallacies in reasoning or action. His book <i>Freedom &amp; Reality</i> contained many quotes from Labour party manifestos or by <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> which he regarded as nonsensical.</p>

<p>Powell said "I have and always will set my face like flint against making any difference between one citizen of this country and another on grounds of his origins."<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98" title=""><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup> In <i>The Trial of Enoch Powell</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Channel_4" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> television broadcast in April 1998, on the thirtieth anniversary of his Birmingham speech (and two months after his death), 64% of the studio audience voted that Powell was not a racist. However, some in the Church took a different view: upon his death the <a href="/wiki/Wilfred_Wood_(bishop)" title="Wilfred Wood (bishop)">Bishop of Croydon</a> stated "Enoch Powell gave a certificate of respectability to white racist views which otherwise decent people were ashamed to acknowledge."<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99" title=""><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The conservative commentator <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Anderson_(columnist)" title="Bruce Anderson (columnist)">Bruce Anderson</a> has noted that the "Rivers of Blood" speech would have come as a complete surprise to anyone who had studied his record: he had been a West Midlands MP for 18 years but had said hardly anything about immigration. On this view, the speech was merely part of a badly miscalculated strategy to become party leader if Ted Heath should fall. Anderson adds that the speech had no effect on immigration, except to make it more difficult for the subject to be discussed rationally in polite society.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100" title=""><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Powell's detractors often assert that he was 'far-right', 'proto-fascist' or 'racist'. The first two charges clash with his voting record on most social issues, such as <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" title="Homosexuality">homosexual</a> law reform - he was actually co-sponsor of a Bill on this issue in May 1965 - and the abolition of the <a href="/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_Kingdom#Abolition" title="Capital punishment in the United Kingdom">death penalty</a>, both liberal reforms which had limited support in the Conservative Party at the time, although he did little to call public attention to his stance on these non-party "issues of conscience".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated3_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated3-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>He voted against the return of the death penalty in 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1983 and 1987. Although substantial sections of the public supported Powell on the issues for which he was better known, most of the "liberal intelligentsia" tended to denounce him as a racist. For some, this charge seems unconvincing in the light of Powell's pre-political actions<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101" title=""><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup>, and it was not until the late 1960s that he made speeches on immigration and nationality. On this view, he is perhaps better classified as a romantic British nationalist than any sort of fascist: like <a href="/wiki/Michael_Foot" title="Michael Foot">Michael Foot</a> from the other end of the political spectrum (with whom he joined forces on constitutional issues such as defeating House of Lords reform<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102" title=""><span>[</span>103<span>]</span></a></sup> and opposing Britain's entry to the European Community), he was an ardent constitutionalist, worshipping Parliament as the cradle of democracy, whereas most actual fascists want to abolish the democratic institutions.</p>
<p>Powell's speeches and TV interviews throughout his political life displayed a suspicion towards "<a href="/wiki/The_Establishment" title="The Establishment">the Establishment</a>" in general, and by the 1980s there was a regular expectation that he would make some sort of speech or act in a way designed to upset the government and ensure he would not be offered a <a href="/wiki/Life_peer" title="Life peer">life peerage</a> (and thus be transferred to the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Lords" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>), which he had no intention of accepting so long as Edward Heath sat in the Commons. (Heath remained in the Commons until after Powell's death.) He had opposed the 1958 Life Peerages Act and felt it would be hypocritical to accept a life peerage himself, while no Prime Minister was ever willing to offer him a <a href="/wiki/Hereditary_peer" title="Hereditary peer">hereditary peerage</a>.</p>

<p>The South African-born British musician <a href="/wiki/Manfred_Mann_(musician)" title="Manfred Mann (musician)">Manfred Mann</a> released an instrumental track entitled "Konekuf" ("Fuk Enok" backwards) in the 1970s, indicating his opinion of Powell. <a href="/wiki/John_Cale" title="John Cale">John Cale</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Graham_Greene" title="Graham Greene">Graham Greene</a>" also mentions Powell, although the context is more obscure, and in 1970 <a href="/wiki/Ska" title="Ska">ska</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reggae" title="Reggae">reggae</a> singer <a href="/wiki/Millie_(singer)" title="Millie (singer)">Millie</a> sang "Enoch Power" against Powell.

The Beatles ultimately decided against releasing the song in this earlier form, fearing that the ironic intent might go over some people's heads and that the song might lead listeners to mistakenly believe that the group were actually endorsing Powell's views rather than criticising them.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since December 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>Powell's name was mentioned in some of the more daring BBC comedies of the 1960s and 1970s, e.g. in several <i><a href="/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus" title="Monty Python's Flying Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></i> skits, including "Travel Agent" and "Election Special".

More encompassing and more accurate, however, is the inclusion of the entire 19th century and to the end of the Mexican Revolution in 1920.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Through treaties with foreign nations and native peoples, political compromise, technological innovation, military conquest, establishment of law and order, and the great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from the coast to the coast (Atlantic Ocean-to-Pacific Ocean), fulfilling its belief in <a href="/wiki/Manifest_Destiny" title="Manifest Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a>. In securing and managing the West, the U.S. federal government greatly expanded its powers, as the nation grew from an agrarian society to an industrialized nation. First promoting settlement and exploitation of the land, by the end of the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" title="19th century">19th century</a> the federal government became a steward of the remaining open spaces. As the American Old West passed into history, the myths of the West took firm hold in the imagination of Americans and foreigners alike.</p>

<p>The American <a href="/wiki/Frontier" title="Frontier">frontier</a> moved gradually westward decades after the settlement of the first white immigrants on the Eastern seaboard in the 1600s. The "West" was always the area beyond that boundary. Scholars, however, sometimes refer to the "Old West" as the region of the Ohio and Tennessee valleys during the 18th century, when the frontier was being contested by England, France, and the American colonies. Most often, however, the "American Old West", the "Old West" or "the Great West" is used to describe the area west of the <a href="/wiki/Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> during the 19th century.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>From the time of European settlement of North America in the seventeenth century, the western frontier was the initial geographical impediment to expansion, the crest of the <a href="/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains" title="Appalachian Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>. While the eastern seaboard was being tamed, little concern and speculation was given the area over these mountains. After independence, migration began en masse over the Appalachians and the western frontier moved further west to the next great geographical boundary. After the Revolutionary War, the conflict among European powers over the vast American continent and its riches gave way to the new nation of the United States. With peace came an impetus for westward expansion, as veterans returned to areas seen during the war, and land hungry settlers traveled to newly available lands in New York and across the Appalachians.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 19th century, the American frontier was approximately along the Mississippi River, which bisects the continental United States north-to-south from just west of the Great Lakes to the delta near New Orleans. <a href="/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> was the largest town on the frontier, the gateway for travel westward, and a principal trading center for Mississippi River traffic and inland commerce.</p>
<p>The new nation began to exercise some power in domestic and foreign affairs. The British had been driven out of the East after the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> but remained in Canada and threatened to expand into the Northwest. The French had left the Ohio Valley but still owned the Louisiana Territory from the Mississippi River west to the Rockies, including the strategic port of <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>. Spain's dominion (<a href="/wiki/New_Spain" title="New Spain" class="mw-redirect">New Spain</a>) included Florida and the territories from present-day Texas to California along the southern tier and up to what later would be Utah and Colorado.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>With a stroke of the pen, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, the third president of the United States, elected in 1801, more than doubled the size of the United States. The <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase" title="Louisiana Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> of 1803 comprised land which France had acquired from Spain just three years earlier. <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte" title="Napoleon Bonaparte" class="mw-redirect">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> had begun to consider it a liability, since the <a href="/wiki/Haitian_Revolution" title="Haitian Revolution">slave rebellion in Haiti</a> and tropical disease undermined his Caribbean adventures. <a href="/wiki/Robert_Livingston_(1746-1813)" title="Robert Livingston (1746-1813)" class="mw-redirect">Robert R. Livingston</a>, American ambassador to France, negotiated the sale with French foreign minister <a href="/wiki/Talleyrand" title="Talleyrand" class="mw-redirect">Talleyrand</a>, who stated, "You have made a noble bargain for yourselves, and I suppose you will make the most of it."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The price was $23 million (about $0.04 per acre), including the cost of settling all claims against France by American citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The purchase was controversial. <a href="/wiki/Federalist" title="Federalist">Federalists</a> thought that the territory was "a vast wilderness world which will... prove worse than useless to us" and spread the population across an ungovernable land, weakening federal power. But the Jeffersonians thought the territory would help maintain their vision of the ideal republican society, based on agricultural commerce, governed lightly and promoting self-reliance and virtue.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Jefferson quickly ordered <a href="/wiki/List_of_explorers" title="List of explorers">exploration</a> and documentation of the vast territory. He charged <a href="/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark" title="Lewis and Clark" class="mw-redirect">Lewis and Clark</a> to lead an expedition, starting in 1804, to "explore the Missouri river, and such principal stream of it, as, by its course and communication with the waters of the Pacific ocean; whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct and practicable communication across the continent for the purposes of commerce."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Jefferson also instructed the expedition to study the region's native tribes, weather, soil, rivers, commercial trading, and animal and plant life.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The principal commercial goal was to find an efficient route to connect American goods and natural resources with Asian markets, and perhaps to find a means of blocking the growth of British fur trading companies into the <a href="/wiki/Oregon_Country" title="Oregon Country">Oregon Country</a>. Asian merchants were already buying sea otter pelts from Pacific coast traders for Chinese customers. An expansion of inland fur trading was also anticipated.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> With news spreading of the expedition's findings, entrepreneurs like <a href="/wiki/John_Jacob_Astor" title="John Jacob Astor">John Jacob Astor</a> immediately seized the opportunity and expanded fur trading operations into the <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" title="Pacific Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>. Astor's "<a href="/wiki/Fort_Astoria" title="Fort Astoria">Fort Astoria</a>" (later Fort George), at the mouth of the Columbia River, became the first permanent white settlement in that area. However, during the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>, the rival North West Company (a British-Canadian company) bought the camp from Astor's agents as they feared the British would destroy an American camp. For a while, Astor's fur business suffered. But he rebounded by 1820, took over independent traders to create a powerful monopoly, and left the business as a multi-millionaire in 1834, reinvesting his money in Manhattan real estate.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

This competition was one of the contributing factors to the <a href="/wiki/French_and_Indian_War" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a> in 1763. British victory in the war led to the expulsion of the French from the American colonies. French trading continued, however, based in <a href="/wiki/Montreal" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a> did little to change the boundaries of the United States and British territories, but its conclusion led to the nations' agreement to make the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lakes" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> neutral waters to both navies. Furthermore, competing commercial claims by England and the U.S. led to the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-American_Convention_of_1818" title="Anglo-American Convention of 1818" class="mw-redirect">Anglo-American Convention of 1818</a>. This resulted in their sharing the Oregon territory until a decades later resolution. By 1820, with the fur trade depressed, distances to supply increasing, and conflicts with native tribes rising, the trading system was overhauled by <a href="/wiki/Donald_Mackenzie_(explorer)" title="Donald Mackenzie (explorer)">Donald Mackenzie</a> of the North West Company and by William H. Ashley. Previously, Indians caught the animals, skinned them, and brought the furs to trading posts such as <a href="/wiki/Fort_Lisa" title="Fort Lisa">Fort Lisa</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fontenelle%27s_Post" title="Fontenelle's Post">Fontenelle's Post</a>, where trappers sent the goods down river to St. Louis. In exchange for the furs, Indians typically received calico cloth, knives, tomahawks, awls, beads, rifles, ammunition, animal traps, rum, whiskey, and salt pork.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The new "brigade-rendezvous" system, however, sent company men in "brigades" cross-country on long expeditions, bypassing Indian tribes. It also encouraged "free trappers" to explore new regions on their own. At the end of the gathering season, the trappers would "rendezvous" and turn in their goods for pay at river ports along the <a href="/wiki/Green_River" title="Green River">Green River</a>, the Upper Missouri, and the Upper Mississippi. St. Louis was the largest of the rendezvous towns. An early chronicle described the gathering as "one continued scene of drunkenness, gambling, and brawling and fighting, as long as the money and the credit of the trappers last." Trappers competed in wrestling and shooting matches. When they would gamble away all their furs, horses, and their equipment, they would lament, "There goes hos and beaver." By 1830, however, fashions changed in Europe and beaver hats were replaced by silk hats, sharply reducing the need for American furs.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Thus ended the era of the "Mountain men", trappers and scouts such as <a href="/wiki/Jedediah_Smith" title="Jedediah Smith">Jedediah Smith</a> (who had traveled through more unexplored western land than any non-Indian and was the first American to reach California overland).

<p>While the profit motive dominated the movement westward, the Federal government played a vital role in securing land and maintaining law and order, which allowed the expansion to proceed. Despite the Jeffersonian aversion and mistrust of federal power, it bore more heavily in the West than any other region, and made possible the fulfillment of <a href="/wiki/Manifest_Destiny" title="Manifest Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a>. Since local governments were often absent or weak, Westerners, though they grumbled about it, depended on the federal government to protect them and their rights, and displayed little of the outright antipathy of some Easterners to Federalism.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The federal government established a sequence of actions related to control over western lands. First, it acquired western territory from other nations or native tribes by treaty; then it sent surveyors and explorers to map and document the land; next, ordered federal troops to clear out and subdue the resisting natives; and finally, had bureaucracies manage the land, such as the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Indian_Affairs" title="Bureau of Indian Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Land_Office" title="Land Office" class="mw-redirect">Land Office</a>, the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Geological_Survey" title="U.S. Geological Survey" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Geological Survey</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Forest_Service" title="United States Forest Service">Forest Service</a>. The process was not a smooth one. Indian resistance, sectionalism, and racism forced some pauses in the process of westward settlement. Nonetheless, by the end of the 19th century, in the process of conquering and managing the West, the federal government amassed great size, power, and influence in national affairs.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><i>Criollo</i> and <i>mestizo</i> settlers of New Spain declared their independence in 1810 (finally obtaining it in 1821), crumbling Spanish colonial empire in the <a href="/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">Americas</a> (at that moment called just America, since it was seen as just one continent), forming the new nation of <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> which included the New Mexico territory at its north. A hoped for result of Mexico's independence was more open trade and better relations with the United States where previously Spain had enforced its border strictly and had arrested American traders who ventured into the region. After Mexico's independence, large caravans began delivering goods to Santa Fe along the <a href="/wiki/Santa_Fe_Trail" title="Santa Fe Trail">Santa Fe Trail</a>, over the 870-mile (1,400&#160;km) journey which took 48 days from Kansas City, Missouri (then known as Westport).<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> Santa Fe was also the trailhead for the "El Camino Real" (the King's Highway), a major trade route which carried American manufactured goods southward deep into Mexico and returned silver, furs, and mules northward (not to be confused with another "Camino Real" which connected the missions in California).

<p>The expansion of migration into the Southeast in the 1820s and 1830's forced the federal government to deal with the "Indian question." By 1837, the "Indian Removal policy" began to implement the act of Congress signed by <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Jackson" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> in 1830. The forced march of about twenty <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> tribes included the "Five Civilized Tribes" (<a href="/wiki/Creek_people" title="Creek people" class="mw-redirect">Creek</a>, <a href="/wiki/Choctaw" title="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cherokee" title="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, <a href="/wiki/Chickasaw" title="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Seminole" title="Seminole">Seminole</a>). They were pushed beyond the frontier and into the "Indian Territory" (which later became Oklahoma). Of the approximate 70,000 Indians removed, about 20% died from disease, starvation, and exposure on the route. This exodus has become known as <a href="/wiki/The_Trail_of_Tears" title="The Trail of Tears" class="mw-redirect">The Trail of Tears</a> (in Cherokee "Nunna dual Tsuny", "The Trail Where they Cried"). The impact of the removals was severe. Sometimes the transplanted tribes clashed with the tribes native to the area. In addition, the <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">Smallpox</a> Epidemic of 1837 decimated the tribes of the Upper Missouri, weakening them, and allowing immigrants easier access to those lands.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Indian removals were justified by two prevailing philosophies. The "superior race" theory contended that "inferior" peoples (i.e., natives) held land in trust until a "superior race" came along which would be a more productive steward of the land. Humanitarians espoused a second theory stating that the removal of natives would take them away from the contaminating influences of the frontier and help preserve their culture.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Neither theory showed any understanding of the natives' intimate connection with their land nor the deadly effect of social and physical uprooting. For example, tribes were dependent on local animals and plants for their food and their medicinal and cultural purposes, which were often unavailable after moving.</p>

<p>In 1827, the Cherokee, on the basis of earlier treaties, declared themselves a sovereign nation within the boundaries of Georgia. When the Georgia state government ignored the declaration and annexed the land, the Cherokee took their case to the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a>. The court ruled Georgia's laws null and void in the Cherokee nation, but the state ignored the ruling. The court also ruled that the tribes were "domestic dependent nations" and could not make treaties with other nations. Furthermore, it was up to the federal government to protect those rights, making the tribes, in effect, wards of the federal government. President Jackson, having just signed the Indian Removal Act, failed to enforce the court ruling, illegally abdicating to the states the right to make policy regarding the tribes.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> In effect, Jackson refused to honor the federal government's commitment to protect the southern tribes and to act in its proper role in dealing with the tribes as sovereign, though dependent, nations.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> Jackson justified his actions by stating that Indians had "neither the intelligence, the industry, the moral habits, nor the desire of improvements."<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The only way for a Native American to avoid removal was to accept the federal offer of 640&#160;acres (2.6&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) or more of land (depending on family size) in exchange for leaving the tribe and becoming a U.S. citizen subject to state law and federal law. However, many natives who took the offer were defrauded by "ravenous speculators" who stole their claims and sold their land to whites. In Mississippi alone, fraudulent claims reached 3,800,000&#160;acres (15,400&#160;km<sup>2</sup>). Some of those who refused to move or take the offer found sanctuary for a while in remote areas. To motivate natives reluctant to move, the federal government also promised rifles, blankets, tobacco, and cash. Of the five tribes, the Seminole offered the most resistance, hiding out in the <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> swamps and waging a war which cost the U.S. Army 1,500 lives and $20 million. Through war, abandonment, and the removal policy, the federal government acquired about 442,800,000&#160;acres (1,792,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) of native land in the East from 1776 to 1842.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>No sooner had the federal government created the "Indian Territory" than whites began to encroach upon the boundaries, traders began to sell prohibited liquor, and settlers took shortcuts across Indian land on their way to Oregon and California. As the migrants moved across the Great Plains, their livestock sometimes trampled or ate Indian crops. Some tribes struck back by raiding livestock and by demanding payment from settlers crossing their land. The federal government attempted to reduce tensions and create new tribal boundaries in the Great Plains with two new treaties in the early 1850s. The <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Laramie" title="Treaty of Fort Laramie">Treaty of Fort Laramie</a> established tribal zones for the <a href="/wiki/Sioux" title="Sioux">Sioux</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cheyennes" title="Cheyennes" class="mw-redirect">Cheyennes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arapahos" title="Arapahos" class="mw-redirect">Arapahos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Crows" title="Crows" class="mw-redirect">Crows</a>, and others, and allowed for the building of roads and posts across the tribal lands.

<p><a href="/wiki/Manifest_Destiny" title="Manifest Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> was the belief that the United States was pre-ordained by God to expand from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast. The concept was expressed during Colonial times, but the term was coined by newspaperman <a href="/wiki/John_L._O%27Sullivan" title="John L. O'Sullivan">John O'Sullivan</a>, and became a rallying cry for expansionists in the 1840s. It was a moral/religious as well as political/economic justification for growth, regardless of the social and legal consequences for Native Americans. Implicit is the position that the American claim supersedes―by God's favor―that of foreign nations or the native peoples. O'Sullivan wrote, "Away, away with all these cobweb tissues of rights of discovery, exploration, settlement, continuity, etc.... The American claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federative self-government entrusted to us."<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Polk and Tyler administrations successfully promoted this nationalistic doctrine over sectionalists and others who objected for moral reasons or over concerns about the spread of slavery. Starting with the annexation of Texas, the expansionists got the upper hand. To gain the acceptance of Northerners, Texas was even promoted by expansionists as a place where slavery could be concentrated, and from where blacks and slavery would eventually leave the U.S. entirely, solving the problem forever.</p>

<p>In California, the twenty-one mission settlements established by the Catholic Church had failed to attract sufficient Mexican settlers who had viewed the region as too remote. The Spanish aristocracy (the "californios") controlled the territory through vast land grants on which large cattle ranches spread.

The few Americans in the area were mostly traders, merchants, and sailors, many from "Yerba Buena" (renamed <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> in 1846).

<p>A crisis with Mexico had been brewing from the time Texas won its independence in 1836. The annexation of Texas by the United States brought feelings on both sides to a boil.

<p>On January 24, 1848, James Marshall discovered gold in the <a href="/wiki/Tailrace" title="Tailrace" class="mw-redirect">tailrace</a> of the mill he had built for <a href="/wiki/John_Sutter" title="John Sutter">John Sutter</a>. Sutter, a Swiss entrepreneur, had acquired a land grant for over 49,000&#160;acres (200&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) near present day <a href="/wiki/Sacramento" title="Sacramento" class="mw-redirect">Sacramento</a> and built himself what was, in effect, an independent principality. According to Sutter's reminiscence, "Marshall pulled out of his trousers pocket a white cotton rag which contained something rolled up in it... Opening the cloth, he held it before me in his hand... 'I believe this is gold,' said Marshall, 'but the people at the mill laughed at me and called me crazy.' I carefully examined it and said to him: 'Well, it looks like gold. Let us test it.'."<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> Prior to this discovery, gold mining in the United States had been limited to primitive mines in the Southeast, especially in Georgia. Word spread quickly across the United States, after Polk told Congress in December 1848, "The accounts of the abundance of gold in that territory are of such an extraordinary character as would scarcely command belief were they not corroborated by the authentic reports of officers in the public service."<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" title=""><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The word also reached experienced miners in South America and Europe, who quickly headed to California.

<p>As in many other boomtowns to come, rapid growth in San Francisco resulted in hastily erected housing, mob rule, vigilant justice, hyper-inflated prices, environmental degradation, and considerable squalor. Field conditions for miners were even worse. They lived in log cabins and tents, and worked in all kinds of weather, suffering disease without treatment. Supplies were expensive and food poor, subsisting mostly of pork, beans, and whiskey. A weekend's entertainment back in town with a prostitute and plentiful drink could cost hundreds of dollars, not including gambling losses, wiping out a month or more of found gold.<sup id="cite_ref-Robert_M._Utley_2003_p._193_58-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Robert_M._Utley_2003_p._193-58" title=""><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Without courts or law officers in the mining communities to enforce claims and justice, miners developed their own ad hoc legal system, based on the "mining codes" used in other mining communities abroad.

<p><a href="/wiki/Prostitution_in_the_United_States" title="Prostitution in the United States">Prostitution</a> grew rapidly in the Western boom towns, attracting many female workers from the East and Mid-West. In many towns, the ratio of "honest" women to men was 1 to 100, thereby encouraging the flesh trade. Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which "pimps" took over, and the treatment of the women generally declined. The openness of bordellos in western towns depicted in films was somewhat realistic, though the true appearance of most prostitutes was far less attractive than those depicted by Hollywood starlets. Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later―as the female population increased, reformers moved in, and other civilizing influences arrived―did prostitution become less blatant and less common.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Californian_Gold_Rush" title="Californian Gold Rush" class="mw-redirect">Gold Rush</a> radically changed the California economy and brought in an array of professionals, including precious metal specialists, merchants, doctors, and attorneys, who supplemented the numerous miners, saloonkeepers, gamblers, and prostitutes.

The extraordinary size of early finds (including nuggets of over 20&#160;lb (9.1&#160;kg). each), the surprise of the finds, and the abundance of surface gold helps explain that irrational fervor. As thousands arrived, however, fewer and fewer miners struck their fortune, and most ended exhausted and broke. Most of the California Gold Rush discoveries were achieved through placer mining, the finding of nuggets and grains loosened from rock by nature through erosion and carried down streams from the Sierras. This was relatively easier and required less capital and expertise than vein mining which required drilling down into rock and breaking gold and silver loose.<sup id="cite_ref-Howard_R._Lamar_1977_pp._446-447_62-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Howard_R._Lamar_1977_pp._446-447-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup> Over 250,000 miners found a total of more than $200 million in gold in the five years of the California Gold Rush<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" title=""><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Howard_R._Lamar_1977_pp._446-447_62-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Howard_R._Lamar_1977_pp._446-447-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p>Following the California and Nevada discoveries, miners left those areas and hunted for gold along the Rockies and in the southwest.

<p><a href="/wiki/Tombstone,_Arizona" title="Tombstone, Arizona">Tombstone, Arizona</a> was another notorious mining town.

Virgil took over as town marshal when the previous one was killed. Soon, however, the Earps were tangling with the Clantons and McLaurys, rowdy ranchers who bristled at attempts to curtail their freedom and their criminal activities. The most famous gunfight of the Old West, the <a href="/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_O.K._Corral" title="Gunfight at the O.K. Corral">Gunfight at the O.K.

Poor ventilation concentrated a toxic brew of carbon dioxide, dust, and other compounds and caused frequent headaches and dizziness. Accidents, premature explosions, and cave-ins were common and deadly. About half the miners had lung disorders, shortening their lives to an average of 43 years. In the hard rock mines, accidents annually disabled 1 of every 30 miners and killed 1 out of 80, the highest rates of any U.S. industry.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70" title=""><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The end of the Mexican War and the first migrations to California and Oregon prompted the federal government to undertake an additional series of surveys to chart the remaining unexplored regions of the West, to establish boundaries, and to plan possible routes for a transcontinental railroad.

<p>Major requirements for the rail route were an adequate supply of water and wood, surmountable geography, and a politically and economically acceptable solution.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Gold_Rush" title="Gold Rush" class="mw-redirect">Gold Rush</a> and the subsequent spurt of migration to California hastened the need for better communications across the continent. Mail was being transported to San Francisco by ship from New York, with a land crossing across the Isthmus of Panama, normally a month's trip. Then the federal government provided subsidies for the development of mail and freight delivery, and by 1856, Congress authorized road improvements and an overland mail service to California. There was even an experiment to use camels for transportation. Commercial wagon trains began to haul freight out west. For mail, the <a href="/wiki/Butterfield_Overland_Mail" title="Butterfield Overland Mail">Overland Mail Company</a> was formed, using what was called the "Butterfield route", through Texas, then New Mexico and into Arizona, over the dangerous Apache Pass protected by <a href="/wiki/Fort_Bowie" title="Fort Bowie">Fort Bowie</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74" title=""><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup> This route was abandoned by 1862, after Texas joined the confederacy, in favor of stagecoach services established via <a href="/wiki/Fort_Laramie" title="Fort Laramie" class="mw-redirect">Fort Laramie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Salt_Lake_City" title="Salt Lake City">Salt Lake City</a>, a 24 day journey, with <a href="/wiki/Wells_Fargo_%26_Co." title="Wells Fargo &amp; Co." class="mw-redirect">Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</a> as the foremost provider (initially keeping the "Butterfield" name).</p>

<p>William Russell, hoping to get a government contract for more rapid mail delivery service, started the <a href="/wiki/Pony_Express" title="Pony Express">Pony Express</a> in 1860, cutting delivery time to ten days. He set up over 150 stations about 15&#160;miles (24&#160;km) apart. Riders were required to be expert and weigh less than 125&#160;lb (57&#160;kg)., with an advertisement of the time asking for, "young skinny wiry fellows, not over eighteen... willing to risk death daily... Orphans preferred... Wages: $25 per week."

The telegraph and the <a href="/wiki/Morse_Code" title="Morse Code" class="mw-redirect">Morse Code</a> made possible the instantaneous transmission of information and the beginning the tele-communications industry.

<p>With the war over, the federal government focused on improving the governance of the territories. It subdivided several territories, preparing them for statehood, following the precedents set by the <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance" title="Northwest Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a> of 1787.<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84" title=""><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></a></sup> It also standardized procedures and the supervision of territorial governments, taking away some local powers, and imposing much "red tape", growing the federal bureaucracy significantly.<sup id="cite_ref-Richard_White_1991_p._171_85-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Richard_White_1991_p._171-85" title=""><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Federal involvement in the territories was considerable. In addition to direct subsidies, the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbor improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, and at the same time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86" title=""><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Territorial governors were political appointees and beholden to Washington so they usually governed with a light hand, allowing the legislatures to deal with the local issues. In addition to his role as civil governor, a territorial governor was also a militia commander, a local superintendent of Indian affairs, and the state liaison with federal agencies.<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87" title=""><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></a></sup> State legislators, on the other hand, spoke for the local citizens and they were given considerable leeway by the federal government to make local law, except in extreme cases, as when the Federal government squashed <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> by the Mormons in Utah.<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88" title=""><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>These improvements to governance still left plenty of room for profiteering.

<p>In acquiring, preparing, and distributing public land to private ownership, the federal government generally followed the system set forth by the <a href="/wiki/Land_Ordinance" title="Land Ordinance">Land Ordinance</a> of 1785. Federal exploration and scientific teams would undertake reconnaissance of the land and determine Native American habitation. Through treaty, land title would be ceded by the resident tribes. Then surveyors would create detailed maps marking the land into squares of six miles (10&#160;km) on each side, subdivided first into one square mile blocks, then into 160-acre (0.65&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) lots. Townships would be formed from the lots and sold at public auction. Unsold land could be purchased from the land office at a minimum price of $1.25 per acre.<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90" title=""><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In theory, the system would provide a fair distribution of land and reduce large accumulations of land by private owners. In reality, speculators could exploit loopholes and acquire large tracts of land. There was no limit to purchases of the unsold land by speculators. Furthermore, settlers often got to the land ahead of the surveyors and became squatters, living on land they held no title to.<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91" title=""><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As part of public policy, the government would award public land to certain groups such as veterans, through the use of "land script". The script traded in a financial market, often at below the $1.25 per acre minimum price set by law, which gave speculators, investors, and developers another way to acquired large tracts of land cheaply. Land policy became politicized by competing factions and interests, and the question of slavery on new lands was contentious. As a counter to land speculators, farmers formed "claims clubs" to enable them to buy larger tracts than the 160-acre (0.65&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) allotments by trading among themselves at controlled prices.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92" title=""><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The federal government also began to give away land for agricultural colleges, Indian reservations, public institutions, and the construction of railroads.

<p>In 1862, Congress passed three important bills that impacted the land system. The <a href="/wiki/Homestead_Act" title="Homestead Act">Homestead Act</a> granted 160&#160;acres (0.65&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) to each settler who improved the land for five years, to citizens and non-citizens including squatters, for no more than modest filing fees. If a six months residency was complied with, the settler then had the option to buy the parcel at $1.25 per acre. The property could then be sold or mortgaged and neighboring land acquired if expansion was desired.<sup id="cite_ref-Richard_White_1991_p._143_94-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Richard_White_1991_p._143-94" title=""><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> Though the act was on the whole successful, the 160-acre (0.65&#160;km<sup>2</sup>) size of parcels was not large enough for the needs of Western farmers and ranchers, and it failed to address the needs of the mining and timber operations as well.</p>

Homesteaders</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Early on after the <a href="/wiki/California_Gold_Rush" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, the federal government decided to leave the regulation of mining claims to local governments. This was reversed by later acts, which helped legitimate land acquisition for all purposes but which also made it easier for speculators and swindlers, especially in the timber and ranching industries. Given the necessity of water for ranching, squabbles over water rights ensued and complicated the situation<sup id="cite_ref-Richard_White_1991_p._143_94-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Richard_White_1991_p._143-94" title=""><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup>. The railroads got much of the best land and the land available to homesteaders was not always arable or commercially useful. On the whole, only about one-third of all Homestead Act claimants actually completed the process of obtaining title to their land.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95" title=""><span>[</span>96<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="/w/index.php?title=Pacific_Railroad_Grant&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pacific Railroad Grant (page does not exist)">Pacific Railroad Grant</a> provided for the land needed to build the transcontinental railroad. Since several routes were under consideration, the amount of land so provided was huge, over 174,000,000&#160;acres (700,000&#160;km<sup>2</sup>).<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96" title=""><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup> The land given the railroads alternated with government-owned tracts saved for distribution to homesteaders. In an effort to be equitable, the federal government reduced each tract to 80&#160;acres (320,000&#160;m<sup>2</sup>) because of its perceived higher value given its proximity to the rail line. Railroads had up to five years to sell or mortgage their land, after tracks were laid, after which unsold land could be purchased by anyone. Often railroads sold some of their government acquired land to homesteaders immediately to encourage settlement and the growth of markets the railroads would then be able to serve. However, the railroads were slow to build in some areas, waiting for the population to grow adequately on its own, before selecting final routes. This caused a "chicken-and-egg" situation which, in some cases, impeded rather than hastened settlement.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97" title=""><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup> Congress also made loans to the railroads based on the mileage of rail.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Morrill_Act" title="Morrill Act" class="mw-redirect">Morrill Act</a> provided land grants to states to build institutions of higher education for agricultural purposes, in an effort to stimulate rural economic growth and the education programs to support it. The states would sell the bulk of the land to raise funds to build the institutions.<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98" title=""><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The federal government even attempted to forest the prairies to make better use of undesirable land. Relying on the theory that planting trees would alter the climate enough to produce the rainfall need to sustain the forests long term, the government encouraged homesteaders to plant trees. When the "rain-follows-the-plow program" failed due to drought and pests, the federal government turned instead to more practical programs to develop irrigation, though large-scale irrigation projects came decades later.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99" title=""><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup> But by the 1870s, the large land giveaways raised concerns about the management of remaining public lands, particularly those of unique value such as the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canyon" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yellowstone" title="Yellowstone" class="mw-redirect">Yellowstone</a>, and the conservation movement was born.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Pacific_Railroad_Act" title="Pacific Railroad Act" class="mw-redirect">Pacific Railroad Act</a> of 1862 finally hastened the transition of the transcontinental railroad from dream to reality. Existing rail lines, particularly belonging to the <a href="/wiki/Union_Pacific" title="Union Pacific" class="mw-redirect">Union Pacific</a>, had already reached westward to <a href="/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, about half way across the continent. The Central Pacific, starting in <a href="/wiki/Sacramento,_California" title="Sacramento, California">Sacramento, California</a>, was extended eastward across the Sierras to link with the Union Pacific heading west. The two finally met at Promontory Point, Utah on May 10, 1869. <a href="/wiki/Leland_Stanford" title="Leland Stanford">Leland Stanford</a>, one of the prime backers of the Central Pacific, hammered the <a href="/wiki/Golden_spike" title="Golden spike">golden spike</a> in triumph, linking the two lines. A cross-country trip was reduced from about four months to one week by the completion of the railroad.<sup id="cite_ref-Robert_M._Utley_2003_p._227_101-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Robert_M._Utley_2003_p._227-101" title=""><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Building the railroad required six main activities: surveying the route, blasting a right of way, building tunnels and bridges, clearing and laying the roadbed, laying the ties and rails, and maintaining and supplying the crews with food and tools. The work was highly labor intensive, using mostly plows, scrapers, picks, axes, chisels, sledgehammers, and handcarts. A few steam-driven machines, such as shovels, were employed as well. Each iron rail weighed 700&#160;lb (320&#160;kg). and required five men to lift. For blasting, they used gunpowder, nitroglycerine, and limited amounts of dynamite. The Central Pacific employed over 12,000 Chinese workers, 90 percent of the work force. The Union Pacific employed mostly Irishmen. The crews averaged about two miles (3&#160;km) of new track per day but they were driven to do more<sup id="cite_ref-Robert_M._Utley_2003_p._227_101-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Robert_M._Utley_2003_p._227-101" title=""><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup>. Each man lifted a few tons a day of weight. In the haste to complete the project, engineering errors caused collapsing roadbeds and badly graded curves. Substandard rails and ties were also serious problems. The defects became even more apparent with freight runs, causing many accidents, and the line eventually required millions of dollars to repair and replace bad track.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102" title=""><span>[</span>103<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>With grants and loans, the federal government stimulated the land and capital acquisition needed for the project. <a href="/wiki/Leland_Stanford" title="Leland Stanford">Leland Stanford</a>, former governor and part of a group of businessmen known as the "Big Four", sold stock and bonds in the enterprise to finance construction, with the help of Wall Street money men like <a href="/wiki/Jay_Gould" title="Jay Gould">Jay Gould</a> who connected with investors in the United States and Europe. The enterprise was considered risky, given the high construction costs, and the bonds need to yield high interest (similar to today's "junk bonds") to be attractive to investors.<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103" title=""><span>[</span>104<span>]</span></a></sup> The huge dollars involved in the project and the participation of so many groups out to profit resulted in substantial corruption and influence peddling. The owners of both construction companies, using mostly "other people's money", insured their own profits with shady dealing and with slush funds used to bribe government officials.</p>
<p>The worst corruption revolved around <a href="/wiki/George_Francis_Train" title="George Francis Train">George Francis Train</a>'s <a href="/w/index.php?title=Cr%C3%A9dit_Mobilier&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Crédit Mobilier (page does not exist)">Crédit Mobilier</a>, the construction company for the Union Pacific, which, according to author Richard White, drew in "dozens of congressmen, a secretary of the treasury, two vice-presidents, a leading presidential contender, and an eventual president.

While the Central Pacific-Union Pacific railroad succeeded, other transcontinental projects failed to reach the Pacific coast until many years later. The most notorious was the Northern Pacific project which failed to sell its bonds, resulting in the collapse of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jay_Cooke_and_Company&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jay Cooke and Company (page does not exist)">Jay Cooke and Company</a> investment house and helping to trigger the financial <a href="/wiki/Panic_of_1873" title="Panic of 1873">Panic of 1873</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-105" title=""><span>[</span>106<span>]</span></a></sup> The most profitable of the transcontinental lines was the <a href="/wiki/Great_Northern" title="Great Northern">Great Northern</a> railroad which ran along the northern tier of the United States, providing freight service to the Northwest. The cost of moving freight on the Great Northern was 2.88 cents per ton early on, falling to less than .80 cents by 1907.<sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-106" title=""><span>[</span>107<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Despite the engineering problems and political scandals, the transcontinental railroad was a big success in helping to open up the West. In the first year, 150,000 passengers made the trip for "pleasure, health, or business" and enjoyed the "luxurious cars and eating houses" as advertised by the Union Pacific. Settlers were encouraged with promotions to come West on scouting trips to buy land near the line and to use the rails for freight needs. The railroads had "Immigration Bureaus" which advertised the "promised land" abroad. Railroad "Land Departments" sold land on easy terms. The <a href="/wiki/Great_Plains" title="Great Plains">Great Plains</a>, a harder "sell" than California or Oregon, was promoted as "prairie which is ready for the plow" and "a flowery meadow" only requiring "diligent labor and economy to ensure an early reward."<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-107" title=""><span>[</span>108<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The transcontinental railroad spurred the development of trunk and feeder lines and the <a href="/wiki/Railroads_in_Omaha" title="Railroads in Omaha">rapid growth of Omaha</a> specifically, creating a rail network extending from the city that eventually reached over most of the West. The railroads made possible the transformation of the United States from an agrarian society to a modern industrial nation. Not only did they bring eastern products west and agricultural products east, but they also helped the establishment of western branches of eastern companies. Mail order businesses grew rapidly, bringing city products to rural families, sometimes dominating local companies and forcing them out of business. The building and the operation of railroads, which required vast amounts of coal and lumber, spurred the timber and mining industries. Most industries benefited from the lower costs of transportation and the expanding markets made possible by the railroads. Railroads also had a profound social effect. Rail travel brought immigrant families to the West as women were less intimidated by the rail journey west than by wagon. The greater numbers of women and children migrating west helped stabilize and tame some of the wild frontier towns, as these settlers organized and demanded schools, law enforcement, churches, and other institutions supportive of family life<sup id="cite_ref-Robert_M._Utley_2003_p._231_67-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Robert_M._Utley_2003_p._231-67" title=""><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p>After the Civil War, many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising "the Best Prairie Lands", "Low Prices", "Large Discounts For Cash", and "Better Terms Than Ever!". The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special "land exploring tickets", the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads.<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108" title=""><span>[</span>109<span>]</span></a></sup> Some migrants went west reluctantly, particularly women tied to their husbands economically, who viewed the dangers of the West more objectively.

<p>Most migrants, however, put those concerns aside. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger and more fertile areas; merchants and tradesman new customers and less competitive markets; laborers higher paying work and better conditions. The major exception was the <a href="/wiki/Mormons" title="Mormons" class="mw-redirect">Mormons</a>, who sought a religious and economic <a href="/wiki/Utopia" title="Utopia">Utopia</a>, free of persecution, which would allow their entire community to thrive.<sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-111" title=""><span>[</span>112<span>]</span></a></sup> In many cases, migrants sank their roots in communities of similar religious and ethnic backgrounds.

<p>The rise of the cattle industry and the cowboy is directly tied to the demise of the huge <a href="/wiki/Bison" title="Bison">bison</a> herds of the Great Plains. Once numbering over 25 million, bison were a vital resource animal for the Plains Indians, providing food, hides for clothing and shelter, and bones for implements. Drought, loss of habitat, disease, and over-hunting steadily reduced the herds through the 19th century to the point of near extinction. Overland trails and growing settlements began to block the free movement of the herds to feeding and breeding areas. Initially, commercial hunters sought bison to make "<a href="/wiki/Pemmican" title="Pemmican">pemmican</a>," a mixture of pounded buffalo meat, fat, and berries, which was a long-lasting food used by trappers and other outdoorsmen. Not only did white hunters impact the herds, but Indians who arrived from the East also contributed to their reduction. Adding to the kill was the wanton slaughter of bison by sportsmen, migrants, and soldiers. Shooting bison from passing trains was common sport. However, the greatest negative effect on the herds was the huge markets opened up by the completion of the transcontinental railroad. Hides in great quantities were tanned into leather and fashioned into clothing and furniture. Killing far exceeded market requirements, reaching over one million per year. As much as five bison were killed for each one that reached market, and most of the meat was left to rot on the plains and at trackside after removal of the hides. Skulls were often ground for fertilizer. A skilled hunter could kill over 100 bison in a day.<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116" title=""><span>[</span>117<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>By the 1870s, the great slaughter of bison had a major impact on the Plains Indians, dependent on the animal both economically and spiritually. Soldiers of the U.S. Army deliberately encouraged and abetted the killing of bison as part of the campaigns against the Sioux and Pawnee, in an effort to deprive them of their resource animal and to demoralize them.<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117" title=""><span>[</span>118<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The sharp decline of the herds of the Plains created a vacuum which was exploited by the growing cattle industry. Spanish cattlemen had introduced cattle ranching and longhorn cattle to the Southwest in the 17th century, and the men who worked the ranches, called "vaqueros", were the first "cowboys" in the West. After the Civil War―with railheads available at Abilene, Kansas City, Dodge City, and Wichita―Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle and drove them north along the Western, Chisholm, and Shawnee trails. The cattle were slaughtered in Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. The <a href="/wiki/Chisholm_Trail" title="Chisholm Trail">Chisholm Trail</a>, laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm, was the major artery of cattle commerce, carrying over 1.5 million head of cattle between 1867 and 1871 over the 800&#160;miles (1,300&#160;km) from south Texas to <a href="/wiki/Abilene,_Kansas" title="Abilene, Kansas">Abilene, Kansas</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118" title=""><span>[</span>119<span>]</span></a></sup> The long drives were treacherous, especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the <a href="/wiki/Red_River" title="Red River">Red River</a> and when they had to fend off Indians and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle. A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles (3&#160;km) of cattle six abreast.<sup id="cite_ref-Howard_R._Lamar_1977_p._269_119-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Howard_R._Lamar_1977_p._269-119" title=""><span>[</span>120<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite the risks, the long Texas drives proved very profitable and attracted investors from the United States and abroad. The price of one head of cattle raised in Texas was about $4 but was worth more than $40 back East.<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120" title=""><span>[</span>121<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By the 1870s and 1880's, cattle ranches expanded further north into new grazing grounds and replaced the bison herds in Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Nebraska and the Dakota territory, using the rails to ship to both coasts. Many of the largest ranches were owned by Scottish and British financiers. The single largest cattle ranch in the entire West was owned by American John W. Iliff, "cattle king of the Plains", operating in Colorado and Wyoming.<sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121" title=""><span>[</span>122<span>]</span></a></sup> Gradually, longhorns were replaced by the American breeds of Hereford and Angus, introduced by settlers from the Northwest. Though less hardy and more disease-prone, these breeds produced better tasting beef and matured faster.<sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122" title=""><span>[</span>123<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123" title=""><span>[</span>124<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the late 1880s, disaster struck the cattle industry. Overgrazing, harsh weather, and competition from sheep ranches led to a sharp price drop as ranchers gave up on cattle and sold their herds into a falling market. Sheep grazing took over as sheep were easier to feed and needed less water. However, sheep also helped cause ecological changes that enabled foreign grasses to invade the Plains and also caused increased erosion. Open range cattle ranching came to an end and was replaced by barbed wire spreads where water, breeding, feeding, and grazing could be controlled. This led to "fence wars" which erupted over disputes about water rights. Cattlemen and sheep ranchers sometimes engaged in violence against each other as did large and small cattle ranchers, culminating in the <a href="/wiki/Johnson_County_War" title="Johnson County War">Johnson County War</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124" title=""><span>[</span>125<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Anchoring the booming cattle industry of the 1860s and 1870's were the cattle towns in Kansas and Missouri. Like the mining towns in California and Nevada, cattle towns such as <a href="/wiki/Abilene,_Kansas" title="Abilene, Kansas">Abilene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dodge_City" title="Dodge City" class="mw-redirect">Dodge City</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ellsworth" title="Ellsworth">Ellsworth</a> experienced a short period of boom and bust lasting about five years. The cattle towns would spring up as land speculators would rush in ahead of a proposed rail line and build a town and the supporting services attractive to the cattlemen and the cowboys. If the railroads complied, the new grazing ground and supporting town would secure the cattle trade. However, unlike the mining towns which in many cases became <a href="/wiki/Ghost_town" title="Ghost town">ghost towns</a> and ceased to exist after the ore played out, cattle towns often evolved from cattle to farming and continued on after the grazing lands were exhausted. In some cases, resistance by moral reformers and alliances of businessmen drove the cattle trade out of town. Ellsworth, on the other hand, floundered as the result of Indian raids, floods, and <a href="/wiki/Cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125" title=""><span>[</span>126<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The early years of male-dominated life in cattle towns gave way to a more balanced community of farm families and small businesses as the boom passed. Though lawlessness, prostitution, and gambling were significant in cattle towns, especially early on, the greed factor in the mining towns added an extra element of danger and violence. Since these towns grew rapidly, law and order often took a while to establish itself. Vigilante justice did occur, but in many cases, it subsided when adequate police forces were appointed. While some vigilante committees served the public good fairly and successfully in the absence of law officers and judges, more often than not vigilantism was motivated by bigotry and base emotion and produced imperfect justice directed at those considered socially inferior.<sup id="cite_ref-Richard_White_1991_p._330_126-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Richard_White_1991_p._330-126" title=""><span>[</span>127<span>]</span></a></sup> Indian hunting and race riots against the Chinese were severe manifestations of vigilantism.<sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127" title=""><span>[</span>128<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A contemporary eyewitness of Hays City, Kansas paints a vivid image of a cattle town:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hays City by lamplight was remarkably lively, but not very moral. The streets blazed with a reflection from saloons, and a glance within showed floors crowded with dancers, the gaily dressed women striving to hide with ribbons and paint the terrible lines which that grim artist, Dissipation, loves to draw upon such faces... To the music of violins and the stamping of feet the dance went on, and we saw in the giddy maze old men who must have been pirouetting on the very edge of their graves."<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128" title=""><span>[</span>129<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To control violence, sometimes cowboys were segregated into brothel districts away from the main part of town. <a href="/wiki/Cattle_rustling" title="Cattle rustling" class="mw-redirect">Cattle rustling</a> was a serious offense sometimes punished by lynching. However, free-shooting brawls, also known as "hurrahing", were not as frequent as in the movies. In Wichita, handguns were outlawed within city limits and in many towns some form of gun control existed. Also unlike in the movies, marshals rarely shot outlaws, especially in the middle of Main Street in a showdown. Famed lawmen such as <a href="/wiki/Wyatt_Earp" title="Wyatt Earp">Wyatt Earp</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bat_Masterson" title="Bat Masterson">Bat Masterson</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Wild_Bill_Hickok" title="Wild Bill Hickok">Wild Bill Hickok</a>, and less remembered ones like <a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Meagher&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Michael Meagher (page does not exist)">Michael Meagher</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Thomas_James_Smith&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Thomas James Smith (page does not exist)">Thomas James Smith</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Bill_Tilghman" title="Bill Tilghman">Bill Tilghman</a> actually averaged only one or two killings in a year.<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129" title=""><span>[</span>130<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In reality, the main activity of law enforcement in cattle towns was knocking down drunks and hauling them away before they hurt themselves or others, somewhat akin to naval military police controlling shore leave. They also disarmed cowboys who violated gun control edicts, tried to prevent dueling, and dealt with flagrant breaches of gambling and prostitution ordinances.<sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-130" title=""><span>[</span>131<span>]</span></a></sup> When the cattle were not in town, Wyatt Earp and other lawmen might be heading up street repair projects or doing other civic chores, or tending to their own business interests<sup id="cite_ref-Richard_White_1991_p._330_126-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Richard_White_1991_p._330-126" title=""><span>[</span>127<span>]</span></a></sup>. Usually, justices of the peace were poorly schooled in law, politically corrupt, and depended on assessing fees and fines to make a living. The better ones ruled by common sense and experience, but could be inconsistent as they did not resort to statutes to guide their rulings. Only federal judges tended to be the highest quality and followed written law. Honest jurors were hard to find and most jurors were biased by their personal relationships and acquaintances.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-131" title=""><span>[</span>132<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Much of the banditry of the West was carried out by Mexicans and Indians against Anglo-American targets of opportunity along the U.S.&#160;– Mexico border, particularly in Texas, Arizona, and California. <a href="/wiki/Pancho_Villa" title="Pancho Villa" class="mw-redirect">Pancho Villa</a>, after leaving his father's employ, took up the life of banditry in <a href="/wiki/Durango" title="Durango">Durango</a> and later in the state of <a href="/wiki/Chihuahua_(state)" title="Chihuahua (state)">Chihuahua</a>.

<p>Central to the myth and the reality of the West is the American <a href="/wiki/Cowboy" title="Cowboy">cowboy</a>. His real life was a hard one and revolved around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. On a long drive, there was usually one cowboy for each 250 head of cattle<sup id="cite_ref-Howard_R._Lamar_1977_p._269_119-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Howard_R._Lamar_1977_p._269-119" title=""><span>[</span>120<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p>Before a drive, a cowboy's duties included riding out on the range and bringing together the scattered cattle. The best cattle would be selected, roped, and branded, and most male cattle were castrated. The cattle also needed to be dehorned and examined and treated for infections. On the long drives, the cowboys had to keep the cattle moving and in line. The cattle had to be watched day and night as they were prone to stampedes and straying. The work days often lasted fourteen hours, with just six hours of sleep. It was grueling, dusty work, with just a few minutes of relaxation before and at the end of a long day. On the trail, drinking, gambling, brawling, and even cursing was often prohibited and fined. It was often monotonous and boring work. Food was barely adequate and consisted mostly of bacon, beans, bread, coffee, dried fruit, and potatoes. On average, cowboys earned $30 to $40 per month. Because of the heavy physical and emotional toll, it was unusual for a cowboy to spend more than seven years on the range.<sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134" title=""><span>[</span>135<span>]</span></a></sup> As open range ranching and the long drives gave way to fenced in ranches in the 1880s, the glory days of the cowboy came to an end, and the myths about the "free living" cowboy began to emerge.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-135" title=""><span>[</span>136<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Many of the cowboys were veterans of the Civil War, particularly from the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>, who returned to ruined home towns and found no future, so they went west looking for opportunities. Some were Blacks, Hispanics, and even Native Americans, Britons, and Scotsmen. Nearly all were in their twenties or teens. The earliest cowboys in Texas learned their trade, adapted their clothing, and took their jargon from the Mexican vaqueros or "buckaroos", the heirs of Spanish cattlemen from <a href="/wiki/Andalusia" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> in Spain. Chaps, the heavy protective leather trousers worn by cowboys, got their name from the Spanish "chaparreras", and the rope was derived from "la reata". All the distinct clothing of the cowboy—boots, saddles, hats, pants, chaps, slickers, bandannas, gloves, and collar-less shirts—were practical and adaptable, designed for protection and comfort. The most enduring fashion adapted from the cowboy, popular nearly worldwide today, are "blue jeans", originally made by <a href="/wiki/Levi_Strauss" title="Levi Strauss">Levi Strauss</a> for miners in 1850.<sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-136" title=""><span>[</span>137<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

It exists on both the amateur and professional level, and it remains a favorite form of entertainment in many towns of the West.

<p>As the frontier moved westward, the establishment of U. S. military forts moved with it, representing and maintaining federal sovereignty over new territories. The military garrisons usually lacked defensible walls but were seldom attacked. They served as bases for troops at or near strategic areas, particularly for counteracting the Indian presence. For example, <a href="/wiki/Fort_Bowie" title="Fort Bowie">Fort Bowie</a> protected <a href="/wiki/Apache_Pass" title="Apache Pass">Apache Pass</a> in southern Arizona along the mail route between Tucson and El Paso and was used to launch attacks against <a href="/wiki/Cochise" title="Cochise">Cochise</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geronimo" title="Geronimo">Geronimo</a>. <a href="/wiki/Fort_Laramie" title="Fort Laramie" class="mw-redirect">Fort Laramie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fort_Kearny" title="Fort Kearny">Fort Kearny</a> helped protect immigrants crossing the Great Plains and a series of posts in California protected miners.

A witness wrote, "The horsemen had the best of it from the start.

After initial hostilities, the sheriff of Johnson County raised a posse of 200 men and set out for the ruffians' location. The posse led by the sheriff besieged the invading force at the TA Ranch on <a href="/wiki/Crazy_Woman_Creek" title="Crazy Woman Creek">Crazy Woman Creek</a>.

Millions of copies and thousands of titles were sold. The novels relied on a series of predictable literary formulas appealing to mass tastes and were often written in as little as a few days.

<p>Williams refused to help police investigate his gang, and was implicated in attacks on guards and other women, as well as multiple escape plots.

Although he continued to refuse to assist police in their gang investigations and never admitted the crimes he was convicted for, he renounced his gang affiliation and apologized for his role in founding the Crips.

<p>Williams met <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Washington" title="Raymond Washington">Raymond Washington</a> in 1971 who was from the east side of South Central, while Williams was from the west side of South Central, to form an alliance known first as the "Cribs" later to be pronounced "Crips". (Ray Washington was killed in August 1979, his funeral took place on his birthday).The purpose for creating the gang initially was to eliminate all street gangs and create a "bull-force" neighborhood watch. Williams said "we started out — at least my intent was to, in a sense — address all of the so-called neighboring gangs in the area and to put, in a sense — I thought I can cleanse the neighborhood of all these, you know, marauding gangs. But I was totally wrong. And eventually, we morphed into the monster we were addressing."<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/30/153247" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/30/153247" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>

<p>In 1979 Williams was convicted of four robbery/murders, in two separate incidents. Williams always maintained his innocence, though subsequent court reviews concluded that there was no compelling reason to grant a retrial.</p>
<p>Court transcripts state that Williams met with a man who is only identified in court documents as "Darryl" late on Tuesday evening, <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1979-02-28"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="02-28"><a href="/wiki/February_28" title="February 28">February 28</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1979" title="1979">1979</a></span>.<a href="http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Williams introduced Darryl to a friend of his, Alfred Coward, a.k.a. "Blackie," a reference to his dark colored skin.</p>
<p>A short time after the initial meeting, Darryl, driving a brown station wagon and accompanied by Williams, drove to the home of James Garret. Coward followed the two in his 1969 Cadillac. Williams frequently stayed with Garret, and kept some of his personal effects at that location including a 12-gauge <a href="/wiki/Shotgun" title="Shotgun">shotgun</a>. Williams went into the Garret residence, and in about ten minutes returned with the shotgun.</p>
<p>The three men then went to the home of Tony Sims in <a href="/wiki/Pomona,_California" title="Pomona, California">Pomona, California</a>, where they discussed where they could go to make some money. Afterward, they went to another residence, where Williams left the others for a period of time. Upon returning, Williams had a .22 caliber pistol, which he placed in the station wagon. Williams then suggested that they should all go to Pomona. Darryl and Williams got into the station wagon, Coward and Sims got into the Cadillac, and shortly thereafter they were on the freeway headed toward Pomona.</p>

<p>Both vehicles exited the freeway in the vicinity of <a href="/wiki/California_State_Route_72" title="California State Route 72">Whittier Boulevard</a>, where they drove to a nearby <a href="/wiki/7-Eleven" title="7-Eleven">7-Eleven</a>. Darryl and Sims, at the request of Williams, entered the store with the apparent intention of robbing it. Darryl was carrying the .22 pistol that Williams had deposited in the station wagon earlier. Darryl also had an <a href="/wiki/AK-47" title="AK-47">AK-47</a> <a href="/wiki/Assault_rifle" title="Assault rifle">assault rifle</a> in the trunk of the car, along with two <a href="/wiki/Intratec_TEC-DC9" title="Intratec TEC-DC9">Tec-9</a> <a href="/wiki/Submachine_guns" title="Submachine guns" class="mw-redirect">submachine guns</a>.</p>
<p>Seferhan, the clerk on duty at the 7-Eleven at the time, testified that he was just finishing up mopping the floor, and noticed a station wagon, along with four black men standing outside the door of the store. Sims testified that he and Darryl entered the market, after which Sims walked to the back of the store while Darryl approached Garcia and asked for a cigarette. Garcia provided and lit one for him. Sims then "walked back from the back ‘cause there was somebody in there and just walked out the door and got back in the car with Blackie. And then we left."</p>
<p>Williams and fellow gang member Coward reportedly became very unhappy that Darryl and Sims did not follow through on the plan. He then told the men that they would find another place to rob.</p>

<p>Transcripts show that next Coward and Sims followed Williams and Darryl to the 7-Eleven market located at 10437 Whittier Boulevard, in <a href="/wiki/Whittier,_California" title="Whittier, California">Whittier, California</a>. The store clerk, twenty-six year old Albert Lewis Owens, was sweeping the store at seven forty two in the parking lot. When Darryl and Sims entered the 7-Eleven, Owens put the broom and dustpan he was using on the hood of his car and followed them into the store. Williams and Coward then followed Owens into the store. Court records show that as Darryl and Sims walked to the counter area to take money from the register, Williams walked behind Owens, pulled the <a href="/wiki/Sawn-off_shotgun" title="Sawn-off shotgun" class="mw-redirect">sawn-off shotgun</a> from under his jacket and told Owens to "shut up and keep walking."

<p>While pointing the shotgun at Owens’ back, Williams directed him to a back storage room and ordered him to lie down. Coward said that he next heard the sound of a round being chambered into the shotgun. He then heard a shot and glass breaking, followed by two more shots. Records show that he shot out a security monitor and then killed Owens, shooting him twice in the back at <a href="/wiki/Point_blank_range" title="Point blank range" class="mw-redirect">point blank range</a> as he lay prone on the storage room floor.</p>
<p>Coward and Sims then fled in the two cars and returned home to Los Angeles.They had netted approximately $180 in the robbery. Once back in Los Angeles, Sims asked Williams why he had shot Owens. Williams said that he "didn’t want to leave any witnesses." Williams also said he killed Owens "because he was white and he was killing all white people." Coward testified that Williams had bragged to gang members Kevin Johnson, Mitchell Klein, and Jared Beeche about the shooting, stating, "You should have heard the way he sounded when I shot him. It was hilarious," as he made gurgling or growling noises and laughed about Owens’ death.</p>

<p>The Yang family, husband seventy-six year old Yen-Yi Yang, and wife sixty-three year old Tsai-Shai C. Yang, were immigrants from <a href="/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. They ran the Brookhaven Motel located at 10411 South Vermont Avenue in <a href="/wiki/South_Los_Angeles" title="South Los Angeles">South Central Los Angeles</a> along with their forty-three year old daughter, Yu-Chin Yang Lin, and son Robert. Yu-Chin had recently joined them from Taiwan.</p>
<p>According to court transcripts, at approximately 5:00 a.m. on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1979-03-11"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="03-11"><a href="/wiki/March_11" title="March 11">March 11</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1979" title="1979">1979</a></span>, Stanley Williams entered the Brookhaven Motel lobby and then broke down the door that led to the private office. Inside the office, Williams shot and killed Yen-Yi, Tsai-Shai, and Yu-Chin, after which he emptied the cash register and fled the scene.</p>
<p>Robert, asleep with his wife in their bedroom at the motel, was awakened by the sound of somebody breaking down the door to the motel’s office. Shortly thereafter he heard a female scream, followed by gunshots. Robert entered the motel office and found that his mother, his sister, and his father had all been shot; the cash register was empty. It was later determined that the Brookhaven incident netted Stanley Williams approximately one hundred and twenty dollars.</p>
<p>The forensic pathologist testified that Yen-Yi Yang suffered two close range shotgun wounds, one to his left arm and abdomen, and one to the lower left chest. Tsai-Shai also received two close range wounds, one to the tailbone, and the other to the front of the abdomen, entering at the navel. Yu-Chin Lin was shot once in the upper left face area at a distance of a few feet.</p>
<p>Witnesses testified that Williams referred to the victims in conversations with friends as "Buddha-heads", a <a href="/wiki/List_of_ethnic_slurs" title="List of ethnic slurs">derogatory term</a> for <a href="/wiki/Asians" title="Asians" class="mw-redirect">Asians</a>.</p>

<p>Stanley Williams was convicted in 1979 of all four murders with special circumstances on each count of felony murder (robbery) as well as multiple murder in the case of the Brookhaven event. The jury also convicted him of robbery in both cases, and found that he personally used a firearm in the commission of the crimes. The jury recommended the death penalty, and the judge accepted the recommendation and sentenced him to death.<a href="http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/44C3d1127.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/44C3d1127.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>From the beginning of his sentence, Williams maintained his innocence regarding the four murders, alleging prosecutorial misconduct, exclusion of exculpatory evidence, ineffective assistance of counsel, biased jury selection, and the misuse of jailhouse and government informants.<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/30/153247" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/30/153247" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Williams claimed that the police found "not a shred of tangible evidence, no fingerprints, no crime scenes of bloody boot prints. They didn't match my boots, nor eyewitnesses. Even the shotgun shells found conveniently at each crime scene didn't match the shotgun shells that I owned." However, the prosecution's firearms expert, a sheriff's deputy, testified during trial that the shotgun shell recovered from the Yang murder crime scene matched test shells from the shotgun owned by Stanley Williams. No second examiner verified or falsified his findings. The Defense claims this expert's methodology was "junk science at best."<a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:qVutGrYelXYJ:www.cm-p.com/pdf/executiveclemency_reply.pdf+tookie++firearms+expert+testimony&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:qVutGrYelXYJ:www.cm-p.com/pdf/executiveclemency_reply.pdf+tookie++firearms+expert+testimony&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Williams' gun was found in the home of a couple with whom he occasionally stayed. According to the District Attorney, the husband was undergoing sentencing for receiving stolen property and tried for extortion. Williams' lawyers have claimed that the District Attorney quashed a murder investigation in exchange for their testimony. The two shells recovered from the Owens crime scene were consistent with shells fired from this gun, with no exclusionary markings. The shell recovered from the Yang crime scene was conclusively matched to Williams' weapon "to the exclusion of all other firearms."<a href="http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>Critics claim that although he renounced gangs and apologized for his role in co-founding the Crips, Williams continued to associate with Crips members in prison. However, when contacted about Williams' alleged ongoing gang activity, <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department" title="Los Angeles Police Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a> spokeswoman April Harding said there was no evidence of his gang leadership. Opponents also pointed out that he received a significant amount of money from outside sources. They stated that people who appreciate Williams' work sent him money. "It's as simple as that," said Williams' spokeswoman <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Becnel" title="Barbara Becnel">Barbara Becnel</a>.<a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20051116-1659-ca-williamsexecution.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20051116-1659-ca-williamsexecution.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>The prosecution removed three blacks from serving as jurors in Williams' trial. Williams' lawyers claimed that he was convicted by a jury that had no blacks, one Latino, one Filipino-American, and ten caucasians.<a href="http://www.tookie.com/tookie_fact_sheet_10.18.05.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tookie.com/tookie_fact_sheet_10.18.05.pdf" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> The District Attorney provided proof, however, in the form of a death certificate and the sworn affidavit of another juror, that juror #12, William James McLurkin, was black.<a href="http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://da.co.la.ca.us/pdf/swilliams.pdf" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The defense responded that, contrary to the sworn affidavit, McLurkin did not appear black. They maintain that the trial record indicates that none of the lawyers -- and particularly the prosecutor -- thought Mr. McLurkin was black. McLurkin's driver license photo and the fact that both he and his mother were born in the Philippines was presented as additional evidence in a November 2005 petition for <a href="/wiki/Clemency" title="Clemency" class="mw-redirect">clemency</a>. The defense, however, has neither stated whether or not his mother was actually Filipino, nor refuted the evidence that McLurkin was black.<a href="http://www.cm-p.com/pdf/executiveclemency_reply.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cm-p.com/pdf/executiveclemency_reply.pdf" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>
<p>According to the clemency petition, in his closing arguments, prosecuting District Attorney Robert Martin described Williams as a "Bengal tiger in captivity in a zoo" and said that the jury needed to imagine him in his natural "habitat" which was like "going into the back country, into the hinterlands." In a radio interview, Martin stated that the analogy was not meant to be racial, and instead was a <a href="/wiki/Metaphor" title="Metaphor">metaphor</a> to the fact that Williams appeared in court dressed in business attire much like an animal in a zoo appears more docile than it would be in the wild.<a href="http://secure.eonstreams.com/kfi_am/jk5p120905.mp3" class="external autonumber" title="http://secure.eonstreams.com/kfi_am/jk5p120905.mp3" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<p>According to Williams' defense attorneys, in two subsequent cases, District Attorney Robert Martin was censured by the California State Supreme Court for using race as a criterion in jury selection and had two murder convictions overturned on those grounds.<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/gasper10122005.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.counterpunch.org/gasper10122005.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>

The trial record shows that after the jurors returned their guilty verdicts, Williams said, 'Sons of bitches,' in a voice sufficiently loud that the court reporter included this statement in the trial transcript." "On the day that the jury began its penalty-phase deliberations, an alternate juror reported to the bailiff that he was going to get all of them."</p>

In an effort to stop the attack, the guard blew his whistle and drew his weapon. Williams, however, continued to fight. Only after a guard fired a warning shot did Williams stop fighting. (P.

<p>In late 2005, a campaign began to urge Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to grant <a href="/wiki/Clemency" title="Clemency" class="mw-redirect">clemency</a> for Williams in consideration of his work as an anti-gang activist and asserted "redemption." Thousands of people signed online petitions calling for Schwarzenegger to commute the death sentence.

In early November, 2005, Williams' attorneys filed his formal petition for executive clemency, as well as a motion to obtain new evidence. (See <a href="#Legal_documents_.28.2A.pdf.29" title="">below</a> for the full text of the documents filed in these proceedings.)</p>
<p>The state, through the office of the <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_District_Attorney" title="Los Angeles County District Attorney">Los Angeles County District Attorney</a>, opposed the clemency petition.

In his denial, Governor Schwarzenegger cited the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The possible irregularities in Williams’ trial have been thoroughly and carefully reviewed by the courts, and there is no reason to disturb the judicial decisions that uphold the jury’s decisions that he is guilty of these four murders and should pay with his life."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The basis of his request for clemency is the "personal redemption Stanley Williams has experienced and the positive impact of the message he sends," yet "it is impossible to separate Williams' claim of innocence from his claim of redemption."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Cumulatively, the evidence demonstrating Williams is guilty of these murders is to question the efficacy of Williams' message."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"The dedication of Williams' book <i>Life in Prison</i> casts significant doubt on his personal redemption and… the mix of individuals on [the dedication] list is curious" … "the inclusion of <a href="/wiki/George_Jackson_(Black_Panther)" title="George Jackson (Black Panther)">George Jackson</a> on the list defies reason and is a significant indicator that Williams is not reformed."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Is Williams’ redemption complete and sincere, or is it just a hollow promise? Stanley Williams insists he is innocent, and that he will not and should not apologize or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case. Without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings there can be no redemption. In this case, the one thing that would be the clearest indication of complete remorse and full redemption is the one thing Williams will not do."</li>
</ul>
<p>Governor Schwarzenegger summarized by basing his denial of clemency on the "totality of circumstances."

<blockquote>
<p>"My lack of fear of this barbaric methodology of death, I rely upon my faith. It has nothing to do with machismo, with manhood, or with some pseudo former gang street code. This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—-is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Witnesses described the mood in the execution chamber as somber, and Williams showed no resistance as he was led into the execution chamber. After Williams was strapped to the gurney, he struggled against the straps holding him down to look up at the press gallery behind him, and to exchange glances with his supporters.</p>
<p>Williams's advocate and editor Barbara Becnel was also a witness to Williams's execution. In the epilogue of Williams's reprinted memoir, <i>Blue Rage, Black Redemption</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Becnel reported that prior to Williams's arrival in the death chamber, he had promised her that "he would find a way to lift his head and smile at me at some point during his execution, no matter what was being done to him. And that is exactly what he did."</p>
<p>Williams then rested his head on the gurney while medical technicians began inserting needles in his veins, although <a href="/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a> reported the staff had difficulty inserting the needles and the usually-short process took almost 20 minutes.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/13/williams.execution/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/12/13/williams.execution/" rel="nofollow">[36]</a></p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Contra_Costa_Times" title="Contra Costa Times">Contra Costa Times</a></i> reporter John Simerman added, "They had some trouble with the second I.V., which was in the left arm… Williams, at one point, grimaced or looked almost out of frustration…at the difficulty there…He had his glasses on the whole time. He kept them on, and he kept looking…"</p>
<p>With a look of frustration on his face, Williams angrily asked the technicians, "You guys doing that right?" A female guard whispered to him, and a second guard patted Williams' shoulder as if to comfort him. Williams shed one silent tear<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> but otherwise showed no emotion as he died. Members of Albert Owens' family who witnessed the execution were described as stony-faced; moreover, Lora Owens appeared very upset, according to <a href="/wiki/MSNBC" title="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> anchor <a href="/wiki/Rita_Cosby" title="Rita Cosby">Rita Cosby</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is the sixth one I have seen here at San Quentin, and I have to say this was very different. The most notable thing was that Williams had supporters at the back of the room… Ms. Becnel was among them, I understand. We could see them, and throughout the last part of the execution—or preparing him when he was still conscious, they gave what looked like <a href="/wiki/Black_power" title="Black power" class="mw-redirect">black power</a> salutes several times to him, one man and two women. And most strikingly at the end of the execution, as those three were heading out, they yelled, 'The State of California just killed an <a href="/wiki/Innocence" title="Innocence">innocent</a> man!' which is the first time I ever heard any outburst in the death chamber there."</p>

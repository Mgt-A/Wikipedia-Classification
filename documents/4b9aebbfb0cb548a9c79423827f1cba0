			<p><b>Project Blue Book</b> was one of a series of systematic studies of <a href="/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" title="Unidentified flying object">Unidentified flying objects</a> (UFOs) conducted by the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> (U.S.A.F.). Started in 1952, it was the second revival of such a study. A termination order was given for the study in December 1969, and all activity under its auspices ceased in January 1970.</p>
<p>Project Blue Book had two goals:<br /></p>
<ol>
<li>to determine if UFOs were a threat to <a href="/wiki/National_security" title="National security">national security</a>, and</li>
<li>to <a href="/wiki/Scientific_method" title="Scientific method">scientifically analyze</a> UFO-related <a href="/wiki/Data" title="Data">data</a>.<br /></li>
</ol>
<p>Thousands of UFO reports were collected, analyzed and filed. As the result of the <a href="/wiki/Condon_Report" title="Condon Report" class="mw-redirect">Condon Report</a>, which concluded there was nothing anomalous about any UFOs, Project Blue Book was ordered shut down in December 1969. This project was the last publicly known UFO research project led by the USAF.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By the time Project Blue Book ended, it had collected 12,618 UFO reports, and concluded that most of them were misidentifications of natural <a href="/wiki/Phenomena" title="Phenomena" class="mw-redirect">phenomena</a> (clouds, <a href="/wiki/Star" title="Star">stars</a>, et cetera) or conventional aircraft. A few were considered <a href="/wiki/Hoax" title="Hoax">hoaxes</a>. 701 of the reports — about six percent — were classified as unknowns, defying detailed analysis.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The UFO reports were archived and are available under the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_information_legislation" title="Freedom of information legislation">Freedom of Information Act</a>, but names and other personal information of all witnesses have been redacted.</p>
<p>Though many accepted Blue Book's final conclusions that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs, critics — then and now — have charged that Blue Book, especially in its later years, was engaging in dubious research, or even perpetuating a <a href="/wiki/Cover_up" title="Cover up" class="mw-redirect">cover up</a> of UFO evidence. Some evidence suggests that not only did some UFO reports bypass Blue Book entirely, but that the U.S. Air Force continued collecting and studying UFO reports after Blue Book had been discontinued, despite official claims to the contrary.<sup id="cite_ref-Randles179_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Randles179-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Public USAF UFO studies were first initiated under <a href="/wiki/Project_Sign" title="Project Sign">Project Sign</a> at the end of 1947, following many widely publicized UFO reports (see <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Arnold" title="Kenneth Arnold">Kenneth Arnold</a>). Project Sign was initiated specifically at the request of General <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Twining" title="Nathan Twining" class="mw-redirect">Nathan Twining</a>, chief of the <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_Materiel_Command" title="Air Force Materiel Command">Air Force Materiel Command</a> at <a href="/wiki/Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base" title="Wright-Patterson Air Force Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a>. Wright-Patterson was also to be the home of Project Sign and all subsequent official USAF public investigations.</p>
<p>Sign was officially inconclusive regarding the cause of the sightings. However, according to U.S Air Force Captain <a href="/wiki/Edward_J._Ruppelt" title="Edward J. Ruppelt">Edward J. Ruppelt</a> (the first director of Project Blue Book), Sign's initial intelligence estimate (the so-called <a href="/wiki/Estimate_of_the_Situation" title="Estimate of the Situation">Estimate of the Situation</a>) written in the late summer of 1948, concluded that the flying saucers were real craft, were not made by either the Russians or U.S., and were likely <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">extraterrestrial</a> in origin. (See also <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_hypothesis" title="Extraterrestrial hypothesis">extraterrestrial hypothesis</a>.) This estimate was forwarded to the Pentagon, but subsequently ordered destroyed by Gen. <a href="/wiki/Hoyt_Vandenberg" title="Hoyt Vandenberg">Hoyt Vandenberg</a>, USAF Chief of Staff, citing a lack of physical proof. Vandenberg subsequently dismantled Project Sign.</p>
<p>Project Sign was succeeded at the end of 1948 by <a href="/wiki/Project_Grudge" title="Project Grudge">Project Grudge</a>, which had a <a href="/wiki/Debunker" title="Debunker">debunking</a> mandate. Ruppelt referred to the era of Project Grudge as the "dark ages" of early USAF UFO investigation. Grudge concluded that all UFOs were natural phenomena or other misinterpretations, although it also stated that 23 percent of the reports could not be explained.</p>

<p>According to Captain <a href="/wiki/Edward_J._Ruppelt" title="Edward J. Ruppelt">Edward J. Ruppelt</a>, by the end of 1951, several high-ranking, very influential USAF generals were so dissatisfied with the state of Air Force UFO investigations that they dismantled Project Grudge and replaced it with Project Blue Book in early 1952. One of these men was Gen. <a href="/wiki/Charles_P._Cabell" title="Charles P. Cabell">Charles P. Cabell</a>. Another important change came when General <a href="/w/index.php?title=William_Garland_(Air_Force_Officer)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="William Garland (Air Force Officer) (page does not exist)">William Garland</a> joined Cabell's staff; Garland thought the UFO question deserved serious scrutiny because he had witnessed a UFO<sup id="cite_ref-swords103_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-swords103-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>The new name, Project Blue Book, was selected to refer to the blue booklets used for testing at some colleges and universities. The name was inspired, said Ruppelt, by the close attention that high-ranking officers were giving the new project; it felt as if the study of UFOs was as important as a college final exam. Blue Book was also upgraded in status from Project Grudge, with the creation of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Aerial_Phenomenon_Branch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Aerial Phenomenon Branch (page does not exist)">Aerial Phenomenon Branch</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Ruppelt was the first head of the project. He was an experienced airman, having been decorated for his efforts with the Army Air Corps during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and having afterwards earned an aeronautics degree. He officially coined the term "Unidentified Flying Object", to replace the many terms ("flying saucer" "flying disk" and so on) the military had previously used; Ruppelt thought that "unidentified flying object" was a more neutral and accurate term. Ruppelt resigned from the Air Force some years later, and wrote the book <i>The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects</i>, which described the study of UFOs by United States Air Force from 1947 to 1955. Swords writes that "Ruppelt would lead the last genuine effort to analyze UFOs"<sup id="cite_ref-swords102_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-swords102-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Ruppelt implemented a number of changes: He streamlined the manner in which UFOs were reported to (and by) military officials, partly in hopes of alleviating the stigma and ridicule associated with UFO witnesses. Ruppelt also ordered the development of a standard questionnaire for UFO witnesses, hoping to uncover data which could be subject to statistical analysis. He commissioned the <a href="/wiki/Battelle_Memorial_Institute" title="Battelle Memorial Institute">Battelle Memorial Institute</a> to create the questionnaire and computerize the data. Using case reports and the computerized data, Battelle then did a massive scientific and statistical study of all Air Force UFO cases, completed in 1954 and known as "<a href="/wiki/Project_Blue_Book#Project_Blue_Book_Special_Report_No._14" title="Project Blue Book">Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14</a>" (see summary below).</p>
<p>Knowing that factionalism had harmed the progress of <a href="/wiki/Project_Sign" title="Project Sign">Project Sign</a>, Ruppelt did his best to avoid the kinds of open-ended speculation that had led to Sign’s personnel being split among advocates and critics of the <a href="/wiki/Extraterrestrial_hypothesis" title="Extraterrestrial hypothesis">extraterrestrial hypothesis</a>. As Michael Hall writes, "Ruppelt not only took the job seriously but expected his staff to do so as well. If anyone under him either became too skeptical or too convinced of one particular theory, they soon found themselves off the project."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> In his book, Ruppelt reported that he fired three personnel very early in the project because they were either "too pro" or "too con" one hypotheis or another. Ruppelt sought the advice of many scientists and experts, and issued regular <a href="/wiki/Press_releases" title="Press releases" class="mw-redirect">press releases</a> (along with classified monthly reports for military intelligence).</p>
<p>Each U.S. Air Force Base had a Blue Book officer to collect UFO reports and forward them to Ruppelt<sup id="cite_ref-Blum_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blum-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>. During most of Ruppelt's tenure, he and his team were authorized to interview any and all military personnel who witnessed UFOs, and were not required to follow the <a href="/wiki/Chain_of_command" title="Chain of command">chain of command</a>. This unprecedented authority underlined the seriousness of Blue Book's investigation.</p>
<p>Under Ruppelt's direction, Blue Book investigated a number of well-known UFO cases, including the so-called <a href="/wiki/Lubbock_Lights" title="Lubbock Lights">Lubbock Lights</a>, and a widely publicized 1952 radar/visual case over <a href="/wiki/Washington_D.C." title="Washington D.C." class="mw-redirect">Washington D.C.</a>. According to <a href="/wiki/Jacques_Vallee" title="Jacques Vallee" class="mw-redirect">Jacques Vallee</a><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup>, Ruppelt started the trend, largely followed by later Blue Book investigations, of not giving serious consideration to numerous reports of UFO landings and/or interaction with purported UFO occupants.</p>
<p>Astronomer Dr. <a href="/wiki/Allen_Hynek" title="Allen Hynek" class="mw-redirect">J. Allen Hynek</a> was the scientific consultant of the project, as he had been with Projects Sign and Grudge. He worked for the project up to its termination and initially created the categorization which has been extended and is known today as <a href="/wiki/Close_encounter" title="Close encounter">Close encounters</a>. He was a pronounced skeptic when he started, but said that his feelings changed to a more wavering skepticism during the research, after encountering a few UFO reports he thought were unexplainable.</p>
<p>Ruppelt left Blue Book in February 1953 for a temporary reassignment. He returned a few months later to find his staff reduced from more than ten, to two subordinates. Frustrated, Ruppelt suggested that an Air Defense Command unit (the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron) be charged with UFO investigations.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Project_Blue_Book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Robertson panel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Robertson panel</span></h4>
<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Robertson_Panel" title="Robertson Panel">Robertson Panel</a></div>
<p>In July 1952, after a build-up of hundreds of sightings over the previous few months, a series of radar detections coincident with visual sightings were observed near the National Airport in Washington, D.C. (see <a href="/wiki/1952_Washington_D.C._UFO_incident" title="1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident">1952 Washington D.C. UFO incident</a>). One of the eye-witnesses was John McCain<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since December 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>.</p>
<p>After much publicity, these sightings led the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> to establish a panel of scientists headed by Dr. H. P. Robertson, a physicist of the California Institute of Technology, which included various physicists, meteorologists, and engineers, and one astronomer (Hynek). The Robertson Panel first met on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1953-01-14"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="01-14"><a href="/wiki/January_14" title="January 14">January 14</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1953" title="1953">1953</a></span> in order to formulate a response to the overwhelming public interest in UFOs.</p>
<p>Ruppelt, Hynek, and others presented the best evidence, including movie footage, that had been collected by Blue Book. After spending 12 hours reviewing 6 years of data, the Robertson Panel concluded that most UFO reports had prosaic explanations, and that all could be explained with further investigation, which they deemed not worth the effort.</p>
<p>In their final report, they stressed that low-grade, unverifiable UFO reports were overloading intelligence channels, with the risk of missing a genuine conventional threat to the U.S. Therefore, they recommended the Air Force de-emphasize the subject of UFOs and embark on a debunking campaign to lessen public interest. They suggested debunkery through the mass media, including <a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>, and using psychologists, astronomers, and celebrities to ridicule the phenomenon and put forward prosaic explanations. Furthermore, civilian UFO groups "should be watched because of their potentially great influence on mass thinking… The apparent irresponsibility and the possible use of such groups for subversive purposes should be kept in mind."</p>
<p>It is the conclusion of many researchers<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Blum_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blum-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> that the Robertson Panel was recommending controlling public opinion through a program of official propaganda and spying. They also believe these recommendations helped shape Air Force policy regarding UFO study not only immediately afterwards, but also into the present day. There is evidence that the Panel's recommendations were being carried out at least two decades after its conclusions were issued (see the main article for details and citations).</p>
<p>In December 1953, Joint Army-Navy-Air Force Regulation number 146 made it a crime for military personnel to discuss classified UFO reports with unauthorized persons. Violators faced up to two years in prison and/or fines of up to $10,000.</p>

<p>In his book (see external links) Ruppelt described the demoralization of the Blue Book staff and the stripping of their investigative duties following the Robertson Panel. As an immediate consequence of the Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye.</p>
<p>The same month, investigative duties started to be taken on by the newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command. The 4602nd AISS was tasked with investigating only the most important UFO cases with intelligence or national security implications. These were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports.</p>
<p>General <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Twining" title="Nathan Twining" class="mw-redirect">Nathan Twining</a>, who got Project Sign started back in 1947, was now Air Force Chief of Staff. In August 1954, he was to further codify the responsibilities of the 4602nd AISS by issuing an updated Air Force Regulation 200-2. In addition, UFOs (called "UFOBs") were defined as "any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object." Investigation of UFOs was stated to be for the purposes of national security and to ascertain "technical aspects." AFR 200-2 again stated that Blue Book could discuss UFO cases with the media only if they were regarded as having a conventional explanation. If they were unidentified, the media was to be told only that the situation was being analyzed. Blue Book was also ordered to reduce the number of unidentified to a minimum.</p>
<p>All this was done secretly. The public face of Blue Book continued to be the official Air Force investigation of UFOs, but the reality was it had essentially been reduced to doing very little serious investigation, and had become almost solely a public relations outfit with a debunking mandate. To cite one example, by the end of 1956, the number of cases listed as unsolved had dipped to barely 0.4 percent, from the 20 to 30% it had been only a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Eventually, Ruppelt requested reassignment; at his departure in August 1953, his staff had been reduced from more than ten (precise numbers of personnel varied) to just two subordinates and himself. His temporary replacement was a <a href="/wiki/Noncommissioned_officer" title="Noncommissioned officer" class="mw-redirect">noncommissioned officer</a>. Most who succeeded him as Blue Book director exhibited either apathy or outright hostility to the subject of UFOs, or were hampered by a lack of funding and official support.</p>
<p>UFO investigators often regard Ruppelt's brief tenure at Blue Book as the high-water mark of public Air Force investigations of UFOs, when UFO investigations were treated seriously and had support at high levels<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>. Thereafter, Project Blue Book descended into a new "Dark Ages" from which many UFO investigators argue it never emerged<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>. However, Ruppelt later came to embrace the Blue Book perspective that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs; he even labeled the subject a "Space Age Myth."</p>

<p>In March 1954, Captain Charles Hardin was appointed the head of Blue Book. However, most UFO investigations were conducted by the 4602nd, and Hardin had no objection. Ruppelt wrote that Hardin "thinks that anyone who is even interested [in UFOs] is crazy. They bore him."<sup id="cite_ref-clark468_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark468-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1955, the Air Force decided that the goal of Blue Book should be not to investigate UFO reports, but rather to reduce the number of unidentified UFO reports to a minimum. By late 1956, the number of unidentifed sightings had dropped from the 20-25% of the Ruppelt era, to less than 1%.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Project_Blue_Book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: The Captain Gregory era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Captain Gregory era</span></h3>
<p>Captain George T. Gregory took over as Blue Book's director in 1956. Clark writes that Gregory led Blue Book "in an even firmer anti-UFO direction than the apathetic Hardin."<sup id="cite_ref-clark468_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark468-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> The 4602nd was dissolved, and the 1066th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was charged with UFO investigations.</p>
<p>In fact, there was actually little or no investigation of UFO reports; a revised AFR 200-2 issued during Gregory's tenure emphasized that unidentified UFO reports must be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<p>One way that Gregory reduced the number of unexplained UFOs was by simple reclassification. "Possible cases" became "probable", and "probable" cases were upgraded to certainties. By this logic, a <i>possible</i> <a href="/wiki/Comet" title="Comet">comet</a> became a <i>probable</i> comet, while a probable comet was flatly declared to have been a misidentified comet. Similarly, if a witness reported an observation of an unusual balloon-<i>like</i> object, Blue Book usually classified it as a balloon, with no research and qualification. These procedures became standard for most of Blue Book's later investigations; see Hynek's comments below.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Project_Blue_Book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: The Major Friend era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Major Friend era</span></h3>
<p>Major Robert J. Friend was appointed the head of Blue Book in 1958. Friend made some attempts to reverse the direction Blue Book had taken since 1954. Clark writes that "Friend's efforts to upgrade the files and catalog sightings according to various observed statistics were frustrated by a lack of funding and assistance."<sup id="cite_ref-clark468_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark468-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Heartened by Friend's efforts, Hynek organized the first of several meetings between Blue Book staffers and ATIC personnel in 1959. Hynek suggested that some older UFO reports should be reevaluated, with the ostensible aim of moving them from the "unknown" to the "identified" category. Hynek's plans came to naught.</p>
<p>During Friend's tenure, ATIC contemplated passing oversight Blue Book to another Air Force agency, but neither the Air Research and Development Center, nor the Office of Information for the Secretary of the Air Force was interested.</p>
<p>In 1960, there were U.S. Congressional hearings regarding UFOs. Civilian UFO research group <a href="/wiki/National_Investigations_Committee_On_Aerial_Phenomena" title="National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena">NICAP</a> had publicly charged Blue Book with covering up UFO evidence, and had also acquired a few allies in the U.S. Congress. Blue Book was investigated by the Congress and the CIA, with critics -- most notably the civilian UFO group NICAP<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> that Blue Book was lacking as a scientific study. In response, ATIC added personnel (increasing the total personnel to three military personnel, plus civilian secretaries) and increased Blue Book's budget. This seemed to mollify some of Blue Book's critics,<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> that but it was only temporary. A few years later (see below), the criticism would be even louder.</p>
<p>By the time he was transferred from Blue Book in 1963, Friend thought that Blue Book was effectively useless and ought to be dissolved, even if it caused an outcry amongst the public.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Project_Blue_Book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: The Major Quintanilla era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Major Quintanilla era</span></h3>
<p>Major <a href="/wiki/Hector_Quintanilla" title="Hector Quintanilla">Hector Quintanilla</a> took over as Blue Book's leader in August 1963. He largely continued the debunking efforts, and it was under his direction that Blue Book received some of its sharpest criticism. UFO researcher Jerome Clark goes so far as to write that, by this time, Blue Book had "lost all credibility."<sup id="cite_ref-clark592_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark592-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Physicist and UFO researcher Dr. <a href="/wiki/James_E._McDonald" title="James E. McDonald">James E. McDonald</a> once flatly declared that Quintanilla was "not competent" from either a scientific or an investigative perspective.<sup id="cite_ref-Druffel63_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Druffel63-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> However, McDonald also stressed that Quintanilla "shouldn't be held accountable for it", as he was chosen for his position by a superior officer, and was following orders in directing Blue Book.<sup id="cite_ref-Druffel63_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Druffel63-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Blue Book’s explanations of UFO reports were not universally accepted, however, and critics — including some scientists — suggested that Project Blue Book was engaged in questionable research or, worse, perpetrating <a href="/wiki/Cover_up" title="Cover up" class="mw-redirect">cover up</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> This criticism grew especially strong and widespread in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Take for example, the many mostly nighttime UFO reports from the midwestern and southeastern United States in the summer of 1965: Witnesses in <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> reported "multicolored lights" and large aerial objects shaped like <a href="/wiki/Egg_(biology)" title="Egg (biology)">eggs</a> or diamonds.<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported that <a href="/wiki/Tinker_Air_Force_Base" title="Tinker Air Force Base">Tinker Air Force Base</a> (near <a href="/wiki/Oklahoma_City" title="Oklahoma City">Oklahoma City</a>) had tracked up to four UFO’s simultaneously, and that several of them had descended very rapidly: from about 22000 feet to about 4000 feet in just a few seconds,<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> an action well beyond the capabilities of conventional aircraft of the era. John Shockley, a <a href="/wiki/Meteorologist" title="Meteorologist" class="mw-redirect">meteorologist</a> from <a href="/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas" title="Wichita, Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a>, reported that, using the state Weather Bureau <a href="/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a>, he tracked a number of odd aerial objects flying at altitudes between about 6000 and 9000 feet.<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> These and other reports received wide publicity.</p>
<p>Project Blue Book officially determined<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> the witnesses had mistaken <a href="/wiki/Jupiter_(planet)" title="Jupiter (planet)" class="mw-redirect">Jupiter</a> or bright <a href="/wiki/Star" title="Star">stars</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Rigel" title="Rigel">Rigel</a> or <a href="/wiki/Betelgeuse" title="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a>) for something else.</p>
<p>Blue Book’s explanation was widely criticized as inaccurate. Robert Riser, director of the Oklahoma Science and Art Foundation <a href="/wiki/Planetarium" title="Planetarium">Planetarium</a> offered a strongly-worded rebuke of Project Blue Book that was widely circulated: “That is as far from the truth as you can get. These stars and <a href="/wiki/Planet" title="Planet">planets</a> are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City at this time of year. The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">Air Force</a> must have had its star finder upside-down during August."<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A newspaper editorial from the <i>Richmond News Leader</i> opined that "Attempts to dismiss the reported sightings under the rationale as exhibited by Project Bluebook (sic) won’t solve the mystery … and serve only to heighten the suspicion that there’s something out there that the air force doesn't want us to know about",<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> while a Wichita-based <a href="/wiki/UPI" title="UPI" class="mw-redirect">UPI</a> reporter noted that "Ordinary radar does not pick up planets and stars."<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Another case that Blue Book's critics seized upon was the so-called <a href="/wiki/Portage_County_UFO_Chase" title="Portage County UFO Chase" class="mw-redirect">Portage County UFO Chase</a>, which began at about 5.00am, near <a href="/wiki/Ravenna,_Ohio" title="Ravenna, Ohio">Ravenna, Ohio</a> on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1966-04-17"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="04-17"><a href="/wiki/April_17" title="April 17">April 17</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1966" title="1966">1966</a></span>. Police officers Dale Spaur and Wilbur Neff spotted what they described as a disc-shaped, silvery object with a bright light emanating from its underside, at about 1000 feet in altitude.<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> They began following the object (which they reported sometimes descended as low as 50 feet), and police from several other jurisdictions were involved in the pursuit. The chase ended about 30 minutes later near <a href="/wiki/Freedom,_Pennsylvania" title="Freedom, Pennsylvania">Freedom, Pennsylvania</a>, some 85 miles away.</p>
<p>The UFO chase made national news, and the police submitted detailed reports to Blue Book. Five days later, following brief interviews with only one of the police officers (but none of the other ground witnesses), Blue Book's director, Major <a href="/wiki/Hector_Quintanilla" title="Hector Quintanilla">Hector Quintanilla</a>, announced their conclusions: The police (one of them an Air Force gunner during the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>) had first chased a <a href="/wiki/Communications_satellite" title="Communications satellite">communications satellite</a>, then the planet Venus.</p>
<p>This conclusion was widely derided,<sup id="cite_ref-clark_9-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> and was strenuously rejected by the police officers. In his dissenting conclusion, Hynek described Blue Book's conclusions as absurd: in their reports, several of the police had unknowingly described the moon, Venus <i>and</i> the UFO, though they unknowingly described Venus as a bright "star" very near the moon. Ohio Congressman <a href="/wiki/William_Stanton" title="William Stanton">William Stanton</a> said that "The Air Force has suffered a great loss of prestige in this community … Once people entrusted with the public welfare no longer think the people can handle the truth, then the people, in return, will no longer trust the government."</p>
<p>In September 1968, Hynek received a letter from Colonel Raymond Sleeper of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Foreign_Technology_Division&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Foreign Technology Division (page does not exist)">Foreign Technology Division</a>. Sleeper noted that Hynek had publicly accused Blue Book of shoddy science, and further asked Hynek to offer advice on how Blue Book could improve its scientific methodology. Hynek was to later declare that Sleeper's letter was "the first time in my 20 year association with the air force as scientific consultant that I had been officially asked for criticism and advice [regarding] … the UFO problem."<sup id="cite_ref-clark477_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clark477-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Hynek wrote a detailed response, dated <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1968-10-07"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="10-07"><a href="/wiki/October_7" title="October 7">October 7</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1968" title="1968">1968</a></span>, suggesting several areas where Blue Book could improve. In part, he wrote:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-latin">
<li>... neither of the two missions of Blue Book [determining if UFOs are a threat to national security and using scientific data gathered by Blue Book] are being adequately executed.</li>
<li>The staff of Blue Book, both in numbers and in scientific training, is grossly inadequate...</li>
<li>Blue Book suffers … in that it is a closed system ... there is virtually no scientific dialogue between Blue Book and the outside scientific world...</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Statistics" title="Statistics">statistical</a> methods employed by Blue Book are nothing less than a travesty.</li>
<li>There has been a lack of attention to significant UFO cases ... and too much time spent on routine cases ... and on peripheral public relations tasks. Concentration could be on two or three potentially scientific significant cases per month [instead of being] spread thin over 40 to 70 cases per month.</li>
<li>The information input to Blue Book is grossly inadequate. An impossible load is placed on Blue Book by the almost consistent failure of UFO officers at local air bases to transmit adequate information...</li>
<li>The basic attitude and approach within Blue Book is illogical and unscientific...</li>
<li>Inadequate use had been made of the Project scientific consultant [Hynek himself]. Only cases that the <i>project monitor</i> deems worthwhile are brought to his attention. His scope of operation ... has been consistently thwarted ... He often learns of interesting cases only a month or two after the receipt of the report at Blue Book.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Despite Sleeper's request for criticism, none of Hynek's commentary resulted in any substantial changes in Blue Book.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Hector_Quintanilla" title="Hector Quintanilla">Quinatnilla's</a> own perspective on the project is documented in his manuscript, "<a href="http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/quintanilla.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.nidsci.org/pdf/quintanilla.pdf" rel="nofollow">UFOs, An Air Force Dilemma</a>.” Lt.

<p>Following U.S. Congressional hearings, the <a href="/wiki/Condon_Committee" title="Condon Committee">Condon Committee</a> was established in 1966, ostensibly as a neutral scientific research body.

<p>From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force investigated Unidentified Flying Objects under Project Blue Book. The project, headquartered at <a href="/wiki/Wright-Patterson_Air_Force_Base" title="Wright-Patterson Air Force Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a>, Ohio, was terminated <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1969-12-17"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="12-17"><a href="/wiki/December_17" title="December 17">December 17</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1969" title="1969">1969</a></span>. Of a total of 12,618 sightings reported to Project Blue Book, 701 remained "unidentified."</p>
<p>The decision to discontinue UFO investigations was based on an evaluation of a report prepared by the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Colorado_at_Boulder" title="University of Colorado at Boulder">University of Colorado</a> entitled, "<a href="/wiki/Condon_Report" title="Condon Report" class="mw-redirect">Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects</a>;" a review of the University of Colorado's report by the National Academy of Sciences; previous UFO studies and Air Force experience investigating UFO reports during 1940 to 1969.</p>
<p>As a result of these investigations, studies and experience gained from investigating UFO reports since 1948, the conclusions of Project Blue Book were:</p>
<ol>
<li>No UFO reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force has ever given any indication of threat to our national security.</li>
<li>There has been no evidence submitted to or discovered by the Air Force that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represent technological developments or principles beyond the range of present day scientific knowledge.</li>
<li>There has been no evidence indicating the sightings categorized as "unidentified" are extraterrestrial vehicles.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the termination of Project Blue Book, the Air Force regulation establishing and controlling the program for investigating and analyzing UFOs was rescinded. Documentation regarding the former Blue Book investigation was permanently transferred to the Modern Military Branch, <a href="/wiki/National_Archives" title="National Archives" class="mw-redirect">National Archives</a> and Records Service, and is available for public review and analysis.</p>
<p>Since the termination of Project Blue Book, nothing has occurred that would support a resumption of UFO investigations by the Air Force.</p>
<p>There are a number of universities and professional scientific organizations that have considered UFO phenomena during periodic meetings and seminars. A list of private organizations interested in aerial phenomena may be found in "Encyclopaedia of Associations", published by Gale Research. Interest in and timely review of UFO reports by private groups ensures that sound evidence is not overlooked by the scientific community. Persons wishing to report UFO sightings should be advised to contact local law enforcement agencies.</p>

Bolander</a> states that even after Blue Book was dissolved, that "reports of UFOs" would still "continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedure designed for this purpose." Furthermore, wrote Bolander, "Reports of unidentified flying objects which could affect national security … are not part of the Blue Book system."<sup id="cite_ref-Randles179_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Randles179-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> To date, these other investigation channels, agencies or groups are unknown.</p>
<p>Additionally, Blum reports<sup id="cite_ref-Blum_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blum-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> that <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)" title="Freedom of Information Act (United States)">Freedom of Information Act</a> requests show that the U.S. Air Force has continued to catalog and track UFO sightings, particularly a series of dozens of UFO encounters from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s that occurred at U.S. military facilities with <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapons" title="Nuclear weapons" class="mw-redirect">nuclear weapons</a>. Blum writes that some of these official documents depart drastically from the normally dry and bureaucratic wording of government paperwork, making obvious the sense of "terror" that these UFO incidents inspired in many U.S.A.F. personnel.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Project_Blue_Book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14</span></h2>
<p>In late December 1951, Ruppelt met with members of the <a href="/wiki/Battelle_Memorial_Institute" title="Battelle Memorial Institute">Battelle Memorial Institute</a>, a think tank based in Columbus, Ohio. Ruppelt wanted their experts to assist them in making the Air Force UFO study more scientific. It was the Battelle Institute that devised the standardized reporting form. Starting in late March 1952, the Institute started analyzing existing sighting reports and encoding about 30 report characteristics onto <a href="/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a> <a href="/wiki/Punch_cards" title="Punch cards" class="mw-redirect">punch cards</a> for computer analysis.</p>
<p>Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14 was their massive statistical analysis of Blue Book cases to date, some 3200 by the time the report was completed in 1954, after Ruppelt had left Blue Book. Even today, it represents the largest such study ever undertaken. Battelle employed four scientific analysts, who sought to divide cases into "knowns", "unknowns", and a third category of "insufficient information." They also broke down knowns and unknowns into four categories of quality, from excellent to poor. E.g., cases deemed excellent might typically involve experienced witnesses such as airline pilots or trained military personnel, multiple witnesses, corroborating evidence such as radar contact or photographs, etc. In order for a case to be deemed a "known", only two analysts had to independently agree on a solution. However, for a case to be called an "unknown", all four analysts had to agree. Thus the criterion for an "unknown" was quite stringent.</p>
<p>In addition, sightings were broken down into six different characteristics — color, number, duration of observation, brightness, shape, and speed — and then these characteristics were compared between knowns and unknowns to see if there was a statistically significant difference.</p>
<p>The main results of the statistical analysis were:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 69% of the cases were judged known or identified (38% were considered conclusively identified while 31% were still "doubtfully" explained); about 9% fell into insufficient information. About 22% were deemed "unknown", down from the earlier 28% value of the Air Force studies.</li>
<li>In the known category, 86% of the knowns were aircraft, balloons, or had astronomical explanations. Only 1.5% of all cases were judged to be psychological or "<a href="/wiki/Crackpot_(person)" title="Crackpot (person)" class="mw-redirect">crackpot</a>" cases. A "miscellaneous" category comprised 8% of all cases and included possible hoaxes.</li>
<li>The higher the quality of the case, the more likely it was to be classified unknown. 35% of the excellent cases were deemed unknowns, whereas only 18% of the poorest cases. This was the exact opposite result predicted by skeptics, who usually argued unknowns were poorer quality cases involving unreliable witnesses that could be solved if only better information were available.</li>
<li>In all six studied sighting characteristics, the unknowns were different from the knowns at a highly statistically significant level: in five of the six measures the odds of knowns differing from unknowns by chance was only 1% or less. When all six characteristics were considered together, the probability of a match between knowns and unknowns was less than 1 in a billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>(More detailed statistics can be found at <a href="/wiki/Identified_flying_object" title="Identified flying object" class="mw-redirect">Identified flying objects</a>.)</p>
<p>Despite this, the summary section of the Battelle Institute's final report declared it was "highly improbable that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects... represent observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day knowledge." A number of researchers, including Dr. <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Maccabee" title="Bruce Maccabee">Bruce Maccabee</a>, who extensively reviewed the data, have noted that the conclusions of the analysts were usually at odds with their own statistical results, displayed in 240 charts, tables, graphs and maps. Some conjecture that the analysts may simply have had trouble accepting their own results or may have written the conclusions to satisfy the new political climate within Blue Book following the Robertson Panel.</p>
<p>When the Air Force finally made Special Report #14 public in October 1955, it was claimed that the report scientifically proved that UFOs did not exist. Critics of this claim note that the report actually proved that the "unknowns" were distinctly different from the "knowns" at a very high <a href="/wiki/Statistical_significance" title="Statistical significance">statistical significance</a> level. The Air Force also incorrectly claimed that only 3% of the cases studied were unknowns, instead of the actual 22%. They further claimed that the residual 3% would probably disappear if more complete data were available. Critics counter that this ignored the fact that the analysts had already thrown such cases into the category of "insufficient information", whereas both "knowns" and "unknowns" were deemed to have sufficient information to make a determination. Also the "unknowns" tended to represent the higher quality cases, i.e. reports that already had better information and witnesses.</p>
<p>The result of the monumental BMI study were echoed by a 1979 French <a href="/wiki/GEIPAN" title="GEIPAN">GEPAN</a> report which stated that about a quarter of over 1,600 closely studied UFO cases defied explanation, stating, in part, "These cases … pose a real question."<sup id="cite_ref-Randles2202_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Randles2202-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> When GEPAN's successor <a href="/wiki/GEIPAN" title="GEIPAN">SEPRA</a> closed in 2004, 5800 cases had been analyzed, and the percentage of inexplicable unknowns had dropped to about 14%. The head of SEPRA, Dr. <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jean-Jacques_Velasco&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jean-Jacques Velasco (page does not exist)">Jean-Jacques Velasco</a>, found the evidence of extraterrestrial origins so convincing in these remaining unknowns, that he wrote a book about it in 2005.<a href="http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1627.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1627.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Project_Blue_Book&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Edit section: Hynek's criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Hynek's criticism</span></h2>
<p>Hynek was an associate member of the <a href="/wiki/Robertson_Panel" title="Robertson Panel">Robertson Panel</a>, which recommended that UFOs needed <a href="/wiki/Debunker" title="Debunker">debunking</a>. A few years later, however, Hynek's opinions about UFOs changed, and he thought they represented an unsolved mystery deserving scientific scrutiny. As the only scientist involved with U.S. Government UFO studies from the beginning to the end, he could offer a unique persepective on Projects Sign, Grudge and Blue Book.</p>
<p>After what he described as a promising beginning with a potential for scientific research, Hynek grew increasingly disenchanted with Blue Book during his tenure with the project, leveling accusations of indifference, incompetence, and of shoddy research on the part of Air Force personnel. Hynek notes that during its existence, critics dubbed Blue Book "The Society for the Explanation of the Uninvestigated".<sup id="cite_ref-Hynek180_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hynek180-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Blue Book was headed by Ruppelt, then Captain Hardin, Captain Gregory, Major Friend and, finally, Major Hector Quintanilla. Hynek had kind words only for Ruppelt and Friend. Of Ruppelt, he wrote "In my contacts with him I found him to be honest and seriously puzzled about the whole phenomenon".<sup id="cite_ref-Hynek175_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hynek175-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Of Friend, he wrote "Of all the officers I worked with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect. Whatever private views he may have held, he was a total and practical realist, and sitting where he could see the scoreboard, he recognized the limitations of his office but conducted himself with dignity and a total lack of the bombast that characterized several of the other Blue Book heads."<sup id="cite_ref-Hynek187_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hynek187-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>He held Quintanilla in especially low regard: "Quintanilla's method was simple: disregard any evidence that was counter to his hypothesis."<sup id="cite_ref-Hynek103_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hynek103-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> Hynek wrote that during Air Force Major <a href="/wiki/Hector_Quintanilla" title="Hector Quintanilla">Hector Quintanilla</a>'s tenure as Blue Book's director, “the flag of the utter nonsense school was flying at its highest on the mast.” Hynek reported that Sergeant David Moody, one of Quintanilla’s subordinates, “epitomized the conviction-before-trial method. Anything that he didn’t understand or didn’t like was immediately put into the psychological category, which meant ‘<a href="/wiki/Crackpot_(person)" title="Crackpot (person)" class="mw-redirect">crackpot</a>’.”</p>
<p>Hynek reported bitter exchanges with Moody when the latter refused to research UFO sightings thoroughly, describing Moody as “the master of the possible: possible balloon, possible aircraft, possible birds, which then became, by his own hand (and I argued with him violently at times) the probable.”</p>

<p>Project Blue Book was the inspiration for the 1978–1979 TV show <i><a href="/wiki/Project_UFO" title="Project UFO">Project UFO</a></i>, which was supposedly based on Project Blue Book cases.

<p>Project Blue Book played a major role in the second season of the 1990–1991 TV series <i><a href="/wiki/Twin_Peaks" title="Twin Peaks">Twin Peaks</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Major_Garland_Briggs" title="Major Garland Briggs" class="mw-redirect">Major Garland Briggs</a>, an Air Force officer who worked on the program, approaches protagonist <a href="/wiki/Dale_Cooper" title="Dale Cooper">Dale Cooper</a> and reveals that Cooper's name turned up in an otherwise nonsensical radio transmission intercepted by the Air Force, which inexplicably originated from the woods surrounding the town of Twin Peaks.

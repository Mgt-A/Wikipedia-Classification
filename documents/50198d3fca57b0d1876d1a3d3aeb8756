<p>In <a href="/wiki/Music" title="Music">music</a>, <b>sampling</b> is the act of taking a portion, or <b>sample</b>, of one <a href="/wiki/Sound_recording" title="Sound recording" class="mw-redirect">sound recording</a> and reusing it as an <a href="/wiki/Musical_instrument" title="Musical instrument">instrument</a> or a different sound recording of a song. This is typically done with a <a href="/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)" title="Sampler (musical instrument)">sampler</a>, which can be a piece of hardware or a <a href="/wiki/Computer_software" title="Computer software">computer program</a> on a digital computer. Sampling is also possible with <a href="/wiki/Tape_loop" title="Tape loop">tape loops</a> or with <a href="/wiki/Vinyl_record" title="Vinyl record" class="mw-redirect">vinyl records</a> on a <a href="/wiki/Phonograph" title="Phonograph">phonograph</a>.</p>
<p>Often "samples" consist of one part of a song, such as a <a href="/wiki/Break_(music)" title="Break (music)">break</a>, used in another, for instance the use of the drum introduction from <a href="/wiki/Led_Zeppelin" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/When_the_Levee_Breaks" title="When the Levee Breaks">When the Levee Breaks</a>" in songs by the <a href="/wiki/Beastie_Boys" title="Beastie Boys">Beastie Boys</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dr._Dre" title="Dr. Dre">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eminem" title="Eminem">Eminem</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mike_Oldfield" title="Mike Oldfield">Mike Oldfield</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rob_Dougan" title="Rob Dougan">Rob Dougan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Coldcut" title="Coldcut">Coldcut</a>, <a href="/wiki/Depeche_Mode" title="Depeche Mode">Depeche Mode</a> and <a href="/wiki/Erasure" title="Erasure">Erasure</a>, and the guitar riffs from <a href="/wiki/Foreigner_(band)" title="Foreigner (band)">Foreigner</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Hot_Blooded" title="Hot Blooded">Hot Blooded</a>" in <a href="/wiki/Tone-Loc" title="Tone-Loc" class="mw-redirect">Tone-Loc</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Funky_Cold_Medina" title="Funky Cold Medina">Funky Cold Medina</a>".

<p>Sampling has been an area of contention from a legal perspective. Early sampling artists simply used portions of other artists' recordings, without permission; once rap and other music incorporating samples began to make significant money, the original artists began to take legal action, claiming <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> infringement. Some sampling artists fought back, claiming their samples were <a href="/wiki/Fair_use" title="Fair use">fair use</a> (a legal doctrine in the USA that is <i>not</i> universal). International sampling is governed by agreements such as the <a href="/wiki/Berne_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works" title="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works">Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works</a> and the <a href="/wiki/WIPO_Copyright_and_Performances_and_Phonograms_Treaties_Implementation_Act" title="WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act">WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Sampling_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Early cases">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early cases</span></h3>
<p>Sampling existing (copyrighted) recordings using manipulation with tape recorders goes back at least as far as 1961, when <a href="/wiki/James_Tenney" title="James Tenney">James Tenney</a> created Collage #1 ("Blue Suede") from samples of <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s recording of the song "<a href="/wiki/Blue_Suede_Shoes" title="Blue Suede Shoes">Blue Suede Shoes</a>."</p>
<p>At the time, many artists such as <a href="/wiki/Brion_Gysin" title="Brion Gysin">Brion Gysin</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_S._Burroughs" title="William S. Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a> were experimenting with the new technology that was tape-recording by manipulating existing works such as radio broadcasts. Brion Gysin's work tended to favor his permutation poems as the vehicle for cut-ups with spliced repetition of the same series of words rearranged in every conceivable pattern, frequently utilizing snippets of speeches or news broadcasts. Burroughs preferred a much more frantic and disorganized sound that would later spawn similar disjointed collage material from modern groups such as <a href="/wiki/Negativland" title="Negativland">negativland</a>. Burroughs would record, for instance, a radio broadcast about military action, then dub parts of the broadcast likely at random often stuttering and distorting the original work far beyond comprehension.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> also used the technique on a number of popular recordings in the mid' '60s, including "<a href="/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_(song)" title="Yellow Submarine (song)">Yellow Submarine</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/I_am_the_Walrus" title="I am the Walrus" class="mw-redirect">I am the Walrus</a>."</p>
<p>In the early 70's and early 80's, <a href="/wiki/DJ_Kool_Herc" title="DJ Kool Herc">DJ Kool Herc</a>, who is often credited as the inventor of hip-hop, often looped hard funk break beats at block parties in The Bronx. However, sampling did not truly take off in popular music until the early eighties when pioneering <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop" title="Hip hop">hip hop</a> producers, such as <a href="/wiki/Grandmaster_Flash" title="Grandmaster Flash">Grandmaster Flash</a>, started to produce <a href="/wiki/Rap_music" title="Rap music" class="mw-redirect">Rap</a> records using sampled <a href="/wiki/Break_(music)" title="Break (music)">breaks</a> rather than live studio bands, which had until then been the norm.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom would hold that the first popular rap single to feature sampling was "Rapper's Delight" by <a href="/wiki/Sugar_Hill_Gang" title="Sugar Hill Gang" class="mw-redirect">Sugar Hill Gang</a> on their own independent Sugar Hill Label in 1979. However, instead of 'sampling' the existing record "Good Times" by <a href="/wiki/Chic_(band)" title="Chic (band)">Chic</a>, Sugar Hill employed a house band, called "Positive Force" to record a copy of "Good Times" which was then rapped over. <a href="/wiki/Doug_Wimbish" title="Doug Wimbish">Doug Wimbish</a> and other session musicians were called upon to play live music on many classic Sugar Hill records. Those sounds are not samples but live musicians.</p>
<p>Earliest examples of this practice include <a href="/wiki/Grandmaster_Flash" title="Grandmaster Flash">Grandmaster Flash</a>'s - "<a href="/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Grandmaster_Flash_on_the_Wheels_of_Steel" title="The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel">The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel</a>" (1981) (which used the "Apache" break by the Incredible Bongo Bong Band amongst other famous breaks), Brother D and the Collective Effort's "How We Gonna Make The Black Nation Rise" (1984) (which sampled the beat and bass line from <a href="/wiki/Cheryl_Lynn" title="Cheryl Lynn">Cheryl Lynn</a>'s 1978 hit "Got to be Real") and UTFO's "Roxanne Roxanne" (1984). Bill Holt's <a href="/wiki/Dreamies" title="Dreamies">Dreamies</a> (1974) is often cited as one of the earliest examples of sampling in popular music. Another early example of sampling was <a href="/wiki/Big_Audio_Dynamite" title="Big Audio Dynamite">Big Audio Dynamite</a> and their 1985 album <i><a href="/wiki/This_Is_Big_Audio_Dynamite" title="This Is Big Audio Dynamite">This Is Big Audio Dynamite</a></i> and the single <a href="/wiki/E%3DMC%C2%B2_(song)" title="E=MC² (song)">E=MC²</a> which <a href="/wiki/Mick_Jones_(The_Clash)" title="Mick Jones (The Clash)">Mick Jones</a> (formerly of <a href="/wiki/The_Clash" title="The Clash">The Clash</a>) sampled snippets of audio from various films including works by <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Roeg" title="Nicolas Roeg">Nicolas Roeg</a> which make up the Roeg homage <a href="/wiki/E%3DMC%C2%B2_(song)" title="E=MC² (song)">E=MC²</a>. The 1981 album by <a href="/wiki/David_Byrne_(musician)" title="David Byrne (musician)" class="mw-redirect">David Byrne</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brian_Eno" title="Brian Eno">Brian Eno</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/My_Life_in_the_Bush_of_Ghosts_(album)" title="My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a></i>, used sampling extensively for the songs' vocals.</p>
<p>One of the first major legal cases regarding sampling was with UK dance act <a href="/wiki/MARRS" title="MARRS">M/A/R/R/S</a> "Pump Up the Volume". As the record reached the UK top ten, producers <a href="/wiki/Stock_Aitken_Waterman" title="Stock Aitken Waterman">Stock Aitken Waterman</a> obtained an injunction against the record due to the unauthorized use of a sample from their hit single "Roadblock". The dispute was settled out of court, with the injunction being lifted in return for an undertaking that overseas releases would not contain the "Roadblock" sample, and the disc went on to top the UK singles chart. Ironically, the sample in question had been so distorted as to be virtually unrecognizable, and SAW didn't realize their record had been used until they heard co-producer <a href="/w/index.php?title=Dave_Dorrell&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dave Dorrell (page does not exist)">Dave Dorrell</a> mention it in a radio interview.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/2_Live_Crew" title="2 Live Crew">2 Live Crew</a>, a hip-hop group familiar with controversy, was often in the spotlight for their 'obscene' and sexually explicit lyrics. They sparked many debates about censorship in the music industry. However, it was their 1989 album <i><a href="/wiki/As_Clean_as_They_Wanna_Be" title="As Clean as They Wanna Be" class="mw-redirect">As Clean as They Wanna Be</a></i> (a re-tooling of <i><a href="/wiki/As_Nasty_As_They_Wanna_Be" title="As Nasty As They Wanna Be">As Nasty As They Wanna Be</a></i>) that began the prolonged legal debate over sampling. The album contained a track entitled "Pretty Woman," based on the well known <a href="/wiki/Roy_Orbison" title="Roy Orbison">Roy Orbison</a> song of the same name. 2 Live Crew's version sampled the guitar, bass, and drums from the original, without permission. While the opening lines are the same, the two songs split ways immediately following.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roy Orbison's version – "Pretty woman, walking down the street/ Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet."<br />
2 Live Crew's version – "Big hairy woman, all that hair ain't legit,/ Cause you look like <a href="/wiki/Cousin_Itt" title="Cousin Itt">Cousin Itt</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to this, while the music is identifiable as the Orbison song, there were changes implemented by the group. The new version contained interposed scraper notes, overlays of solos in different keys, and an altered drum beat.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The group was sued by the song's copyright owners Acuff-Rose. The company claimed that 2 Live Crew's unauthorized use of the samples devalued the original, and was thus a case of copyright infringement. The group claimed they were protected under the fair use doctrine. The case of Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music came to the Supreme Court in 1994.<br />
In reviewing the case, the Supreme Court didn't consider previous ruling in which any commercial use (and economic gain) was considered copyright infringement. Instead they re-evaluated the original frame of copyright as set forth in the Constitution. The opinion that resulted from Emerson v. Davies played a major role in the decision.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[In] truth, in literature, in science and in art, there are, and can be, few, if any, things, which in an abstract sense, are strictly new and original throughout. Every book in literature, science and art, borrows, and must necessarily borrow, and use much which was well known and used before." Emerson v. Davies,8 F.Cas. 615, 619 (No. 4,436) (CCD Mass. 1845)<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps what played a larger role was the result from the Folsom v. Marsh case:<br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work."

<p>The court ruled that any financial gain 2 Live Crew received from their version did not infringe upon Acuff-Rose because the two songs were targeted at very different audiences. 2 Live Crew's use of copyrighted material was protected under the fair use doctrine, as a parody, even though it was released commercially.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>However, the case was appealed to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court" title="United States Supreme Court" class="mw-redirect">United States Supreme Court</a> where the decision was reversed with Justice David Souter writing that the lower court was wrong in its determination that parody alone was a sufficient reason to determine copyright infringement.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, <a href="/wiki/Vanilla_Ice" title="Vanilla Ice">Vanilla Ice</a> came under criticism for the unauthorised use of a sample from the <a href="/wiki/Queen_(band)" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a>/<a href="/wiki/David_Bowie" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a> hit "<a href="/wiki/Under_Pressure" title="Under Pressure">Under Pressure</a>". Vanilla Ice's case rested on the addition of one short note, a repetition of a note from the original<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. No lawsuit was filed, but it is conjectured that Vanilla Ice agreed to pay Queen and Bowie if they agreed not to sue.</p>
<p>More dramatically, <a href="/wiki/Biz_Markie" title="Biz Markie">Biz Markie</a>'s album <i>I Need a Haircut</i> was withdrawn in 1992 following a US federal court ruling,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> that his use of a sample from <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_O%27Sullivan" title="Gilbert O'Sullivan">Gilbert O'Sullivan</a>'s "<i><a href="/wiki/Alone_Again_(Naturally)" title="Alone Again (Naturally)">Alone Again (Naturally)</a></i>" was willful infringement. This case had a powerful effect on the record industry, with record companies becoming very much concerned with the legalities of sampling, and demanding that artists make full declarations of all samples used in their work. On the other hand, the ruling also made it more attractive to artists and record labels to allow others to sample their work, knowing that they would be paid—often handsomely—for their contribution.</p>
<p>A notable case in the early 1990s involved the dispute between the group <a href="/wiki/Negativland" title="Negativland">Negativland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Casey_Kasem" title="Casey Kasem">Casey Kasem</a> over the band's use of un-aired vocal snippets from Kasem's radio program America's Top 40 on the Negativland single "<a href="/wiki/Negativland#The_U2_record_incident" title="Negativland">U2</a>".</p>
<p>Another notable case involved British <a href="/wiki/Electronic_Dance_Music" title="Electronic Dance Music" class="mw-redirect">dance music</a> act <a href="/wiki/Shut_Up_And_Dance" title="Shut Up And Dance">Shut Up And Dance</a>. Shut Up And Dance were a fairly successful <a href="/wiki/Breakbeat_Hardcore" title="Breakbeat Hardcore" class="mw-redirect">Breakbeat Hardcore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rave_music" title="Rave music">rave</a> scene outfit who like their contemporaries had liberally used samples in the creation of their music - without clearance from the individuals concerned. Although frowned upon the British music industry usually turned a blind eye to this mainly underground scene, however with rave at its commercial peak in the UK, Shut Up And Dance released the single "Raving I'm Raving" an upbeat breakbeat hardcore record which shot to #2 on the <a href="/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart" title="UK Singles Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> in May 1992. At the core of "Raving" were significant samples of <a href="/wiki/Marc_Cohn" title="Marc Cohn">Marc Cohn</a>'s hit single "<a href="/wiki/Walking_in_Memphis" title="Walking in Memphis">Walking in Memphis</a>" with some of the lyrical content changed and sung by Peter Bouncer. Shut Up And Dance hadn't sought clearance from Marc Cohn for the samples they used in "Raving" and Marc Cohn took legal action against Shut Up And Dance for breach of copyright. An out of court settlement was eventually reached between Shut Up And Dance and Cohn which saw "Raving" in its current form banned and the proceeds from the single given to charity. Ironically Shut Up and Dance were later commissioned to produce remixes for <a href="/wiki/Cher" title="Cher">Cher's</a> 1995 cover version of "Walking In Memphis" and were allowed by Cohn to use parts from the deleted "Raving I'm Raving" for this remix.</p>
<p>The Shut Up And Dance case had major ramifications on the use of samples in the UK and most artists and record labels now seek clearance for samples they use. However there are still cases which involve UK artists using uncleared samples. In October 1996 <a href="/wiki/The_Chemical_Brothers" title="The Chemical Brothers">The Chemical Brothers</a> released the single <a href="/wiki/Setting_Sun" title="Setting Sun">Setting Sun</a> inspired by <a href="/wiki/The_Beatles" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> <a href="/wiki/Tomorrow_Never_Knows" title="Tomorrow Never Knows">Tomorrow Never Knows</a> and featuring <a href="/wiki/Oasis_(band)" title="Oasis (band)">Oasis'</a> <a href="/wiki/Noel_Gallagher" title="Noel Gallagher">Noel Gallagher</a> on vocals - a long admirer of The Beatles work. Setting Sun hit #1 on the <a href="/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart" title="UK Singles Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> on first week of release and the common consensus was The Chemical Brothers had sampled/looped significant parts of Tomorrow Never Knows in the creation of Setting Sun. The three remaining Beatles' took legal action against The Chemical Brothers/<a href="/wiki/Virgin_Records" title="Virgin Records">Virgin Records</a> for breach of copyright, however a <a href="/wiki/Musicology" title="Musicology">musicologist</a> proved The Chemical Brothers had independently created Setting Sun - albeit in a similar vein to Tomorrow Never Knows.</p>
<p>In 1997 <a href="/wiki/The_Verve" title="The Verve">The Verve</a> was forced to pay 100% of their royalties from their hit "<a href="/wiki/Bitter_Sweet_Symphony" title="Bitter Sweet Symphony">Bitter Sweet Symphony</a>" for the use of a licensed sample from an orchestral cover version of <a href="/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>' hit "The Last Time".<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The Rolling Stones' catalogue is one of the most litigiously protected in the world of popular music—to some extent the case mirrored the legal difficulties encountered by <a href="/wiki/Carter_USM" title="Carter USM" class="mw-redirect">Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine</a> when they quoted from the song "<a href="/wiki/Ruby_Tuesday_(song)" title="Ruby Tuesday (song)" class="mw-redirect">Ruby Tuesday</a>" in their song "After the Watershed" some years earlier. In both cases, the issue at stake was not the use of the recording, but the use of the song itself—the section from "The Last Time" used by the Verve was not even part of the original composition, but because it derived from a cover version of it, <a href="/wiki/Mick_Jagger" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Keith_Richards" title="Keith Richards">Keith Richards</a> were still entitled to royalties and credit on the derivative work. This illustrates an important legal point: even if a sample is used legally, it may open the artist up to other problems.</p>

<p>The most recent significant copyright case involving sampling held that even sampling three notes could constitute copyright infringement. <i><a href="/wiki/Bridgeport_Music_Inc._v._Dimension_Films" title="Bridgeport Music Inc. v. Dimension Films" class="mw-redirect">Bridgeport Music Inc. v. Dimension Films</a></i>, 410 F.3d 792 (6th Cir. 2005). This case was roundly criticised by many in the music industry, including the <a href="/wiki/RIAA" title="RIAA" class="mw-redirect">RIAA</a>.</p>
<p>There has been a second important US case on music sampling involving the <a href="/wiki/Beastie_Boys" title="Beastie Boys">Beastie Boys</a> who sampled the sound recording of a flute track by <a href="/wiki/James_Newton" title="James Newton">James Newton</a> in their song "Pass the Mic." The Beastie Boys properly obtained a license to use the sound recording but did not clear the use of the <i>song</i> (the composition on which the recording is based including any music and lyrics). In <i>Newton v. Diamond and Others</i> 349 F.3d 591 (9th Cir. 2003) the US Appeals Court held that the use of the looped sample of a flute did not constitute copyright infringement as the core of the song itself had not been used. It seems that the position in law now is that with use of the sound recording <i>any</i> use without permission will constitute an infringement; however with the composition there must be some substantial use—the 'heart' of the song itself must be at least recognizable. This extends to both the music and the lyrics; a June 2006 case involving <a href="/wiki/Ludacris" title="Ludacris">Ludacris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kanye_West" title="Kanye West">Kanye West</a> held that their use of the phrases "like that" and "straight like that" which had been used on an earlier hip-hop track by another artist was not infringing use.</p>

Both artist had used the same chant in each song, but Juvenile won the case because of the title's name change to <i>Back That Azz Up</i>, which sold 2 million copies. Because of the name change, Jubilee lacked evidence that Juvenile had stolen from him, and Jubilee could not earn Juvenile's income from his song.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Today, most mainstream acts obtain prior authorization to use samples, a process known as "clearing" (gaining permission to use the sample and, usually, paying an up-front fee and/or a cut of the royalties to the original artist). Independent bands, lacking the funds and legal assistance to clear samples, are at a disadvantage - unless they seek the services of a professional sample replay company or producer.</p>

<li>"[Samples have] a certain reality. It doesn't just take the sound, it takes the whole way it was recorded. The ambient sounds, the little bits of reverb left off crashes that happened a couple of bars ago. There's a lot of things in the sample, just like when you take a picture—it's got a lot more levels than say, the kick-drum or the drum machine, I think. [...] Looking at a sampler the way it was used first—to try and simulate real instruments—you didn't have to get a session guitarist and you could just be like, 'Hey, I can have an orchestra in my track, and I can have a guitar, and it sounds real!' And I think that's the wrong way to use sampling. The right way is to get the guitar, and go, 'Right, that's a guitar. Let's make it into something that a guitar could never possibly be.' You know, take it away from the source and try to make it something else. Might as well just get a bloody guitarist if you want a guitarist. There's plenty of them." —<a href="/wiki/Amon_Tobin" title="Amon Tobin">Amon Tobin</a> <sup>dead link, view archive <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/interviews/t/tobin_amon-00/" class="external text" title="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/interviews/t/tobin_amon-00/" rel="nofollow">here</a></sup></li>

<li>"A lot of people still don't recognize the sampler as a musical instrument. I can see why. A lot of rap hits over the years used the sampler more like a <a href="/wiki/Xerox" title="Xerox">Xerox</a> machine. If you take four whole bars that are identifiable, you're just biting that shit. But I've always been into using the sampler more like a painter's palette than a Xerox. Then again, I might use it as a Xerox if I find rare beats that nobody had in their crates yet. If I find a certain sample that's just incredible—like the one on '<a href="/wiki/Liquid_Swords" title="Liquid Swords">Liquid Swords</a>'—I have to zap that! That was from an old <a href="/wiki/Willie_Mitchell_(musician)" title="Willie Mitchell (musician)">Willie Mitchell</a> song that I was pretty sure most people didn't have.

<li>"It's a context issue, because not every sample is a huge chunk of a song. We might take a tiny little insignificant sound from a record and then slow it way down and put it deep in the mix with, like, 30 other sounds on top of it. It's not even a recognizable sample at that point. Which is a lot different from taking a huge, obvious piece from some hit song that everyone knows and saying whatever you want to on top of that loop. An example that's often brought up in court when we get sued over sampling is a <a href="/wiki/Biz_Markie" title="Biz Markie">Biz Markie</a> track where he more or less used a whole <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_O%27Sullivan" title="Gilbert O'Sullivan">Gilbert O'Sullivan</a> song.

<li>"It's pretty much impossible to clear samples now [in 2005]. We had to stay away from samples as much as possible. The ones that we did use were just absolutely integral to the feeling or rhythm of the song. But, back [on <i><a href="/wiki/Odelay" title="Odelay">Odelay</a></i>] it was basically me writing chord changes and melodies and stuff, and then endless records being scratched and little sounds coming off the turntable. Now it's prohibitively difficult and expensive to justify your one weird little horn blare that happens for half of a second one time in a song and makes you give away 70 percent of the song and $50,000.

<p>Once recorded, samples can be edited, played back, or looped (i.e. played back continuously). Types of samples include:</p>
<p><a name="Loops" id="Loops"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Sampling_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Loops">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Loops</span></h3>
<p>The drums and percussion parts of many modern recordings are really a variety of short samples of beats strung together. Many libraries of such beats exist and are licensed so that the user incorporating the samples can distribute their recording without paying royalties. Such libraries can be loaded into samplers. Though percussion is a typical application of looping, many kinds of samples can be looped. A piece of music may have an <a href="/wiki/Ostinato" title="Ostinato">ostinato</a> which is created by sampling a phrase played on any kind of instrument. There is software which specializes in creating loops.</p>
<p><a name="Samples_of_musical_instruments" id="Samples_of_musical_instruments"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Sampling_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Samples of musical instruments">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Samples of musical instruments</span></h3>
<p>Whereas loops are usually a phrase played on a musical instrument, this type of sample is usually a single note. <a href="/wiki/Music_workstation" title="Music workstation">Music workstations</a> and samplers use samples of musical instruments as the basis of their own sounds, and are capable of playing a sample back at any pitch. Many modern <a href="/wiki/Synthesizer" title="Synthesizer">synthesizers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Drum_machine" title="Drum machine">drum machines</a> also use samples as the basis of their sounds. (See <a href="/wiki/Sample-based_synthesis" title="Sample-based synthesis">sample-based synthesis</a> for more information.) Most such samples are created in professional recording studios using world-class instruments played by accomplished musicians. These are usually developed by the manufacturer of the instrument or by a subcontractor who specializes in creating such samples. There are businesses and individuals who create libraries of samples of musical instruments. Of course, a sampler allows anyone to create such samples.</p>
<p>Possibly the earliest equipment used to sample recorded instrument sounds are the <a href="/wiki/Chamberlin" title="Chamberlin">Chamberlin</a>, which was developed in the 1940s, and its more well-known cousin, the <a href="/wiki/Mellotron" title="Mellotron">Mellotron</a>, marketed in England in the 1960s. Both are <a href="/w/index.php?title=Tape_replay_keyboards&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tape replay keyboards (page does not exist)">tape replay keyboards</a>, in which each key pressed triggers a prerecorded tape loop of a single note.</p>
<p>Musicians can reproduce the same samples of break beats like the <a href="/wiki/Amen_break" title="Amen break">"Amen" break</a> which was composed, produced and mastered by the <a href="/wiki/The_Winstons" title="The Winstons">Winston Brothers</a> in 1960s. Producers in the early 90's have used the whole 5.66 second sample; but music workstations like the <a href="/wiki/Korg" title="Korg">Korg</a> Electribe Series (EM-1, ES-1; EMX-1 and the ESX-1) have used the "Amen" kick, hi hat and snare in their sound wave libraries for free use. Sampler production companies have managed to use these samples for pitch, attack and decay and DSP effects to each drum sound. These features allow producers to manipulate samples to match other parts of the composition.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Most sample sets consist of multiple samples at different pitches. These are combined into <a href="/wiki/Keymap" title="Keymap" class="mw-redirect">keymaps</a>, that associate each sample with a particular pitch or pitch range. Often, these sample maps may have different layers as well, so that different velocities can trigger a different sample.</p>
<p>Samples used in musical instruments sometimes have a looped component. An instrument with indefinite sustain, such as a pipe organ, does not need to be represented by a very long sample because the sustained portion of the timbre is looped. The sampler (or other sample playback instrument) plays the attack and decay portion of the sample followed by the looped sustain portion for as long as the note is held, then plays the release portion of the sample.</p>
<p>A common standard format for generating such sample sets is the <a href="/wiki/Soundfont" title="Soundfont" class="mw-redirect">soundfont</a> protocol.</p>

<p>To conserve <a href="/wiki/Polyphony" title="Polyphony">polyphony</a>, a workstation may allow the user to sample a layer of sounds (piano, strings, and voices, for example) so they can be played together as one sound instead of three. This leaves more of the instruments' resources available to generate additional sounds.</p>

<p>There are several genres of music in which it is commonplace for an artist to sample a phrase of a well-known recording and use it as an element in a new composition. Two well-known examples include the sample of <a href="/wiki/Rick_James" title="Rick James">Rick James</a>' "<a href="/wiki/Super_Freak" title="Super Freak">Super Freak</a>" in <a href="/wiki/MC_Hammer" title="MC Hammer">MC Hammer</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/U_Can%27t_Touch_This" title="U Can't Touch This">U Can't Touch This</a>" and the sample of <a href="/wiki/Queen_(band)" title="Queen (band)">Queen</a>/<a href="/wiki/David_Bowie" title="David Bowie">David Bowie</a>'s "<a href="/wiki/Under_Pressure" title="Under Pressure">Under Pressure</a>" in <a href="/wiki/Vanilla_Ice" title="Vanilla Ice">Vanilla Ice</a>'s "Ice Ice Baby".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Sampling_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13" title="Edit section: Samples of spoken word">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Samples of spoken word</span></h3>
<p>Usually taken from movies, television, or other non-musical media, often used to create atmosphere, to set a mood, or even comic effect. The American composer <a href="/wiki/Steve_Reich" title="Steve Reich">Steve Reich</a> used samples from interviews with <a href="/wiki/Holocaust_survivors" title="Holocaust survivors" class="mw-redirect">Holocaust survivors</a> as a source for the melodies on the 1988 album <a href="/wiki/Different_Trains" title="Different Trains">Different Trains</a>, performed by the <a href="/wiki/Kronos_Quartet" title="Kronos Quartet">Kronos Quartet</a>.</p>
<p>Many genres utilize sampling of spoken word to induce a mood, and <a href="/wiki/Goa_trance" title="Goa trance">Goa trance</a> often employs samples of people speaking about the use of<a href="/w/index.php?title=Psychoactives&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Psychoactives (page does not exist)">psychoactives</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spirituality" title="Spirituality">spirituality</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> themes. Industrial is known for samples from horror/sci-fi movies, news broadcasts, propaganda reels, and speeches by political figures. The band <a href="/wiki/Ministry_(band)" title="Ministry (band)">Ministry</a> frequently samples George Bush. <a href="/wiki/Paul_Hardcastle" title="Paul Hardcastle">Paul Hardcastle</a> used recordings of a news reporter, as well as a soldier and ambient noise of a protest, in his single "Nineteen," a song about Vietnam war veterans and <a href="/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder" title="Posttraumatic stress disorder">Posttraumatic stress disorder</a>. The band <a href="/wiki/Negativland" title="Negativland">Negativland</a> samples from practically every form of popular media, ranging from infomercials to children's records. In the song "Civil War", <a href="/wiki/Guns_N%27_Roses" title="Guns N' Roses">Guns N' Roses</a> samples from the 1967 film <a href="/wiki/Cool_Hand_Luke" title="Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand Luke</a>, on the album <a href="/wiki/Use_Your_Illusion_II" title="Use Your Illusion II">Use Your Illusion II</a>. Other bands that frequently used samples in their work are <a href="/wiki/Noise_rock" title="Noise rock">noise rockers</a> <a href="/wiki/Steel_Pole_Bath_Tub" title="Steel Pole Bath Tub">Steel Pole Bath Tub</a> and <a href="/wiki/Death_metal" title="Death metal">death metal</a> band <a href="/wiki/Skinless" title="Skinless">Skinless</a>.</p>

<p>These are not musical in the conventional sense - that is, neither percussive nor melodic - but which are musically useful for their interesting timbres or emotional associations, in the spirit of <a href="/wiki/Musique_concrete" title="Musique concrete" class="mw-redirect">musique concrete</a>. Some common examples include sirens and klaxons, locomotive whistles, gunshots, natural sounds such as whale song, and cooing babies. It is common in theatrical <a href="/wiki/Sound_design" title="Sound design">sound design</a> to use this type of sampling to store sound effects that can then be triggered from a musical keyboard or other software. This is very useful for high precision or nonlinear requirements.</p>
<p><a name="Sample_Clearance_Services" id="Sample_Clearance_Services"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Sampling_(music)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Edit section: Sample Clearance Services">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sample Clearance Services</span></h3>
<p>Similar to companies that obtain mechanical licenses for licensees who wish to use musical compositions to make new sound recordings, sample clearance services obtain licenses to clear the rights involved with using a sample. Clearance services can obtain sample license offers on behalf of independent artists and producers who utilize samples in their "new works," or on behalf of record labels who plan to distribute their "new works." "New work" refers to the new musical composition and sound recording which utilizes a sample from another work. Note that a music sample contains two separate copyrighted works. One is the original sound recording, and the other is the underlying musical composition.</p>
<p>Sample clearance companies can be a very cost effective way to clear samples, because it costs much more to hire an entertainment attorney to perform similar services. However, it is important to know that a sample clearance service is no replacement for a competent entertainment attorney with the additional ability to provide legal advice. Clearance services cannot perform this function unless run by an attorney.</p>
<p>Remember that sample clearance is a very important part of making an album containing samples a legally viable product. "Without proper clearance, the owners of the original work you sampled can sue for large sums of money or prevent distribution of your album."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> It is important to recognize that "one sample may consist of 2 clearances (ie one master clearance &amp; one publishing clearance)."<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Often, sample clearance services are run by people with extensive experience in the music publishing industry or business affairs departments at record labels. Their prior experiences allow them to efficiently navigate the system, locate the rights holders and obtain proper sample license offers. However, an entertainment attorney is a must when tackling deeper issues involving legal advice that creators of "new works" may have never anticipated.</p>

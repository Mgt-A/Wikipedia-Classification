<p>Leon Trotsky was born Lev Davidovich Bronstein (alternative English spelling: Bronshtein) nickname: Lyova on November 7, 1879, in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bereslavka&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bereslavka (page does not exist)">Yanovka</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kherson_Province" title="Kherson Province">Kherson Province</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> (today's <a href="/wiki/Kirovohrad_Oblast" title="Kirovohrad Oblast">Kirovohrad Oblast</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>), a small village 15&#160;miles (24&#160;km) from the nearest post office. He was the fifth child of a well-to-do farmer, David Leontyevich Bronstein (1847–1922) and Anna Bronstein (d. 1910). Although the family was of Jewish descent, it was not religious, and the languages spoken at home were <a href="/wiki/Russian_language" title="Russian language">Russian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_language" title="Ukrainian language">Ukrainian</a> instead of <a href="/wiki/Yiddish_language" title="Yiddish language">Yiddish</a>. Trotsky's younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Olga_Kameneva" title="Olga Kameneva">Olga</a>, married <a href="/wiki/Lev_Kamenev" title="Lev Kamenev">Lev Kamenev</a>, a leading Bolshevik.</p>
<p>When Trotsky was nine, his father sent him to <a href="/wiki/Odessa" title="Odessa">Odessa</a> to be educated and he was enrolled in a historically <a href="/wiki/German_people" title="German people" class="mw-redirect">German</a> school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa, consequent to the Imperial government's policy of <a href="/wiki/Russification" title="Russification">Russification</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since June 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. As <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Deutscher" title="Isaac Deutscher">Isaac Deutscher</a> points out in his biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook.</p>
<p>Although it is stated in his autobiography "<a href="/wiki/My_Life_(Leon_Trotsky_autobiography)" title="My Life (Leon Trotsky autobiography)">My Life</a>" that he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian and Ukrainian, <a href="/wiki/Raymond_Molinier" title="Raymond Molinier">Raymond Molinier</a> wrote that Trotsky spoke fluent French.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<p>Trotsky became involved in revolutionary activities in 1896 after moving to Nikolayev (now <a href="/wiki/Mykolaiv" title="Mykolaiv">Mykolaiv</a>). At first a <i><a href="/wiki/Narodnik" title="Narodnik">narodnik</a></i> (revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Populism" title="Populism">populist</a>), he was introduced to <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> later that year and was originally opposed to it. But during periods of exile and imprisonment he gradually became a Marxist. Instead of pursuing a <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> degree, Trotsky helped organize the <a href="/w/index.php?title=South_Russian_Workers%27_Union&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="South Russian Workers' Union (page does not exist)">South Russian Workers' Union</a> in Nikolayev in early 1897. Using the name 'Lvov' <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>, he wrote and printed leaflets and proclamations, distributed revolutionary pamphlets and popularized socialist ideas among industrial workers and revolutionary students.</p>
<p>In January 1898, over 200 members of the union, including Trotsky, were arrested, and he spent the next two years in prison awaiting trial. Two months after his imprisonment, the first Congress of the newly formed <a href="/wiki/Russian_Social_Democratic_Labor_Party" title="Russian Social Democratic Labor Party" class="mw-redirect">Russian Social Democratic Labor Party</a> (RSDLP) was held, and from then on Trotsky considered himself a member of the party. While in prison, he married fellow Marxist <a href="/wiki/Aleksandra_Sokolovskaya" title="Aleksandra Sokolovskaya">Aleksandra Sokolovskaya</a>. While serving his sentence he studied philosophy. In 1900 he was sentenced to four years in exile in <a href="/wiki/Ust-Kut" title="Ust-Kut">Ust-Kut</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Verkholensk&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Verkholensk (page does not exist)">Verkholensk</a> (see <a href="http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/?country=241_690_8&amp;language=1" class="external text" title="http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/?country=241_690_8&amp;language=1" rel="nofollow">map</a>) in the <a href="/wiki/Irkutsk" title="Irkutsk">Irkutsk</a> region of <a href="/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>, where his first two daughters, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Nina_Nevelson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nina Nevelson (page does not exist)">Nina Nevelson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Zinaida_Volkova" title="Zinaida Volkova">Zinaida Volkova</a>, were born.</p>
<p>In Siberia, Trotsky became aware of the differences within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known as "economists" argued that the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot in life. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter were led by the <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>-based newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/Iskra" title="Iskra">Iskra</a></i>, which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the <i>Iskra</i> position.</p>

<p>Trotsky escaped from Siberia in the summer of <a href="/wiki/1902" title="1902">1902</a>. It is said he adopted the name of a jailer of the Odessa prison in which he had earlier been held<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>, and this became his primary revolutionary pseudonym. Once abroad, he moved to London to join <a href="/wiki/Georgy_Plekhanov" title="Georgy Plekhanov" class="mw-redirect">Georgy Plekhanov</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Julius_Martov" title="Julius Martov">Julius Martov</a> and other editors of <i><a href="/wiki/Iskra" title="Iskra">Iskra</a></i>. Under the <a href="/wiki/Pen_name" title="Pen name">pen name</a> <i>Pero</i> ("feather" or "pen" in Russian), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading authors.</p>
<p>Unknown to Trotsky, the six editors of <i>Iskra</i> were evenly split between the "old guard" led by Plekhanov and the "new guard" led by Lenin and Martov. Not only were Plekhanov's supporters older (in their 40s and 50s), but they had also spent the previous 20 years in European exile together. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently come from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within <i>Iskra</i>, expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard and wrote in March 1903:<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I suggest to all the members of the editorial board that they co-opt 'Pero' as a member of the board on the same basis as other members. [...] We very much need a seventh member, both as a convenience in voting (six being an even number), and as an addition to our forces. 'Pero' has been contributing to every issue for several months now; he works in general most energetically for the Iskra; he gives lectures (in which he has been very successful). In the section of articles and notes on the events of the day, he will not only be very useful, but absolutely necessary. Unquestionably a man of rare abilities, he has conviction and energy, and he will go much farther.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to Plekhanov's opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board, but from then on participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.</p>
<p>In late 1902, Trotsky met <a href="/wiki/Natalia_Sedova" title="Natalia Sedova">Natalia Sedova</a>, who soon became his companion and, from 1903 until his death, his wife. They had two children together, <a href="/wiki/Lev_Sedov" title="Lev Sedov">Lev Sedov</a> (b. 1906) and <a href="/wiki/Sergei_Sedov" title="Sergei Sedov">Sergei Sedov</a> (b. 1908). As Trotsky later explained,<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> after the 1917 revolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In order not to oblige my sons to change their name, I, for "citizenship" requirements, took on the name of my wife.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the name change remained a technicality and he never used the name "Sedov" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name "Sedova-Trotskaya". Trotsky and his first wife, Aleksandra Sokolovskaya, maintained a friendly relationship until she disappeared in 1935 during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Purges" title="Great Purges" class="mw-redirect">Great Purges</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the first party Congress in 1898, <i>Iskra</i> succeeded in convening the party's 2nd congress in London in August 1903, Trotsky and other <i>Iskra</i> editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with <i>Iskra</i> supporters handily defeating the few "economist" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the <a href="/wiki/Jewish_Bund" title="Jewish Bund" class="mw-redirect">Jewish Bund</a>, which had co-founded the RSDLP in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party. In the heat of the debate, Trotsky made a controversial statement to the effect that he and eleven other non-Bund <a href="/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish" class="mw-redirect">Jewish</a> delegates who had signed an anti-Bund statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>while working in the Russian party, regarded and still do regard themselves also as representatives of the Jewish proletariat.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trotsky claimed his statement was a tactical maneuver made on Lenin's request.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, pro-<i>Iskra</i> delegates unexpectedly split into two factions. Lenin and his supporters (known as "<a href="/wiki/Bolsheviks" title="Bolsheviks" class="mw-redirect">Bolsheviks</a>") argued for a smaller but highly organized party. Martov and his supporters (known as "<a href="/wiki/Mensheviks" title="Mensheviks" class="mw-redirect">Mensheviks</a>") argued for a larger and less disciplined party. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the <i>Iskra</i> editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks. From then until 1917 he described himself as a "non-factional social democrat".</p>
<p>Trotsky spent much of his time between 1904 and 1917 trying to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later conceded he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. During these years Trotsky began developing his theory of <a href="/wiki/Permanent_revolution" title="Permanent revolution">permanent revolution</a>, which led to a close working relationship with <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Parvus" title="Alexander Parvus">Alexander Parvus</a> in 1904-1907.</p>

<p>After the events of <a href="/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1905)" title="Bloody Sunday (1905)">Bloody Sunday (1905)</a>, Trotsky secretly returned to Russia in February 1905. At first he wrote leaflets for an underground printing press in <a href="/wiki/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, but soon moved to the capital, <a href="/wiki/Saint_Petersburg" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. There he worked with both <a href="/wiki/Bolsheviks" title="Bolsheviks" class="mw-redirect">Bolsheviks</a> like Central Committee member <a href="/wiki/Leonid_Krasin" title="Leonid Krasin">Leonid Krasin</a>, and the local <a href="/wiki/Menshevik" title="Menshevik">Menshevik</a> committee which he pushed in a more radical direction. But the latter was betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural <a href="/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Finland" title="Grand Duchy of Finland">Finland</a>. There he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution until October, when a nationwide strike made it possible for him to return to St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>After returning to the capital, Trotsky and <a href="/wiki/Parvus" title="Parvus" class="mw-redirect">Parvus</a> took over the newspaper <i>Russian Gazette</i> and increased its circulation to 500,000. Trotsky also co-founded <i>Nachalo</i> ("The Beginning") with Parvus and the Mensheviks, which proved to be very successful.</p>
<p>Just before Trotsky's return, the Mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that Trotsky had -- an elected non-party revolutionary organization representing the capital's workers, the first <a href="/wiki/Soviet_(council)" title="Soviet (council)">Soviet</a> ("Council") of Workers. By the time of Trotsky's arrival, the <a href="/wiki/St._Petersburg_Soviet" title="St. Petersburg Soviet" class="mw-redirect">St. Petersburg Soviet</a> was already functioning headed by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Khrustalyov-Nosar&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Khrustalyov-Nosar (page does not exist)">Khrustalyov-Nosar</a> (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov), a compromise figure, and proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the Bolsheviks' original opposition. Trotsky joined the Soviet under the name "Yanovsky" (after the village he was born in, Yanovka) and was elected vice-Chairman. He did much of the actual work at the Soviet and, after Khrustalev-Nosar's arrest on November 26, was elected its chairman. On December 2, the Soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the Tsarist government and its foreign debts:<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The autocracy never enjoyed the confidence of the people and was never granted any authority by the people. We have therefore decided not to allow the repayment of such loans as have been made by the Tsarist government when openly engaged in a war with the entire people.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following day, December 3, the Soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested.</p>
<p>Trotsky and other Soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion. At the trial, Trotsky delivered some of the best speeches of his life and solidified his reputation as an effective public speaker, which he confirmed in 1917-1920.

<p>En route to deportation to Siberia in January 1907, Trotsky escaped and once again made his way to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, where he attended the 5th Congress of the <a href="/wiki/RSDLP" title="RSDLP" class="mw-redirect">RSDLP</a>. In October, he moved to <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> where he often took part in the activities of the <a href="/wiki/Austrian_Social_Democratic_Party" title="Austrian Social Democratic Party" class="mw-redirect">Austrian Social Democratic Party</a> and, occasionally, of the <a href="/wiki/German_Social_Democratic_Party" title="German Social Democratic Party" class="mw-redirect">German Social Democratic Party</a>, for seven years.</p>
<p>In Vienna, Trotsky became close to <a href="/wiki/Adolph_Joffe" title="Adolph Joffe">Adolph Joffe</a>, his friend for the next 20 years, who introduced him to psychoanalysis.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> In October 1908 he started a bi-weekly Russian language Social Democratic paper aimed at Russian workers called <i><a href="/wiki/Pravda" title="Pravda">Pravda</a></i> ("Truth"), which he co-edited with Joffe, <a href="/wiki/Matvey_Skobelev" title="Matvey Skobelev">Matvey Skobelev</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Victor_Kopp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Victor Kopp (page does not exist)">Victor Kopp</a> and which was smuggled into Russia. The paper avoided factional politics and proved popular with Russian industrial workers. Both the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 1905-1907 revolution. When various Bolshevik and Menshevik factions tried to re-unite at the January 1910 RSDLP Central Committee meeting in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> over Lenin's objections, Trotsky's <i>Pravda</i> was made a party-financed 'central organ'. <a href="/wiki/Lev_Kamenev" title="Lev Kamenev">Lev Kamenev</a>, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910 when Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations. Trotsky continued publishing <i>Pravda</i> for another two years until it finally folded in April 1912.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks started a new workers-oriented newspaper in St. Petersburg on April 22, 1912, and also called it <i>Pravda</i>. Trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913 he wrote a letter to <a href="/wiki/Nikolay_Chkheidze" title="Nikolay Chkheidze">Nikolay Chkheidze</a>, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the letter was intercepted by the police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was pulled out of the archives and made public by his opponents within the Communist Party, and was used to paint him as Lenin's enemy.</p>
<p>This was a period of heightened tension within the RSDLP and led to numerous frictions between Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The most serious disagreement that Trotsky and the Mensheviks had with Lenin at the time was over the issue of "expropriations",<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> i.e. armed robberies of banks and other companies by Bolshevik groups to procure money for the Party, which had been banned by the 5th Congress, but continued by the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>In January 1912, the majority of the Bolshevik faction led by Lenin and a few Mensheviks held a conference in <a href="/wiki/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a> and expelled their opponents from the party. In response, Trotsky organized a "unification" conference of social democratic factions in Vienna in August 1912 (a.k.a. "The August Bloc") and tried to re-unite the party. The attempt was generally unsuccessful.</p>
<p>In Vienna, Trotsky continuously published articles in radical Russian and Ukrainian newspapers like <i>Kievskaya Mysl</i> under a variety of pseudonyms, often "Antid Oto". In September 1912 <i>Kievskaya Mysl</i> sent him to the Balkans as its war correspondent, where he covered the two <a href="/wiki/Balkan_Wars" title="Balkan Wars">Balkan Wars</a> for the next year and became a close friend of <a href="/wiki/Christian_Rakovsky" title="Christian Rakovsky">Christian Rakovsky</a>, later a leading Soviet politician and Trotsky's ally in the Soviet Communist Party.</p>
<p>On August 3, 1914, at the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> which pitted Austria-Hungary against the Russian empire, Trotsky was forced to flee Vienna for neutral <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> to avoid arrest as a Russian <a href="/wiki/%C3%89migr%C3%A9" title="Émigré">émigré</a>.</p>

<p>The outbreak of WWI caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other European social democratic parties over the issues of war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions, while Plekhanov and other social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, Trotsky briefly worked within the <a href="/wiki/Swiss_Socialist_Party" title="Swiss Socialist Party" class="mw-redirect">Swiss Socialist Party</a>, prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution, and wrote a book against the war, <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1914-war/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1914-war/index.htm" rel="nofollow"><i>The War and the International</i></a>.

<p>Trotsky moved to France on November 19, 1914, as a war correspondent for the <i>Kievskaya Mysl</i>. In January 1915 he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the Left) <i>Nashe Slovo</i> ("Our Word"), an internationalist socialist newspaper, in Paris. He adopted the slogan of "peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered", which didn't go quite as far as Lenin, who advocated Russia's defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the <a href="/wiki/Second_International" title="Second International">Second International</a>.</p>
<p>Trotsky attended the <a href="/wiki/Zimmerwald_Conference" title="Zimmerwald Conference">Zimmerwald Conference</a> of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a <a href="/wiki/Third_International" title="Third International" class="mw-redirect">Third International</a>. The conference adopted the middle line proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed to it, in the end Lenin voted<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> for Trotsky's resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.</p>
<p>In March 31, Trotsky was deported from France to <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> for his anti-war activities. Spanish authorities did not let him stay and he was deported to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> on December 25, 1916. He arrived in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> on January 13, 1917. In New York, he wrote articles for the local Russian language socialist newspaper <i><a href="/wiki/Novy_Mir_(New_York)" title="Novy Mir (New York)" class="mw-redirect">Novy Mir</a></i> and the Yiddish language daily <a href="/wiki/The_Forward" title="The Forward">Der Forverts (The Forward)</a> in translation and made speeches to Russian émigrés.</p>
<p>Trotsky was living in New York City when the <a href="/wiki/February_Revolution" title="February Revolution">February Revolution</a> of 1917 overthrew <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia" title="Nicholas II of Russia">Tsar Nicholas II</a>. He left New York on March 27, but his ship was intercepted by <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> naval officials in <a href="/wiki/City_of_Halifax" title="City of Halifax">Halifax</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nova_Scotia" title="Nova Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> and he spent a month detained at <a href="/wiki/Amherst,_Nova_Scotia" title="Amherst, Nova Scotia">Amherst, Nova Scotia</a>. After initial hesitation, the Russian foreign minister <a href="/wiki/Pavel_Milyukov" title="Pavel Milyukov">Pavel Milyukov</a> was forced to demand that Trotsky be released, and the British government freed Trotsky on April 29. He finally made his way back to Russia on May 4.</p>
<p>Upon his return, Trotsky was in substantive agreement with the <a href="/wiki/Bolshevik" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least 6 groups and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the <a href="/wiki/Mezhraiontsy" title="Mezhraiontsy">Mezhraiontsy</a>, a regional social democratic organization in St. Petersburg, and became one of its leaders. At the First <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Soviets" title="Congress of Soviets">Congress of Soviets</a> in June, he was elected a member of the first <a href="/wiki/All-Russian_Central_Executive_Committee" title="All-Russian Central Executive Committee">All-Russian Central Executive Committee</a> ("VTsIK") from the Mezhraiontsy faction.</p>
<p>After an unsuccessful pro-Bolshevik uprising in Petrograd, Trotsky was arrested on August 7, 1917, but was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counter-revolutionary <a href="/wiki/Kornilov_Affair" title="Kornilov Affair" class="mw-redirect">uprising by Lavr Kornilov</a>. After the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the <a href="/wiki/Petrograd_Soviet" title="Petrograd Soviet">Petrograd Soviet</a>, Trotsky was elected Chairman on October 8.

Leon Trotsky, 1918</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The following summary of Trotsky's Role in 1917 was written by Stalin in <i>Pravda</i>, November 10, 1918. (Although this passage was quoted in Stalin's book "The October Revolution" issued in 1934, it was expunged in Stalin's Works released in 1949.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>All practical work in connection with the organization of the uprising was done under the immediate direction of Comrade Trotsky, the President of the Petrograd Soviet. It can be stated with certainty that the Party is indebted primarily and principally to Comrade Trotsky for the rapid going over of the garrison to the side of the Soviet and the efficient manner in which the work of the <a href="/wiki/Military_Revolutionary_Committee" title="Military Revolutionary Committee">Military Revolutionary Committee</a> was organized.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the success of the uprising on 7-November 8, Trotsky led the efforts to repel a <a href="/wiki/Kerensky-Krasnov_uprising" title="Kerensky-Krasnov uprising">counter-attack</a> by <a href="/wiki/Cossacks" title="Cossacks">Cossacks</a> under General <a href="/wiki/Pyotr_Krasnov" title="Pyotr Krasnov">Pyotr Krasnov</a> and other troops still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government at <a href="/wiki/Gatchina" title="Gatchina">Gatchina</a>. Allied with Lenin, he successfully defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, <a href="/wiki/Alexei_Rykov" title="Alexei Rykov">Alexei Rykov</a>, etc) to share power with other socialist parties.</p>
<p>By the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin, overshadowing the ambitious Zinoviev, who had been Lenin's top lieutenant over the previous decade, but whose star appeared to be fading. This turnaround led to enmity between the two Bolshevik leaders which lasted until 1926 and did much to destroy them both.</p>

<p>After the Bolsheviks came to power, Trotsky became the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Commissar" title="People's Commissar" class="mw-redirect">People's Commissar</a> for Foreign Affairs and published the secret treaties previously signed by the <a href="/wiki/Triple_Entente" title="Triple Entente">Triple Entente</a> that detailed plans for post-war reallocation of colonies and redrawing state borders.</p>
<p>Trotsky led the Soviet delegation during the peace negotiations in <a href="/wiki/Brest-Litovsk" title="Brest-Litovsk" class="mw-redirect">Brest-Litovsk</a> from December 22, 1917 to February 10, 1918.

They cited the successes of the newly formed (January 15, 1918) voluntary <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a> against Polish forces of Gen. <a href="/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Dowbor-Mu%C5%9Bnicki" title="Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki">Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki</a> in <a href="/wiki/Belarus" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="/wiki/White_movement" title="White movement">White</a> forces in the <a href="/wiki/Don_River,_Russia" title="Don River, Russia" class="mw-redirect">Don</a> region, and newly independent <a href="/wiki/Ukraine" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and <a href="/wiki/Asymmetrical_warfare" title="Asymmetrical warfare" class="mw-redirect">asymmetrical warfare</a> were used.

In case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany in order to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by <a href="/wiki/Left_Socialist_Revolutionaries" title="Left Socialist Revolutionaries" class="mw-redirect">Left Socialist Revolutionaries</a>, who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.</p>

<p>Lenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum.</p>
<p>Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>That we could no longer fight was perfectly clear to me and that the newly formed <a href="/wiki/Red_Guard" title="Red Guard" class="mw-redirect">Red Guard</a> and Red Army detachments were too small and poorly trained to resist the Germans.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible moral and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this may well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked grab for territories. He wrote in 1925:<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>We began peace negotiations in the hope of arousing the workmen's party of Germany and Austria-Hungary as well as of the Entente countries. For this reason we were obliged to delay the negotiations as long as possible to give the European workman time to understand the main fact of the Soviet revolution itself and particularly its peace policy.</i></p>
<p><i>But there was the other question: Can the Germans still fight? Are they in a position to begin an attack on the revolution that will explain the cessation of the war? How can we find out the state of mind of the German soldiers, how to fathom it?</i></p>

<p>Throughout January and February 1918, Lenin's position was supported by 7 members of the Bolshevik Central Committee and Bukharin's by 4. Trotsky had 4 votes (his own, <a href="/wiki/Felix_Dzerzhinsky" title="Felix Dzerzhinsky">Felix Dzerzhinsky</a>'s, <a href="/wiki/Nikolai_Krestinsky" title="Nikolai Krestinsky">Nikolai Krestinsky</a>'s and <a href="/wiki/Adolph_Joffe" title="Adolph Joffe">Adolph Joffe</a>'s) and, since he held the balance of power, he was able to pursue his policy in Brest-Litovsk. When he could no longer delay the negotiations, he withdrew from the talks on February 10, 1918, refusing to sign on Germany's harsh terms. After a brief hiatus, the <a href="/wiki/Central_Powers" title="Central Powers">Central Powers</a> notified the Soviet government that they would no longer observe the truce after February 17. At this point Lenin again argued that the Soviet government had done all it could to explain its position to Western workers and that it was time to accept the terms. Trotsky refused to support Lenin since he was waiting to see whether German workers would rebel and whether German soldiers would refuse to follow orders.</p>
<p>Germany resumed military operations on February 18. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized and poorly led, were no match for it. In the evening of February 18, 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained and Lenin's proposal was accepted 7-4. The Soviet government sent a <a href="/wiki/Telegram" title="Telegram" class="mw-redirect">telegram</a> to the German side accepting the final Brest-Litovsk peace terms.</p>
<p>Germany did not respond for three days, and continued its offensive encountering little resistance. The response arrived on February 21, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7-4 on February 23, 1918; the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk" title="Treaty of Brest-Litovsk">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> was signed on March 3 and ratified on March 15, 1918. Since he was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, Trotsky resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs in order to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.</p>

<p>The failure of the recently formed Red Army to resist the German offensive in February 1918 revealed its weaknesses: insufficient numbers, lack of knowledgeable officers, and near absence of coordination and subordination. Celebrated and feared <a href="/wiki/Baltic_Fleet" title="Baltic Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a> sailors, one of the bastions of the new regime led by <a href="/wiki/Pavel_Dybenko" title="Pavel Dybenko">Pavel Dybenko</a>, shamefully fled from the German army at <a href="/wiki/Narva" title="Narva">Narva</a>. The notion that the Soviet state could have an effective voluntary or <a href="/wiki/Militia" title="Militia">militia</a> type military was seriously undermined.</p>
<p>Trotsky was one of the first Bolshevik leaders to recognize the problem and he pushed for the formation of a military council of former Russian generals that would function as an advisory body. Lenin and the Bolshevik Central Committee agreed on March 4 to create the <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Military_Council" title="Supreme Military Council">Supreme Military Council</a>, headed by former chief of the imperial General Staff <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Bonch-Bruevich" title="Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich">Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich</a>. But the entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People's Commissar (defense minister) <a href="/wiki/Nikolai_Podvoisky" title="Nikolai Podvoisky">Nikolai Podvoisky</a> and commander-in-chief <a href="/wiki/Nikolai_Krylenko" title="Nikolai Krylenko">Nikolai Krylenko</a>, protested vigorously and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a> and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side. The discontent with Trotsky's policies of strict discipline, conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Military_Opposition&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Military Opposition (page does not exist)">Military Opposition</a>, which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918-1919.</p>
<p>On March 13, 1918 Trotsky's resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted and he was appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs - in place of Podvoisky - and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over Brest-Litovsk. With the help of his faithful deputy <a href="/wiki/Ephraim_Sklyansky" title="Ephraim Sklyansky">Ephraim Sklyansky</a>, Trotsky spent the rest of the Civil War transforming the Red Army from a ragtag network of small and fiercely independent detachments into a large and disciplined military machine, through forced conscription, party controlled blocking squads, compulsory obedience and officers chosen by the leadership instead of the rank and file. He defended these positions throughout his life.</p>

<p>Trotsky's managerial and organization-building skills with the Soviet military were soon tested in many ways. In May-June 1918, the <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovak_Legions" title="Czechoslovak Legions">Czechoslovak Legions</a> en route from European Russia to <a href="/wiki/Vladivostok" title="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the <a href="/wiki/White_Movement" title="White Movement" class="mw-redirect">White Army</a> after their best known component) and widespread defection by the military experts that Trotsky relied on.</p>
<p>Trotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged <a href="/wiki/Mobilization" title="Mobilization">mobilization</a>, which increased the size of the Red Army from less than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of <a href="/wiki/Political_commissar" title="Political commissar">political commissars</a> into the army. The latter were responsible for ensuring the loyalty of military experts (who were mostly former officers in the imperial army) and co-signing their orders.</p>
<p>Unlike conventional army of the bourgeoisie, the Red Army was built on the idea of the October Revolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>An army (read conventional bourgeoisie army – editor’s note) cannot be built without reprisals. Masses of men cannot be led to death unless the army command has the death-penalty in its arsenal. So long as those malicious tailless apes that are so proud of their technical achievements—the animals that we call men—will build armies and wage wars, the command will always be obliged to place the soldiers between the possible death in the front and the inevitable one in the rear. And yet armies are not built on fear. The Tsar’s army fell to pieces not because of any lack of reprisals. In his attempt to save it by restoring the death-penalty, Kerensky only finished it. Upon the ashes of the great war, the Bolsheviks created a new army. These facts demand no explanation for any one who has even the slightest knowledge of the language of history. The strongest cement in the new army was the ideas of the October revolution, and the train supplied the front with this cement.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In dealing with deserters, Trotsky often appealed to them politically; arousing them with the ideas of the Revolution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In the provinces of Kaluga, Voronezh, and Ryazan, tens of thousands of young peasants had failed to answer the first recruiting summons by the Soviets … The war commissariat of Ryazan succeeded in gathering in some fifteen thousand of such deserters. While passing through Ryazan, I decided to take a look at them. Some of our men tried to dissuade me. “Something might happen,” they warned me. But everything went off beautifully. The men were called out of their barracks. “Comrade-deserters – come to the meeting. Comrade Trotsky has come to speak to you.” They ran out excited, boisterous, as curious as schoolboys. I had imagined them much worse, and they had imagined me as more terrible. In a few minutes, I was surrounded by a huge crowd of unbridled, utterly undisciplined, but not at all hostile men. The “comrade-deserters” were looking at me with such curiosity that it seemed as if their eyes would pop out of their heads. I climbed on a table there in the yard, and spoke to them for about an hour and a half. It was a most responsive audience. I tried to raise them in their own eyes; concluding, I asked them to lift their hands in token of their loyalty to the revolution. The new ideas infected them before my very eyes. They were genuinely enthusiastic; they followed me to the automobile, devoured me with their eyes, not fearfully, as before, but rapturously, and shouted at the tops of their voices. They would hardly let me go. I learned afterward, with some pride, that one of the best ways to educate them was to remind them: “What did you promise Comrade Trotsky?” Later on, regiments of Ryazan “deserters” fought well at the fronts.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the lack of man power and the invading 16 foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted that former <a href="/wiki/Tsar" title="Tsar">Tsar</a> officers should be used as military specialists within the Red Army, with a combination of Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>When Comrade Trotsky recently informed me that in our military department the officers are numbered in tens of thousands, I gained a concrete conception of what constitutes the secret of making proper use of our enemy ... of how to build communism out of the bricks that the capitalists had gathered to use against us.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In September 1918, the government, facing continuous military difficulties, declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the <a href="/wiki/Latvian_Riflemen" title="Latvian Riflemen">Red Latvian Rifleman</a> <a href="/wiki/Ioakim_Vatsetis" title="Ioakim Vatsetis" class="mw-redirect">Ioakim Vatsetis</a> (aka Jukums Vācietis), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis was put in charge of day-to-day operations of the army while Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary_Military_Council" title="Revolutionary Military Council">Revolutionary Military Council</a> of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918 while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.</p>
<p>The reorganization caused yet another conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general <a href="/w/index.php?title=Pavel_Sytin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pavel Sytin (page does not exist)">Pavel Sytin</a> to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so was recalled from the front. Lenin and <a href="/wiki/Yakov_Sverdlov" title="Yakov Sverdlov">Yakov Sverdlov</a> tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting was unsuccessful.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Leon_Trotsky&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14" title="Edit section: 1919">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1919</span></h4>
<p>Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky's leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the VIIIth Party Congress in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first <a href="/wiki/Politburo" title="Politburo">Politburo</a> after the Congress. But he later wrote:<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>It is no wonder that my military work created so many enemies for me. I did not look to the side, I elbowed away those who interfered with military success, or in the haste of the work trod on the toes of the unheeding and was too busy even to apologize. Some people remember such things. The dissatisfied and those whose feelings had been hurt found their way to Stalin or Zinoviev, for these two also nourished hurts.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In mid-1919 the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky's leadership. The Red Army had defeated the White Army's spring offensive in the east and was about to cross the <a href="/wiki/Ural" title="Ural">Ural</a> mountains and enter Siberia in pursuit of Admiral <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Kolchak" title="Alexander Kolchak" class="mw-redirect">Alexander Kolchak</a>'s forces. But in the south, General <a href="/wiki/Anton_Denikin" title="Anton Denikin">Anton Denikin</a>'s White Russian forces advanced, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. On June 6 commander-in-chief Vatsetis ordered the Eastern Front to stop the offensive so that he could use its forces in the south. But the leadership of the Eastern Front, including its commander Sergei Kamenev (a colonel in the imperial army, not to be confused with the Politburo member Lev Kamenev), and Eastern Front Revolutionary Military Council members <a href="/wiki/Ivar_Smilga" title="Ivar Smilga">Ivar Smilga</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Mikhail_Lashevich&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Mikhail Lashevich (page does not exist)">Mikhail Lashevich</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sergei_Gusev" title="Sergei Gusev">Sergei Gusev</a> vigorously protested and wanted to keep emphasis on the Eastern Front. They insisted that it was vital to capture Siberia before the onset of winter and that once Kolchak's forces were broken, many more divisions would be freed up for the Southern Front. Trotsky, who had earlier had conflicts with the leadership of the Eastern Front, including a temporary removal of Kamenev in May 1919, supported Vatsetis.</p>
<p>At the 3-July 4 Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against Vatsetis and Trotsky. Trotsky's plan was rejected and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style, much of it of a personal nature. Stalin used this opportunity to pressure Lenin<sup id="cite_ref-My_Life_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-My_Life-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> to dismiss Trotsky from his post. But when, on July 5, Trotsky offered his resignation, the Politburo and the <a href="/wiki/Orgburo" title="Orgburo">Orgburo</a> of the Central Committee unanimously rejected it.</p>
<p>Yet, a number of significant changes to the leadership of the Red Army were made. Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while the work in Moscow was informally coordinated by Smilga. Most members of the bloated Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day to day operations, were relieved of their duties on July 8, while new members including Smilga were added. The same day, while Trotsky was already in the south, Vatsetis was suddenly arrested by the <a href="/wiki/Cheka" title="Cheka">Cheka</a> on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergei Kamenev.</p>
<p>After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and <a href="/wiki/Tukhachevsky" title="Tukhachevsky" class="mw-redirect">Tukhachevsky</a> were defeated during the <a href="/wiki/Miracle_at_the_Vistula" title="Miracle at the Vistula" class="mw-redirect">Miracle at the Vistula</a>, but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and later support during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By October 1919 the government was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin's troops approached <a href="/wiki/Tula,_Russia" title="Tula, Russia">Tula</a> and Moscow from the south, and General <a href="/wiki/Nikolay_Yudenich" title="Nikolay Yudenich" class="mw-redirect">Nikolay Yudenich</a>'s troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent <a href="/wiki/Estonia" title="Estonia">Estonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Finland" title="Finland">Finland</a> from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee. He immediately went to Petrograd, whose leadership headed by Zinoviev he found demoralized, and organized its defense, sometimes personally stopping fleeing soldiers. By October 22 the Red Army was on the offensive and in early November Yudenich's troops were driven back to Estonia, where they were disarmed and interned. Trotsky was awarded the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Red_Banner" title="Order of the Red Banner">Order of the Red Banner</a> for his actions in Petrograd.</p>
<p><a name="1920" id="1920"></a></p>

<p>With the defeat of Denikin and Yudenich in late 1919, the Soviet government's emphasis shifted to economic work and Trotsky spent the winter of 1919-1920 in the Urals region trying to re-start its economy. Based on his experiences there, he proposed abandoning the policies of <a href="/wiki/War_Communism" title="War Communism" class="mw-redirect">War Communism</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. But Lenin was still committed to War Communism and the proposal was rejected. Instead, Trotsky was put in charge of the country's railroads (while retaining overall control of the Red Army), which he tried to militarize in the spirit of War Communism. It wasn't until early 1921 that economic collapse and uprisings would force Lenin and the rest of the Bolshevik leadership to abandon War Communism in favor of the <a href="/wiki/New_Economic_Policy" title="New Economic Policy">New Economic Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in early 1920 Soviet-Polish tensions eventually led to the <a href="/wiki/Polish-Soviet_War" title="Polish-Soviet War" class="mw-redirect">Polish-Soviet War</a>. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued<sup id="cite_ref-My_Life_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-My_Life-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He also did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders thought that the Red Army's successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant that, as Lenin said later:<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Red Army offensive was turned back during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Warsaw_(1920)" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a> in August 1920, in part because of Stalin's failure to obey Trotsky's orders in the run-up to the decisive engagements. Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty and this time prevailed.</p>

</div>
<p>In late 1920, after the Bolsheviks won the Civil War and before the Eighth and Ninth Congress of Soviets, the Communist Party had a heated and increasingly acrimonious debate over the role of <a href="/wiki/Trade_union" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> in the Soviet state. The discussion split the party into many "platforms" (factions), including Lenin's, Trotsky's and Bukharin's; Bukharin eventually merged his with Trotsky's. Smaller, more radical factions like the <a href="/wiki/Workers%27_Opposition" title="Workers' Opposition">Workers' Opposition</a> (headed by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Shlyapnikov" title="Alexander Shlyapnikov">Alexander Shlyapnikov</a>) and the <a href="/wiki/Group_of_Democratic_Centralism" title="Group of Democratic Centralism">Group of Democratic Centralism</a> were particularly active.</p>
<p>Trotsky's position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized "production atmosphere" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state the workers should have nothing to fear from the state, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress he argued for "such a regime under which each worker feels himself to be a soldier of labor who cannot freely dispose of himself; if he is ordered transferred, he must execute that order; if he does not do so, he will be a deserter who should be punished. Who will execute this? The trade union. It will create a new regime. That is the militarization of the working class."<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Lenin sharply criticised Trotsky and accused him of "bureaucratically nagging the trade unions" and of staging "factional attacks." His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, "Introduction of genuine labor discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions take a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. This cannot be achieved by bureaucratic methods and orders from above." This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.</p>
<p>Disagreements threatened to get out of hand and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin's and Trotsky's supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinky, <a href="/wiki/Yevgeny_Preobrazhensky" title="Yevgeny Preobrazhensky" class="mw-redirect">Yevgeny Preobrazhensky</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Leonid_Serebryakov&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Leonid Serebryakov (page does not exist)">Leonid Serebryakov</a>) supporting Trotsky.</p>
<p>At a meeting of his faction at the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921, Lenin's faction won a decisive victory and a number of Trotsky's supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky's place in the secretariat was taken by <a href="/wiki/Vyacheslav_Molotov" title="Vyacheslav Molotov">Vyacheslav Molotov</a>. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on "Party unity", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents.</p>
<p>At the end of the Tenth Congress, after peace negotiations had failed, Trotsky gave the order for the suppression of the <a href="/wiki/Kronstadt_Rebellion" title="Kronstadt Rebellion" class="mw-redirect">Kronstadt Rebellion</a>, the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Years later, <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">Anarchist</a> <a href="/wiki/Emma_Goldman" title="Emma Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> and others criticized Trotsky's actions as Commissar for War for his role in the suppression of the rebellion, and argued that he ordered unjustified incarcerations and executions of political opponents such as anarchists, although Trotsky did not participate in the actual suppression.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> The claim that the Kronstadt rebels were "counterrevolutionary" has been supported by evidence of White army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors' March rebellion.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In late 1921 Lenin's health deteriorated, he was absent from Moscow for even longer periods, and eventually had three strokes between May 26, 1922 and March 10, 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on January 21, 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin (elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee <a href="/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union" title="General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union">General Secretary</a><sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> earlier in the year), Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev <sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> formed a <i><a href="/wiki/Troika" title="Troika">troika</a></i> (triumvirate) to ensure that Trotsky, publicly the number two man in the country and Lenin's <a href="/wiki/Heir_presumptive" title="Heir presumptive">heir presumptive</a>, would not succeed Lenin.</p>
<p>The rest of the recently expanded Politburo (Rykov, <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Tomsky" title="Mikhail Tomsky">Mikhail Tomsky</a>, Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the <i>troika</i>. Stalin's power of patronage<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> in his capacity as General Secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratization of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over: much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normalcy' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.</p>
<p>Although the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the <i>troika</i> nominated Trotsky to head second rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>) and then, when Trotsky predictably refused, tried using it as an excuse to oust him.</p>
<p>When, in mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that "(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard", Lenin was shocked and responded:<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Throwing Trotsky overboard - surely you are hinting at that, it is impossible to interpret it otherwise - is the height of stupidity. If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that????</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in <a href="/wiki/Lenin%27s_Testament" title="Lenin's Testament">Lenin's Testament</a>. As part of this effort, on September 11, 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the <a href="/wiki/Sovnarkom" title="Sovnarkom" class="mw-redirect">Sovnarkom</a>. The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky "categorically refused".<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In late 1922, Lenin's relationship with Stalin deteriorated over Stalin's heavy-handed and <a href="/wiki/Chauvinism" title="Chauvinism">chauvinistic</a> handling of the issue of merging Soviet republics into one federal state, the <a href="/wiki/USSR" title="USSR" class="mw-redirect">USSR</a>. At that point, according to Trotsky's autobiography,<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Lenin offered Trotsky an alliance against Soviet bureaucracy in general and Stalin in particular. The alliance proved effective on the issue of foreign trade <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup>, but it was complicated by Lenin's progressing illness. In January 1923 the relationship between Lenin and Stalin completely broke down when Stalin rudely insulted Lenin's wife, <a href="/wiki/Nadezhda_Krupskaya" title="Nadezhda Krupskaya">Nadezhda Krupskaya</a>. At that point Lenin amended his Testament suggesting that Stalin should be replaced as the party's General Secretary, although the thrust of his argument was somewhat weakened by the fact that he also mildly criticized other Bolshevik leaders, including Trotsky. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin prepared a frontal assault on Stalin's "Great-Russian nationalistic campaign" against the <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(country)" title="Georgia (country)">Georgian</a> Communist Party (the so-called <a href="/wiki/Georgian_Affair" title="Georgian Affair">Georgian Affair</a>) and asked Trotsky to deliver the blow at the XIIth Party Congress. With Lenin no longer active, Trotsky did not raise the issue at the Congress.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>At the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, just after Lenin's final stroke, the key Central Committee reports on organizational and nationalities questions were delivered by Stalin and not by Trotsky, while Zinoviev delivered the political report of the Central Committee, traditionally Lenin's prerogative.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup> Stalin's power of appointment had allowed him to gradually replace local party secretaries with loyal functionaries and thus control most regional delegations at the congress, which enabled him to pack the Central Committee with his supporters, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev's backers.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>At the congress, Trotsky made a speech about intra-party democracy, among other things, but avoided a direct confrontation with the <i>troika</i>. The delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a <a href="/wiki/Standing_ovation" title="Standing ovation">standing ovation</a>, which couldn't help but upset the <i>troika</i>. The <i>troika</i> was further infuriated by <a href="/wiki/Karl_Radek" title="Karl Radek">Karl Radek</a>'s article <i>Leon Trotsky — Organizer of Victory</i> <sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> published in <i><a href="/wiki/Pravda" title="Pravda">Pravda</a></i> on March 14, 1923, which seemed to anoint Trotsky as Lenin's successor.</p>
<p>The resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress called, in general terms, for greater democracy within the Party, but were vague and remained unimplemented. In an important test of strength in mid-1923, the <i>troika</i> was able to neutralize Trotsky's friend and supporter <a href="/wiki/Christian_Rakovsky" title="Christian Rakovsky">Christian Rakovsky</a> by removing him from his post as head of the Ukrainian government (<i>Sovnarkom</i>) and sending him to London as Soviet ambassador. When regional Party secretaries in Ukraine protested against Rakovsky's reassignment, they too were reassigned to various posts all over the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Starting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Workers%27_Truth&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Workers' Truth (page does not exist)">Workers' Truth</a></i> and <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Workers%27_Group&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Workers' Group (page does not exist)">Workers' Group</a></i>, were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. Then, in September-October, the much anticipated <a href="/wiki/German_Revolution" title="German Revolution" class="mw-redirect">Communist revolution in Germany</a> ended in defeat.</p>
<p>On October 8, 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the <a href="/wiki/Central_Control_Commission" title="Central Control Commission" class="mw-redirect">Central Control Commission</a>, attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>In the fiercest moment of War Communism, the system of appointment within the party did not have one tenth of the extent that it has now. Appointment of the secretaries of provincial committees is now the rule. That creates for the secretary a position essentially independent of the local organization. [...] The bureaucratization of the party apparatus has developed to unheard-of proportions by means of the method of secretarial selection. There has been created a very broad stratum of party workers, entering into the apparatus of the government of the party, who completely renounce their own party opinion, at least the open expression of it, as though assuming that the secretarial hierarchy is the apparatus which creates party opinion and party decisions. Beneath this stratum, abstaining from their own opinions, there lays the broad mass of the party, before whom every decision stands in the form of a summons or a command.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other senior communists who had similar concerns sent <i><a href="/wiki/The_Declaration_of_46" title="The Declaration of 46">The Declaration of 46</a></i> to the Central Committee on October 15, in which they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>[...] we observe an ever progressing, barely disguised division of the party into a secretarial hierarchy and into "laymen", into professional party functionaries, chosen from above, and the other party masses, who take no part in social life. [...] free discussion within the party has virtually disappeared, party public opinion has been stifled. [...] it is the secretarial hierarchy, the party hierarchy which to an ever greater degree chooses the delegates to the conferences and congresses, which to an ever greater degree are becoming the executive conferences of this hierarchy.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the <i>troika</i> and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's <i>Pravda</i> article published on November 7. Throughout November, the <i>troika</i> tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralize, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On December 5, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution.</p>
<p>On December 8, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The <i>troika</i> used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting "the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks"<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> and other sins. Trotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as <i>The New Course</i> in January 1924. The illusion of a "monolithic Bolshevik leadership" was thus shattered and a lively intra-Party discussion ensued, both in local Party organizations and in the pages of <i>Pravda</i>. The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of January 16, 17 and 18, 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee's position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the <a href="/wiki/Left_Opposition" title="Left Opposition">Left Opposition</a>.</p>
<p>Since the <i>troika</i> controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin's Secretariat as well as <i>Pravda</i> through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organization, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-<i>troika</i> delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position and the Conference denounced "Trotskyism"<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> as a "petty bourgeois deviation". After the Conference, a number of Trotsky's supporters, especially in the Red Army's Political Directorate, were removed from leading positions or reassigned. Nonetheless, Trotsky kept all of his posts and the <i>troika</i> was careful to emphasize that the debate was limited to Trotsky's "mistakes" and that removing Trotsky from the leadership was out of the question. In reality, Trotsky had already been cut off from the decision making process.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Conference, Trotsky left for a <a href="/wiki/Caucasus_(geographic_region)" title="Caucasus (geographic region)" class="mw-redirect">Caucasian</a> resort to recover from his prolonged illness. On his way, he learned about Lenin's death on January 21, 1924. He was about to return when a follow up telegram from Stalin arrived, giving an incorrect date of the scheduled funeral, which would have made it impossible for Trotsky to return in time. Many commentators speculated after the fact that Trotsky's absence from Moscow in the days following Lenin's death contributed to his eventual loss to Stalin, although Trotsky generally discounted the significance of his absence.</p>

<p>There was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his "mistakes" were often alluded to by <i>troika</i> partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the <i>troika</i> and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Frunze" title="Mikhail Frunze">Mikhail Frunze</a>, who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.</p>
<p>At the XIIIth Party Congress in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>None of us desires or is able to dispute the will of the Party. Clearly, the Party is always right.... We can only be right with and by the Party, for history has provided no other way of being in the right. The English have a saying, "My country, right or wrong," whether it is in the right or in the wrong, it is my country. We have much better historical justification in saying whether it is right or wrong in certain individual concrete cases, it is my party.... And if the Party adopts a decision which one or other of us thinks unjust, he will say, just or unjust, it is my party, and I shall support the consequences of the decision to the end.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attempt at reconciliation, however, did not stop <i>troika</i> supporters from taking potshots at him.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Left Opposition, which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intra-Party "regime", began to crystallize. It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the <i>troika</i>, but it also began formulating a program. Economically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician Yevgeny Preobrazhensky came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favor of faster industrialization. That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the "Right" group within the Party, who supported <i>troika</i> at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an "acceleration" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building '<a href="/wiki/Socialism_in_One_Country" title="Socialism in One Country">Socialism in One Country</a>'. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.</p>
<p>At the XIIIth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the <i>troika</i>, always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published <i>The Lessons of October</i>, an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution. In it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the <i>Literary Discussion</i>, with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trotsky's disagreements and conflicts with Lenin and the Bolsheviks prior to 1917</li>
<li>Trotsky's alleged distortion of the events of 1917 in order to emphasize his role and diminish the roles played by other Bolsheviks</li>
<li>Trotsky's harsh treatment of his subordinates and other alleged mistakes during the Russian Civil War</li>
</ul>
<p>Trotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilized all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on January 6, 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and skillfully played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.</p>

<p>1925 was a difficult year for Trotsky. After the bruising <i>Literary Discussion</i> and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts: chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in <i>My Life</i><sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> that he "was taking a rest from politics" and "naturally plunged into his new line of work up to my ears", but some contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> Later in the year, Trotsky resigned his two technical positions (claiming Stalin-instigated interference and sabotage) and concentrated on his work in the Concessions Committee.</p>
<p>In one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances surrounding the controversy around Lenin's Testament were described by American Marxist <a href="/wiki/Max_Eastman" title="Max Eastman">Max Eastman</a> in his book <i>Since Lenin Died</i> (1925). The Soviet leadership denounced Eastman's account and used <a href="/wiki/Party_discipline" title="Party discipline">party discipline</a> to force Trotsky to write an article denying Eastman's version of the events.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>In the meantime, the <i>troika</i> finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance <a href="/wiki/Grigory_Sokolnikov" title="Grigory Sokolnikov">Grigory Sokolnikov</a> aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the XIVth Party Congress in December 1925. With only the Leningrad Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed <i>The New Opposition</i>, were thoroughly defeated while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and didn't speak at the Congress.</p>

<p>During a lull in the intra-party fighting in the spring of 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the <i>New Opposition</i> gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the United Opposition.</p>
<p>The United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_Revolution" title="Chinese Revolution">Chinese Revolution</a>. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XVth Party Conference in October 1926 Trotsky could barely speak due to interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927 Stalin started using the <a href="/wiki/Gosudarstvennoye_Politicheskoye_Upravlenie" title="Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie" class="mw-redirect">GPU</a> (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank and file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.</p>

<p>In October 1927, Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Central Committee. When the United Opposition tried to organize independent demonstrations commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1927, the demonstrators were dispersed by force and Trotsky and Zinoviev were expelled from the Communist Party on November 12. Their leading supporters, from Kamenev down, were expelled in December 1927 by the XVth Party Congress, which paved the way for mass expulsions of rank and file oppositionists as well as internal exile of opposition leaders in early 1928.</p>
<p>When the XVth Party Congress made Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course.</p>

<p>After Trotsky's expulsion from the country, exiled Trotskyists began to waver and, between 1929 and 1934, most of the leading members of the Opposition surrendered to Stalin, "admitted their mistakes" and were reinstated in the Communist Party.

There were many former White Army officers in Istanbul, which put Trotsky's life in danger, but a number of Trotsky's European supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety.</p>
<p>In 1933 Trotsky was offered asylum in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> by <a href="/wiki/%C3%89douard_Daladier" title="Édouard Daladier">Daladier</a>.

<p>At first Trotsky was opposed to the idea of establishing parallel Communist Parties or a parallel international Communist organization that would compete with the <a href="/wiki/Third_International" title="Third International" class="mw-redirect">Third International</a> for fear of splitting the Communist movement. However, he changed his mind in mid-1933 after the <a href="/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> takeover in Germany and the Comintern's response to it, when he <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-ger/330715.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1930-ger/330715.htm" rel="nofollow">proclaimed</a> that:</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1939 Trotsky agreed to go to the United States to appear as a witness before the <a href="/wiki/Martin_Dies,_Jr." title="Martin Dies, Jr.">Dies</a> Committee of the House of Representatives, a forerunner of the <a href="/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" title="House Un-American Activities Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>.

<p>For forty-three years of my conscious life I have remained a revolutionist; for forty-two of them I have fought under the banner of Marxism. If I had to begin all over again I would of course try to avoid this or that mistake, but the main course of my life would remain unchanged.

<p>On August 20, 1940, Trotsky was successfully attacked in his home by a <a href="/wiki/NKVD" title="NKVD">NKVD</a> agent, <a href="/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Mercader" title="Ramón Mercader">Ramón Mercader</a>, who buried the pick of an <a href="/wiki/Ice_axe" title="Ice axe">ice axe</a> into Trotsky's skull.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45" title=""><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The blow was poorly delivered and failed to kill Trotsky instantly, as Mercader had intended. Witnesses stated that Trotsky spat on Mercader and began struggling fiercely with him. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky's bodyguards burst into the room and nearly killed Mercader, but Trotsky stopped them, shouting, "Do not kill him! This man has a story to tell."<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46" title=""><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> Trotsky was taken to a hospital, operated on, and survived for more than a day, dying at the age of 60 on August 21, 1940 as a result of severe brain damage.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47" title=""><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> Mercader later testified at his trial:</p>

<p>Permanent Revolution is the theory that the <a href="/wiki/Bourgeois" title="Bourgeois" class="mw-redirect">bourgeois</a> <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democratic</a> tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against <a href="/wiki/Capitalist" title="Capitalist">capitalist</a> property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into <a href="/wiki/Proletarian" title="Proletarian" class="mw-redirect">proletarian</a> tasks.</p>
<p>Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for Permanent Revolution is first found in the writings of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="/wiki/Friedrich_Engels" title="Friedrich Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> in March 1850, in the aftermath of the <a href="/wiki/1848_Revolution" title="1848 Revolution" class="mw-redirect">1848 Revolution</a>, in their <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm" rel="nofollow">Address</a> of the Central Committee to the <a href="/wiki/Communist_League" title="Communist League">Communist League</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>It is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent until all the more or less propertied classes have been driven from their ruling positions, until the proletariat has conquered state power and until the association of the proletarians has progressed sufficiently far - not only in one country but in all the leading countries of the world - that competition between the proletarians of these countries ceases and at least the decisive forces of production are concentrated in the hands of the workers. ... Their battle-cry must be:</i> "The Permanent Revolution."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trotsky's conception of Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism <a href="/wiki/Georgy_Plekhanov" title="Georgy Plekhanov" class="mw-redirect">Georgy Plekhanov</a>, that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. This conception was first developed by Trotsky in collaboration with <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Parvus" title="Alexander Parvus">Alexander Parvus</a> in late 1904 - 1905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books <i>1905</i> and in <i>Permanent Revolution</i>, which also contains his essay "Results and Prospects".</p>

After Krestinsky's ouster in March 1921, Vyacheslav Molotov became the senior secretary, but he lacked Krestinsky's authority since he was not a full Politburo member. The position was taken over by Stalin and formalized at the XIth Party Congress in April 1922, with Molotov becoming second secretary.</li>
<li id="cite_note-25"><b><a href="#cite_ref-25" title="">^</a></b> It is not clear why Kamenev, a mild mannered man with few leadership ambitions as well as Trotsky's brother-in-law, sided with Zinoviev and Stalin against Trotsky in 1922. Trotsky later speculated that it may have been due to Kamenev's love of comfort, which Trotsky found "repell[ing]" and <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/xx/kremlin.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/xx/kremlin.htm" rel="nofollow">let Kamenev know</a> in late 1920 or early 1921:

<li id="cite_note-26"><b><a href="#cite_ref-26" title="">^</a></b> The Central Committee's Secretariat became increasingly important during the Civil War and especially in its aftermath as the Party switched from elected officials to appointed ones. The change was prompted by the need to allocate manpower quickly during the Civil War as well as by the transformation of the party from a small group of revolutionaries into the country's ruling party with a corresponding increase in membership. New members included career seekers and former members of banned socialist parties who were viewed with apprehension by Old Bolsheviks. To prevent a possible degeneration of the party, various membership requirements were instituted for party officials and the ultimate power of appointment of local officials was reserved for the Secretariat of the Central Committee. This put enormous power in the General Secretary's hands.</li>

<p>The need of the hour was for a man who would incarnate the call to struggle, a man who, subordinating himself completely to the requirements of the struggle, would become the ringing summons to arms, the will which exacts from all unconditional submission to a great, sacrificial necessity. Only a man with Trotsky's capacity for work, only a man so unsparing of himself as Trotsky, only a man who knew how to speak to the soldiers as Trotsky did—only such a man could have become the standard bearer of the armed toilers. He was all things rolled into one.</p>

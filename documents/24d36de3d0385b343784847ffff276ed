<p>The Reverend <a href="/wiki/John_Keble" title="John Keble">John Keble</a>, who would become one of the leaders of the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Movement" title="Oxford Movement">Oxford Movement</a>, stood as godfather to Matthew.

In 1831, Arnold was tutored by his uncle, the Reverend John Buckland, at Laleham, Middlesex. In 1834, the Arnolds occupied a holiday home, Fox How, in the Lake District. <a href="/wiki/William_Wordsworth" title="William Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> was a neighbor and close friend. Fox How became the family home after Dr. Arnold's untimely death in 1842.</p>
<p>In 1836, Arnold was sent to <a href="/wiki/Winchester_College" title="Winchester College">Winchester College</a>, but in 1837 he returned to Rugby School where he was enrolled in the fifth form. He moved to the sixth form in 1838 and thus came under the direct tutelage of his father. He wrote verse for the manuscript Fox How Magazine produced by Matthew and his brother Tom for the family's enjoyment from 1838 to 1843. During his years as a Rugby student, he won school prizes for English essay writing, and Latin and English poetry. His prize poem, "Alaric at Rome," was printed at Rugby.</p>
<p>In 1841, he won an open scholarship to <a href="/wiki/Balliol_College" title="Balliol College" class="mw-redirect">Balliol College</a>, Oxford. During his residence at Oxford, his friendship ripened with <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Hugh_Clough" title="Arthur Hugh Clough">Arthur Hugh Clough</a>, another graduate of Rugby who had been one of his father's favourites. Arnold attended <a href="/wiki/John_Henry_Newman" title="John Henry Newman">John Henry Newman</a>'s sermons at <a href="/wiki/University_Church_of_St_Mary_the_Virgin" title="University Church of St Mary the Virgin">St. Mary's</a>, but did not join the Oxford Movement. His father died suddenly of heart disease in 1842. Arnold's poem "Cromwell" won the 1843 <a href="/wiki/Newdigate_prize" title="Newdigate prize" class="mw-redirect">Newdigate prize</a>. He graduated in the following year with a 2nd Class Honours degree in "Greats."</p>
<p>In 1845, after a short interlude of teaching at Rugby, he was elected Fellow of <a href="/wiki/Oriel_College" title="Oriel College" class="mw-redirect">Oriel College</a>, Oxford. In 1847, he became Private Secretary to <a href="/wiki/Marquess_of_Lansdowne" title="Marquess of Lansdowne">Lord Lansdowne</a>, <a href="/wiki/Lord_President_of_the_Council" title="Lord President of the Council">Lord President of the Council</a>. In 1849, he published his first book of poetry, The Strayed Reveller. In 1850 Wordsworth died; Arnold published his "Memorial Verses" on the older poet in Fraser's Magazine.</p>

<p>Wishing to marry, but unable to support a family on the wages of a private secretary, Arnold sought the position of, and was appointed, in April 1851, one of Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools. Two months later, he married Frances Lucy, daughter of Sir William Wightman, Justice of the Queen's Bench. The Arnolds had six children: Thomas (1852-1868); Trevenen William (1853-1872); Richard Penrose (1855-1908), an inspector of factories<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>; Lucy Charlotte (1858-1934) who married Frederick W. Whitridge of New York, whom she had met during Arnold's American lecture tour; Eleanore Mary Caroline (1861-1936) married (1) Hon. Armine Wodehouse in 1889, (2) William Masefield, Baron Sandhurst, in 1909; Basil Francis (1866-1868).</p>
<p>Arnold often described his duties as a school inspector as "drudgery," although "at other times he acknowledged the benefit of regular work."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The inspectorship required him, at least at first, to travel constantly and across much of England. "Initially, Arnold was responsible for inspecting Nonconformist schools across a broad swath of central England. He spent many dreary hours during the 1850s in railway waiting-rooms and small-town hotels, and longer hours still in listening to children reciting their lessons and parents reciting their grievances. But that also meant that he, among the first generation of the railway age, travelled across more of England than any man of letters had ever done. Although his duties were later confined to a smaller area, Arnold knew the society of provincial England better than most of the metropolitan authors and politicians of the day." <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In 1852, Arnold published his second volume of poems, <i>Empedocles on Etna, and Other Poems</i>. In 1853, he published <i>Poems: A New Edition</i>, a selection from the two earlier volumes famously excluding "Empedocles on Etna", but adding new poems, "Sohrab and Rustum" and "The Scholar-Gipsy". In 1854, <i>Poems: Second Series</i> appeared; also a selection, it included the new poem, "Balder Dead".</p>
<p>Arnold was elected <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Professor_of_Poetry" title="Oxford Professor of Poetry">Professor of Poetry</a> at Oxford in 1857. He was the first to deliver his lectures in English rather than Latin. He was re-elected in 1862. <i><a href="/wiki/On_Translating_Homer" title="On Translating Homer">On Translating Homer</a></i> (1861) and the initial thoughts that Arnold would transform into <i>Culture and Anarchy</i> were among the fruits of the Oxford lectures. In 1859, he conducted the first of three trips to the continent at the behest of parliament to study European educational practices. He self-published The <i>Popular Education of France</i> (1861), the introduction to which was later published under the title "Democracy" (1879).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1865, Arnold published <i>Essays in Criticism: First Series</i>. <i>Essays in Criticism: Second Series</i> would not appear until November 1888, shortly after his untimely death. In 1866, he published <i><a href="/wiki/Thyrsis" title="Thyrsis">Thyrsis</a></i>, his elegy to Clough who had died in 1861. <i>Culture and Anarchy</i>, Arnold's major work in social criticism (and one of the few pieces of his prose work currently in print) was published in 1869. <i>Literature and Dogma</i>, Arnold's major work in religious criticism appeared in 1873. In 1883 and 1884, Arnold toured the United States delivering lectures on education, democracy and <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson" title="Ralph Waldo Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>.</p>
<p>In 1886, he retired from school inspection and made another trip to America. Arnold died suddenly in 1888 of heart failure, when running to meet a tram that would have taken him to the Liverpool Landing Stage to see his daughter, who was visiting from the United States where she had moved after marrying an American.</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold "was indeed the most delightful of companions," wrote G. W. E. Russell in <i>Portraits of the Seventies</i>; "a man of the world entirely free from worldliness and a man of letters without the faintest trace of pedantry." <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> A familiar figure at the <a href="/wiki/Athenaeum_Club" title="Athenaeum Club">Athenaeum Club</a>, a frequent diner-out and guest at great country houses, fond of fishing and shooting, a lively conversationalist, affecting a combination of foppishness and Olympian grandeur, he read constantly, widely, and deeply, and in the intervals of supporting himself and his family by the quiet drudgery of school inspecting, filled notebook after notebook with meditations of an almost monastic tone. In his writings, he often baffled and sometimes annoyed his contemporaries by the apparent contradiction between his urbane, even frivolous manner in controversy, and the "high seriousness" of his critical views and the melancholy, almost plaintive note of much of his poetry. "A voice poking fun in the wilderness" was T. H. Warren's description of him.</p>

<p>Arnold is sometimes called the third great Victorian poet, along with <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Tennyson,_1st_Baron_Tennyson" title="Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson">Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_Browning" title="Robert Browning">Robert Browning</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Arnold was keenly aware of his place in poetry. In an 1869 letter to his mother, he wrote:</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">My poems represent, on the whole, the main movement of mind of the last quarter of a century, and thus they will probably have their day as people become conscious to themselves of what that movement of mind is, and interested in the literary productions which reflect it. It might be fairly urged that I have less poetical sentiment than Tennyson and less intellectual vigour and abundance than Browning; yet because I have perhaps more of a fusion of the two than either of them, and have more regularly applied that fusion to the main line of modern development, I am likely enough to have my turn as they have had theirs." <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></td>

<p>Collini regards this as "an exceptionally frank, but not unjust, self-assessment." "Arnold's poetry continues to have scholarly attention lavished upon it, in part because it seems to furnish such striking evidence for several central aspects of the intellectual history of the nineteenth century, especially the corrosion of 'Faith' by 'Doubt'. No poet, presumably, would wish to be summoned by later ages <i>merely</i> as an historical witness, but the sheer intellectual grasp of Arnold's verse renders it peculiarly liable to this treatment." <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Harold Bloom echoes Arnold's self reference in his introduction (as series editor) to the <i>Modern Critical Views</i> volume on Arnold: "Arnold got into his poetry what Tennyson and Browning scarcely needed (but absorbed anyway), the main march of mind of his time." Of his poetry, Bloom says, "Whatever his achievement as a critic of literature, society, or religion, his work as a poet may not merit the reputation it has continued to hold in the twentieth century. Arnold is, at his best, a very good but highly derivative poet... As with Tennyson, Hopkins, and Rossetti, Arnold's dominant precursor was Keats, but this is an unhappy puzzle, since Arnold (unlike the others) professed not to admire Keats greatly, while writing his own elegiac poems in a diction, meter, imagistic procedure, that are embarrassingly close to Keats." <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Sir Edmund Chambers noted, however, that "in a comparison between the best works of Matthew Arnold and that of his six greatest contemporaries... the proportion of work which endures is greater in the case of Matthew Arnold than in any one of them." <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Chambers judged Arnold's poetic vision by "its simplicity, lucidity, and straightforwardness; its literalness...; the sparing use of aureate words, or of far-fetched words, which are all the more effective when they come; the avoidance of inversions, and the general directness of syntax, which gives full value to the delicacies of a varied rhythm, and makes it, of all verse that I know, the easiest to read aloud." <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>His literary career — leaving out the two prize poems — had begun in 1849 with the publication of <i>The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems</i> by A., which attracted little notice — although it contained perhaps Arnold's most purely poetical poem "The Forsaken Merman" — and was soon withdrawn. <i>Empedocles on Etna and Other Poems</i> (among them "Tristram and Iseult"), published in 1852, had a similar fate. In 1858 he brought out his tragedy of "Merope," calculated, he wrote to a friend, "rather to inaugurate my Professorship with dignity than to move deeply the present race of humans," and chiefly remarkable for some experiments in unusual — and unsuccessful — metres.</p>
<p>His 1867 poem "<a href="/wiki/Dover_Beach" title="Dover Beach">Dover Beach</a>" depicted a nightmarish world from which the old religious verities have receded. It is sometimes held up as an early, if not the first, example of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Modern_sensibility&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Modern sensibility (page does not exist)">modern sensibility</a>. In a famous preface to a selection of the poems of <a href="/wiki/William_Wordsworth" title="William Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, Arnold identified himself, a little ironically, as a "Wordsworthian." The influence of Wordsworth, both in ideas and in diction, is unmistakable in Arnold's best poetry. Arnold's poem, "Dover Beach" appears in Ray Bradbury's <i><a href="/wiki/Fahrenheit_451" title="Fahrenheit 451">Fahrenheit 451</a></i> and is also featured prominently in <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_(novel)" title="Saturday (novel)">Saturday</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Ian_McEwan" title="Ian McEwan">Ian McEwan</a>. It has also been quoted or alluded to in a variety of other contexts (see <a href="/wiki/Dover_Beach" title="Dover Beach">Dover Beach</a>).</p>
<p>Some consider Arnold to be the bridge between <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Modernism" title="Modernism">Modernism</a>. His use of symbolic landscapes was typical of the Romantic era, while his skeptical and pessimistic perspective was typical of the Modern era. The <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" title="Rationalism">rationalistic</a> tendency of certain of his writings gave offence to many readers, and the sufficiency of his equipment in scholarship for dealing with some of the subjects which he handled was called in question, but he undoubtedly exercised a stimulating influence on his time. His writings are characterised by the finest culture, high purpose, sincerity, and a style of great distinction, and much of his poetry has an exquisite and subtle beauty, though here also it has been doubted whether <a href="/wiki/High_culture" title="High culture">high culture</a> and wide knowledge of poetry did not sometimes take the place of true poetic fire. <a href="/wiki/Henry_James" title="Henry James">Henry James</a> wrote that Matthew Arnold's poetry will appeal to those who "like their pleasures rare" and who like to hear the poet "taking breath."</p>
<p>The mood of Arnold’s poetry tends to be of plaintive reflection, and he is restrained in expressing emotion. He felt that poetry should be the ‘criticism of life’ and express a philosophy. Arnold’s philosophy is that true happiness comes from within, and that people should seek within themselves for good, while being resigned in acceptance of outward things and avoiding the pointless turmoil of the world. However, he argues that we should not live in the belief that we shall one day inherit eternal bliss. If we are not happy on earth, we should moderate our desires rather than live in dreams of something that may never be attained. This philosophy is clearly expressed in such poems as "Dover Beach" and in these lines from "Stanzas from the Grande Chartreuse":</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wandering between two worlds, one dead</dd>
<dd>The other powerless to be born,</dd>
<dd>With nowhere yet to rest my head</dd>
<dd>Like these, on earth I wait forlorn.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Arnold valued natural scenery for its peace and permanence in contrast with the ceaseless change of human things. His descriptions are often picturesque, and marked by striking similes. However, at the same time he liked subdued colours, mist and moonlight. He seems to prefer the ‘spent lights’ of the sea-depths in "The Forsaken Merman" to the village life preferred by the merman’s lost wife.</p>
<p>In his poetry he derived not only the subject matter of his narrative poems from various traditional or literary sources but even much of the romantic melancholy of his earlier poems from <a href="/wiki/Senancour" title="Senancour" class="mw-redirect">Senancour</a>'s "Obermann". His greatest defects as a poet stem from his lack of ear and his frequent failure to distinguish between poetry and prose.</p>

<p>Assessing the importance of Arnold's prose work in 1988, Stefan Collini stated, "for reasons to do with our own cultural preoccupations as much as with the merits of his writing, the best of his prose has a claim on us today that cannot be matched by his poetry." <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> "Certainly there may still be some readers who, vaguely recalling 'Dover Beach' or 'The Scholar Gypsy' from school anthologies, are surprised to find he 'also' wrote prose." <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>George Watson follows George Saintsbury in dividing Arnold's career as a prose writer into three phases: 1) early literary criticism that begins with his preface to the 1853 edition of his poems and ends with the first series of <i>Essays in Criticism</i> (1865); 2) a prolonged middle period (overlapping the first and third phases) characterized by social, political and religious writing (roughly 1860-1875); 3) a return to literary criticism with the selecting and editing of collections of Wordsworth's and Byron's poetry and the second series of <i>Essays in Criticism</i>. <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Both Watson and Saintsbury declare their preference for Arnold's literary criticism over his social or religious criticism. More recent writers, such as Collini, have shown a greater interest in his social writing,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> while over the years a significant second tier of criticism has focused on Arnold's religious writing.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> His writing on education has not drawn a significant critical endeavor separable from the criticism of his social writings.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Matthew_Arnold&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Literary criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Literary criticism</span></h3>
<p>Arnold's work as a literary critic began with the 1853 "Preface to the Poems". In it, he attempted to explain his extreme act of self-censorship in excluding the dramatic poem "Empedocles on Etna". With its emphasis on the importance of subject in poetry, on "clearness of arrangement, rigor of development, simplicity of style" learned from the Greeks, and in the strong imprint of Goethe and Wordsworth, may be observed nearly all the essential elements in his critical theory. George Watson described the preface, written by the thirty-one year old Arnold, as "oddly stiff and graceless when we think of the elegance of his later prose." <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Criticism began to take first place in Arnold's writing with his appointment in 1857 to the professorship of poetry at Oxford, which he held for two successive terms of five years. In 1861 his lectures <i><a href="/wiki/On_Translating_Homer" title="On Translating Homer">On Translating Homer</a></i> were published, to be followed in 1862 by <i>Last Words on Translating Homer</i>, both volumes admirable in style and full of striking judgments and suggestive remarks, but built on rather arbitrary assumptions and reaching no well-established conclusions. Especially characteristic, both of his defects and his qualities, are on the one hand, Arnold's unconvincing advocacy of English <a href="/wiki/Hexameter" title="Hexameter">hexameters</a> and his creation of a kind of literary absolute in the "grand style," and, on the other, his keen feeling of the need for a disinterested and intelligent criticism in England.</p>
<p>Although Arnold's poetry received only mixed reviews and attention during his lifetime, his forays into literary criticism were more successful. Arnold is famous for introducing a methodology of <a href="/wiki/Literary_criticism" title="Literary criticism">literary criticism</a> somewhere between the historicist approach common to many critics at the time and the personal essay; he often moved quickly and easily from literary subjects to political and social issues. His <i>Essays in Criticism</i> (1865, 1888), remains a significant influence on critics to this day. In one of his most famous essays on the topic, “The Study of Poetry”, Arnold wrote that, “Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry”. He considered the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were “high truth” and “high seriousness”. By this standard, Chaucer’s <a href="/wiki/Canterbury_Tales" title="Canterbury Tales" class="mw-redirect">Canterbury Tales</a> did not merit Arnold’s approval. Further, Arnold thought the works that had been proven to possess both “high truth” and “high seriousness”, such as those of Shakespeare and Milton, could be used as a basis of comparison to determine the merit of other works of poetry. He also sought for literary criticism to remain disinterested, and said that the appreciation should be of “the object as in itself it really is.”</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Matthew_Arnold&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Social criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social criticism</span></h3>
<p>He was led on from literary criticism to a more general critique of the <a href="/wiki/Zeitgeist" title="Zeitgeist">spirit of his age</a>. Between 1867 and 1869 he wrote <i><a href="/wiki/Culture_and_Anarchy" title="Culture and Anarchy">Culture and Anarchy</a></i>, famous for the term he popularised for the middle class of the English <a href="/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a> population: "<a href="/wiki/Philistines" title="Philistines">Philistines</a>", a word which derives its <a href="/wiki/Philistinism" title="Philistinism">modern cultural meaning</a> (in English - the German-language usage was well established) from him. <i>Culture and Anarchy</i> is also famous for its popularization of the phrase "sweetness and light," first coined by <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Swift" title="Jonathan Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Arnold's "want of logic and thoroughness of thought" as noted by J. M. Robertson in Modern Humanists was an aspect of the inconsistency of which Arnold was accused. Few of his ideas were his own, and he failed to reconcile the conflicting influences which moved him so strongly. "There are four people, in especial," he once wrote to <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_Newman" title="Cardinal Newman" class="mw-redirect">Cardinal Newman</a>, "from whom I am conscious of having learnt — a very different thing from merely receiving a strong impression — learnt habits, methods, ruling ideas, which are constantly with me; and the four are — <a href="/wiki/Goethe" title="Goethe" class="mw-redirect">Goethe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wordsworth" title="Wordsworth" class="mw-redirect">Wordsworth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sainte-Beuve" title="Sainte-Beuve" class="mw-redirect">Sainte-Beuve</a>, and yourself." Dr. Arnold must be added; the son's fundamental likeness to the father was early pointed out by <a href="/wiki/Algernon_Charles_Swinburne" title="Algernon Charles Swinburne">Swinburne</a>, and was later attested by Matthew Arnold's grandson, Mr. Arnold Whitridge. Brought up in the tenets of the Philistinism which, as a professed cosmopolitan and the Apostle of Culture he attacked, he remained something of a Philistine to the end.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Matthew_Arnold&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Religious criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Religious criticism</span></h3>
<p>His religious views were unusual for his time. Scholars of Arnold's works disagree on the nature of Arnold's personal religious beliefs. Under the influence of <a href="/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza" title="Baruch Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a> and his father, Dr. Thomas Arnold, he rejected the superstitious elements in religion, even while retaining a fascination for church rituals. Arnold seems to belong to a pragmatic middle ground that is more concerned with the poetry of religion and its virtues and values for society than with the existence of God. He wrote in the preface of <i>God and the Bible</i> in 1875 “The personages of the Christian heaven and their conversations are no more matter of fact than the personages of the Greek Olympus and their conversations.” <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> He also wrote in <i>Literature and Dogma</i>: "The word 'God' is used in most cases as by no means a term of science or exact knowledge, but a term of poetry and eloquence, a term thrown out, so to speak, as a not fully grasped object of the speaker's consciousness — a literary term, in short; and mankind mean different things by it as their consciousness differs." <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> He defined religion as "morality touched with emotion". <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> However, he also wrote in the same book, "to pass from a Christianity relying on its miracles to a Christianity relying on its natural truth is a great change. It can only be brought about by those whose attachment to Christianity is such, that they cannot part with it, and yet cannot but deal with it sincerely." <sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> It seems likely by the context of this statement that he means himself to be counted amongst those who cannot part with Christianity even as they deal with it "sincerely".</p>

Neither the greatest poet nor the greatest critic, Arnold was able to achieve distinction in both areas, making his contributions to literature greater than those of virtually any other writer before him." Mazzeno, 1999, pg. 8.</dd>

<li>Stefan Collini, Arnold (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A good starting point for those new to Arnold's prose. "Like many late century scholars, Collini believes Arnold's chief contribution to English literature is as a critic. ... Collini insists Arnold remains a force in literary criticism because 'he characterizes in unforgettable ways' the role that literary and cultural criticism 'can and must play in modern societies'" (pg 67).

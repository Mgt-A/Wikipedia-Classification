<p>A young man named Speed Racer wants to become a professional racer, despite the lack of his Pops Racer's (his father) approval. When Pops reluctantly quits his job after the corporate company he was working for had declined the production of a modified engine for his new racing car, the Mach 5, he later thinks of creating his own family owned company, Racer Motors (Mifune Motors in Japan). He realizes that he would need a great amount of money to make his idea work. Nonetheless, Pops conceals his plans for the Mach 5's new engine on a windshield. Speed, who values the welfare of his family, decides to take it upon himself to obtain the money for Pops. In hopes of using his unique driving skills to do so, Speed decides to do what he does best and enters a race.</p>
<p>Speed, along with the help of his friend and mechanic, Sparky, tune up and adjust the Mach 5 in preparation for the race, attaching a new windshield in the process. Unbeknownst to them, they had taken Pops' windshield that concealed the plans for the new engine. Speed takes the windshield along to the race the next day. With the windshield, Speed unwittingly brought trouble towards him, for a corporate gang, who is after Pops' revolutionary designs for the engine, sabotages the race, putting Speed in peril.</p>
<p>Speed, through his wit, realizes that the Pops had hidden the plans on the windshield and fights hard to prevent the gang from doing so. In a last minute effort to save his father's hard work, Speed shatters the windshield with his helmet so that in effect, nobody walks away with the plans. With the gang out of the way, Speed finishes and wins the race...however, he doesn't win the prize money since officials had found out that the race was sabotaged by the corporate gang. A slightly disappointed Speed apologizes to a slightly frustrated Pops, who had found out that Speed had entered the race, for entering the race and destroying his plans. Pops tells Speed that the plans were always locked within his head and gets slightly enraged and tells Speed to quit racing. Speed, who is confident enough to ignore Pops, drives away into many different adventures that come towards him and his friends.</p>

Tatsuo Yoshida's Mach GoGoGo manga.<br />

<b>Bottom Row</b>:Volume 1 (Reprint), Sun Wide Comics release</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Selected chapters of Tatsuo Yoshida's original <i>Mach GoGoGo</i> manga series were reprinted by Now Comics as <i>Speed Racer Classics</i> and by <a href="/wiki/DC_Comics" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a>/<a href="/wiki/Wildstorm_Productions" title="Wildstorm Productions" class="mw-redirect">Wildstorm Productions</a> as <i>Speed Racer: The Original Manga</i> (<a href="/wiki/Special:BookSources/1563896869" class="internal">ISBN 1-56389-686-9</a>). In 2008, a hardcover box set of the complete manga series was released by <a href="/wiki/Digital_Manga_Publishing" title="Digital Manga Publishing">Digital Manga Publishing</a> as <i>Speed Racer: Mach Go Go Go</i> (<a href="/wiki/Special:BookSources/9781569707319" class="internal">ISBN 978-156970731-9</a>).</p>
<p>The characters and story lines originated in <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Manga" title="Manga">manga</a> and anime series <i>Mach GoGoGo,</i> from the anime studio <a href="/wiki/Tatsunoko_Productions" title="Tatsunoko Productions" class="mw-redirect">Tatsunoko Productions</a>.</p>
<p><i>Mach GoGoGo</i> was first created and designed by anime pioneer <a href="/wiki/Tatsuo_Yoshida" title="Tatsuo Yoshida">Tatsuo Yoshida</a> (1932–1977) as a manga series in the 1960s and made the jump to <a href="/wiki/Television" title="Television">TV</a> as an anime series in 1967. The actual manga was inspired by Yoshida’s earlier, and most popular automobile racing comics, <i><b>Pilot Ace</b></i>. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Pilot Ace’s main storyline would be lifted onto Mach GoGoGo, which followed the adventures of an ambitious young man who would soon become a professional racer.</p>
<p>When Yoshida had plans for a newer project, he took the popularity of Pilot Ace to his advantage. The characters’ designs in Pilot Ace would set the main ground for the character design in a newer project entitled, Mach GoGoGo. Yoshida got his idea for his story after seeing two films that were very popular in Japan at the time, <i><a href="/wiki/Viva_Las_Vegas" title="Viva Las Vegas">Viva Las Vegas</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Goldfinger_(film)" title="Goldfinger (film)">Goldfinger</a>.</i> By combining the look of <a href="/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s race-car driving image, complete with neckerchief and black <a href="/wiki/Pompadour_(hairstyle)" title="Pompadour (hairstyle)">pompadour</a>, and <a href="/wiki/James_Bond" title="James Bond">James Bond</a>'s gadget-filled <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin" title="Aston Martin">Aston Martin</a>, Yoshida had the inspiration for his creation. Soon enough, Mach GoGoGo hit shelves in the early 1960’s. The central character in the anime and manga was a young race car driver named Gō Mifune (<i>Mifune Gō</i>).</p>
<p>The name of the series, <i>Mach GoGoGo</i> is actually a triple <a href="/wiki/Pun" title="Pun">pun</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Go" is the Japanese word for the number 5. Thus "Mach-go" is the name of the car ("go" also being a suffix attached to the names of ships, etc.), which would be called the Mach 5 in the American adaptation</li>
<li>It is the name of the main character, Go Mifune. (Speed Racer in the American adaptation)</li>
<li>It contains the English word "go."</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, the program's title means, "<b>Mach-go</b>, <b>Gō</b> Mifune, <b>Go</b>!". This is what the saying "Go, Speed Racer, Go!" comes from, taking out Gō Mifune and replacing it with his English name.</p>
<p>Also: "Gogogo", is used as a general Japanese sound effect for "Rumble". The names themselves constitute a multilingual wordplay of the kind that had started to become part of the Japanese popular culture of the time.</p>
<p>The manga (which was compiled into 2 deluxe volumes for Fusosha's re-release) has several story lines such as "The Great Plan", "Challenge of the Masked Racer", "The Fire Race", "The Secret Engine" and "Race for Revenge" that have been adapted to the anime, each story having similar story lines. However, minor changes occur between both the original manga and the anime series. Differences include minor changes in some story lines and back stories of several characters and places.</p>
<p>A few years later after the volumes were released, Yoshida decided to release his manga series as an anime program, adding new and heart-pounding plots in addition to the original stories in the manga. 52 episodes aired in Japan, each one emulating the fast-paced action of the manga.</p>

<p>The manga spawned an anime adaptation which became a bigger success than the manga which was created around the same time as its appearance. In 1997, Tatsunoko produced a modernized version of <i><b>Mach GoGoGo</b></i> which aired on <a href="/wiki/TV_Tokyo" title="TV Tokyo">TV Tokyo</a> and lasted for 34 episodes. An English adaptation of this remake was produced by <a href="/wiki/DiC" title="DiC" class="mw-redirect">DiC</a> titled <i><b><a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer_X" title="Speed Racer X">Speed Racer X</a></b></i>, which aired in 2002 on <a href="/wiki/Nickelodeon_(TV_channel)" title="Nickelodeon (TV channel)">Nickelodeon</a>, but only the first 11 episodes were adapted due to licensing disputes between DiC and the Speed Racer Enterprise.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The English rights to <i>Mach GoGoGo</i> were immediately acquired by American syndicator <a href="/wiki/Trans-Lux" title="Trans-Lux">Trans-Lux</a>. <b>Speed Racer</b> premiered on American television in 1967. In the series, Speed’s full name was Go Mifune, in homage to Japanese film star <a href="/wiki/Toshiro_Mifune" title="Toshiro Mifune" class="mw-redirect">Toshiro Mifune</a>. His name, Americanized, became Speed Racer. His adventures centered on his powerful Mach 5 car, his girlfriend Trixie, his little brother Spritle with pet monkey Chim Chim, and his mysterious older brother, Racer X.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> For American consumption, major <a href="/wiki/Editing" title="Editing">editing</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)" title="Dubbing (filmmaking)">dubbing</a> efforts were undertaken by producer <a href="/wiki/Peter_Fernandez" title="Peter Fernandez">Peter Fernandez</a>, who also <a href="/wiki/Voice_actor" title="Voice actor" class="mw-redirect">provided the voices of</a> many of the characters, most notably Racer X and Speed Racer himself. Fernandez was also responsible for a rearrangement of the <a href="/wiki/Theme_music" title="Theme music">theme song's</a> melody, written by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Nobuyoshi_Koshibe&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Nobuyoshi Koshibe (page does not exist)">Nobuyoshi Koshibe</a>, and subsequently wrote its English lyrics.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A cover of the show’s theme song <b>Go Speed Racer Go</b>, performed by <a href="/wiki/Sponge_(band)" title="Sponge (band)">Sponge</a>, is included on the 1995 <a href="/wiki/Tribute_album" title="Tribute album">tribute album</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Saturday_Morning:_Cartoons%27_Greatest_Hits_(album)" title="Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits (album)" class="mw-redirect">Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits</a></i>, produced by <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Sall" title="Ralph Sall">Ralph Sall</a> for <a href="/wiki/MCA_Records" title="MCA Records">MCA Records</a>.</p>
<p>In a 2008 interview with Chicago Tribune DVD columnist Louis R. Carlozo, Fernandez recalled that he landed the job working on "Speed Racer" after ghost-writing scripts for "<a href="/wiki/Astro_Boy" title="Astro Boy">Astro-Boy</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Gigantor" title="Gigantor">Gigantor</a>." Simultaneously with "Speed Racer," Fernandez also voiced the main character and wrote scripts for another anime series, "<a href="/wiki/Marine_Boy" title="Marine Boy">Marine Boy</a>," sometimes taping both shows in the same day in New York City. Fernandez also said he could not possibly have predicted "Speed Racer's" lasting appeal at the time or in the decades that followed. Reflecting on the series' staying power, he commented: "There was the family relationship. You knew about Speed's family, you knew them well. They were all involved in each race. And we all play with cars as little kids, we love cars. The Mach 5 was a hot car, and there were all sorts of cars throughout all episodes. I still think the Mach Five is ahead of its time."</p>
<p>In an effort to squeeze the complicated plots into existing lip movements, the frenetic pace of the dubbing made <i>Speed Racer</i> famous-—and famously parodied-—for its quirky "fast" dialogue and constant gasping.</p>
<p>The series also reached areas beyond the United States. At about the same time the American series was aired, a Latin American adaptation of the series named, <i>Meteoro</i>, aired on Argentinian TV screens.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s the series made a comeback as reruns on <a href="/wiki/MTV" title="MTV">MTV</a> broadcast in the early morning hours. In 1993, the series was rebroadcast in syndication concurrently with a <a href="/wiki/The_New_Adventures_of_Speed_Racer" title="The New Adventures of Speed Racer">new American-created remake</a> courtesy of the newly established "Speed Racer Enterprises", with distribution by <a href="/wiki/Group_W" title="Group W">Group W</a>'s international unit. In this version, all references to Trans-Lux were removed, with the opening sequence including a recreated logo, and with the episode titles and closing credits recreated (with the latter sequence including three typographical errors: <a href="/wiki/Jack_Grimes" title="Jack Grimes">Jack Grimes</a> is misspelled Jack "Crimes", <a href="/wiki/Hiroshi_Sasagawa" title="Hiroshi Sasagawa">Hiroshi Sasagawa</a> is misspelled Hiroshi "Sasacawa", and "Yomiko" is misspelled "Yumiko"); this is the version that later aired on the <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a> in the late afternoon (and later on in late night/overnight) programming, and is also the version released on Region 1 DVD. This version can also be seen on the streaming video service <a href="/wiki/Hulu" title="Hulu">Hulu</a> (although oddly enough, episode 31--Gang of Assassins, Part 1--is missing; otherwise the complete series is available).</p>

<p>Yoshida selected the names and symbolism in his creation very carefully. The large red M on the hood of the Mach 5, which in North America was assumed to stand for "Mach 5," is actually the emblem of Mifune Motors, the family business. That is also the origin of the "M" on Gō's helmet. This was a homage to Japanese film star <a href="/wiki/Toshiro_Mifune" title="Toshiro Mifune" class="mw-redirect">Toshiro Mifune</a>. In the Latin American version, the "M" stands for "Meteoro", Speed/Go's Latin American name and the name of the series in Latin America which lirerally translates into English as "meteor", an object that can also be related to swiftness and speed.

<p>Beyond <i>Speed Racer'</i>s appeal as an early anime, the series generally is for family entertainment and does not contain the deep intellectual conflicts or controversies seen in anime today. It can be argued that the plots in <i>Speed Racer</i> were more complicated than conventional American cartoons of the 1960s, but the overall purpose was to please a growing fan base worldwide with exciting stories that involved facing adversity on the race track and beyond.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The original <i>Mach GoGoGo</i> episodes underwent minor editing to reach the form which aired in the US and was considered appropriate entertainment for the whole family,. The amount of violence in the series in its American release was almost equal to its original Japanese airing; however, to appeal to a wider demographic, scenes were changed slightly, to lower the number of casualties seen throughout the show.</p>

<dd>The focus character of both the anime and the manga is Speed Racer, originally Gō Mifune.<sup id="cite_ref-tatsunoko.co.jp_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-tatsunoko.co.jp-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>. He is known for his love of racing and values his family. He drives the Mach 5 (as well as other cars, such as the Mach 6 in the movie) and always manages to wind up in extreme danger (such as encountering thugs, race fixers, gangs, etc.) with his younger brother or his girlfriend Trixie. Speed is shown to miss his older brother, Rex (secretly disguised as the Racer X) in both versions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Casually, he wears a blue shirt with a yellow "G" (standing for his Japanese first name, Gō) that sports a white collar, a red racing bandanna around his neck, white pants, red socks, brown loafers and yellow gloves. He has a brown Elvis <a href="/wiki/Pompadour" title="Pompadour">pompadour</a> hairstyle. In racing, he sports a white open-face helmet with an M (representing Mifune Motors) flashed on top. On special occasions, Speed wears a red <a href="/wiki/Blazer" title="Blazer">blazer</a> with a yellow "G" embroidered on. This only happens in the anime. In the manga, he wears his standard outfit on special occasions. In the live action film, he wears a white <a href="/wiki/Leather_jacket" title="Leather jacket">leather racing jacket</a> unzipped and over his classic outfit, and white pants. He wears his classic outfit (without the embroidered "G") in the first half of the Casa Cristo 5000. To strenghten character backstory between Speed and his older brother Rex, Speed's red socks were considered "lucky socks".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>According to Peter Fernandez's introduction in the American release of the Mach GoGoGo Manga, he wanted a name that everyone could remember. So he came up with "Speed Racer" a name for both the main character and the actual series itself. In the <a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer_(film)" title="Speed Racer (film)">2008 film</a>, he is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Emile_Hirsch" title="Emile Hirsch">Emile Hirsch</a> as an adult and <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Elia" title="Nicholas Elia">Nicholas Elia</a> as a child.</dd>

Six years ago, Rex had a falling out with Pops after Rex wrecked a race car that Pops had built. Pops had told Rex prior to the race that Rex was not yet prepared to compete at the professional racing level. With less than one lap to go in his first major race, Rex was leading and cruising toward victory, but lost control of the car and wrecked it. Pops exploded with anger and berated Rex. In even more enraged response, Rex fled the family and exiled himself while vowing to become the world's greatest race car driver. It was at that time that Rex assumed the mysterious, Racer X identity, to pursue his racing career. In both <i><a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer_X" title="Speed Racer X">Speed Racer X</a></i> and in the 2008 movie, however, Rex is thought to have died in that accident.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It was acknowledged by both Pops and Speed over the years that Racer X was the superior driver of the two, and the greatest driver that they had ever seen, but Speed always vowed to defeat Racer X as the two vigorously competed. In the anime, Speed was often suspicious of Racer X's identity and motives because Racer X would repeatedly, and inexplicably, sacrifice winning races to protect Speed from drivers and others who tried to harm him. The assistance from Racer X nearly always led to Speed winning races, while Racer X came in second place. Racer X always left the scene unnoticed, receding into his secret life. It was not until the episode "The Trick Race" that fans of the show finally got to see the face of Racer X. Early in the series, in the episode "Challenge of the Masked Racer," Speed had already begun to suspect that Racer X might, in fact, be his estranged older brother.</dd>

He drives the number 11 car, the only car different in appearance to the rest of the Car Acrobatic team.</dd>

<dd>In the anime, Captain Terror's character exists, but his original attitude in the manga had formed a new character for the anime, <b>Snake Oiler</b>, a hothead racer, eager to win. Embroidered with an "S" on his uniform and tinted visor on his striped helmet, Snake Oiler drives the number 12 car, similar in appearance to the other cars in the Car Acrobatic Team. The role Captain Terror had in the manga was lifted on to the Snake Oiler character, therefore Captain Terror's role in the Alpine Race was replaced with Snake. Although Snake didn't exist in the original manga, he was more notable in the West due to his appearance in the anime.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the live action movie, Snake has completely changed in appearance. He is no longer part of the Car Acrobatic Team as it never existed in the film's time line. However, in homage to the Car Acrobatic Team, Snake is leader of his own racing team, named "Hydra-Cell". He wears large <a href="/wiki/Sunglasses" title="Sunglasses">shades</a> and sports a black <a href="/wiki/Pompadour_(hairstyle)" title="Pompadour (hairstyle)">pompadour</a>. His racing uniform is made entirely of snake skin and his car is now completely orange. Despite the change in appearance, Snake's car number and attitude are still intact in the film.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Speed_Racer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Westernized Appearance of Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Westernized Appearance of Characters</span></h3>
<p>One distinct feature seen in <i>Speed Racer</i> is the Westernization of their characters' physical appearance and, to some extent, their mentality. This is partly due to Tatsuo Yoshida's affinity for the United States through portrayals of American life in numerous films. This use of Western appearance can somewhat be referred as <i>mukokuseki</i> (literally meaning, "stateless"), though the term relates to more abstract anime and is used for hyperbole in this case. In <i>Speed Racer</i>, the fair complexion and American attire can be seen as an example of <i>mukokuseki</i>, but it can take many unconventional forms.<sup id="cite_ref-Napier_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Napier-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> This can be seen more readily in later anime in the fantasy and mecha genres, where characters are given more unusual traits like unusually colored hair (pink hair, blue hair etc.), enlarged eyes, and dysmorphic humanoid bodies (such as Tetsuo and the Espers in <i><a href="/wiki/Akira_(manga)" title="Akira (manga)">Akira</a></i>). Reasons behind the presence of <i>mukokuseki</i> may be to diversify the character roster and distinguish between individuals, but it can have cultural implications.<sup id="cite_ref-Napier_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Napier-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Other aspects of physical appearance, such as disproportionally large eyes, are used to promote <i>kawaii</i>, or “cuteness”, as seen in many <i><a href="/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo" title="Shōjo">shōjo</a></i> anime. It has even been implied that the large eyes could have its roots in early influences from older cartoon characters like <a href="/wiki/Mickey_Mouse" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and <a href="/wiki/Felix_the_Cat" title="Felix the Cat">Felix the Cat</a>.</p>
<p>Despite their Westernization, the series falls into the familiar manga-anime storyline, which is a form of Japanese expression.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Speed Racer</i> embodies the typical manga characterization of a teenage boy with superior skills (in this case, racing skills) facing unreal adversity through a multitude of villains; this is seen more in mecha anime such as <i><a href="/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam" title="Mobile Suit Gundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion" title="Neon Genesis Evangelion" class="mw-redirect">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></i>. Though always doing his best, he frequently receives a helping hand from his virtually superior brother (Racer X) when he falls short of his goals. This kind of continuing support can easily be identified in the episode “Challenge of the Masked Racer”. Another persistent manga component is the overreactions of many characters. The long, drawn out dialogues with no pauses are very distinct in <i>Speed Racer</i>, from Pops speaking his mind to Ace Deucey's thugs in "The Great Plan" to Racer X’s monologue of his thoughts to Speed after crashing in "Challenge of the Masked Racer."</p>

<p>Many of the show's cars are shown to have special abilities in the series, which is one element of the show's glory and legacy. Some cars (especially Speed's Mach 5) have made a great impact to many viewers of the show and are notable to most of the series' fans.</p>

<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Mach_5" title="Mach 5" class="mw-redirect">Mach 5</a></div>
<p>The Mach 5, the car Speed Racer drove in the series (known as the "Mach Go," or simply the "Mach," in the Japanese version), is a technological marvel, containing useful pieces of equipment. Gō Mifune/Speed Racer easily deployed these gadgets by pressing buttons marked "A" through "G" on the steering wheel hub (it should be noted that although there are buttons on the steering wheel in the manga, the letter designations are exclusive to the anime). This uniquely designed car, built on a sleek, white <a href="/wiki/Car_body" title="Car body" class="mw-redirect">body</a> has a large "M" on its hood, the logo for the family business, Mifune Motors (Changed to Pops Motors in the anime and Racer Motors in the live action film). The two-seat car's uniqueness also derives from its mostly red colored interior.</p>
<p>A "5" is emblazoned on both side doors of the car. In the manga and anime this is the car's racing number; in the film, it is portrayed as the fifth car built in Pops' "Mach" series of racing vehicles. Although technically inferior to other racing vehicles such as the Mammoth Car and the GRX, the Mach 5 manages to win most races because of Speed's superior driving skill.</p>
<p>The Mach 5 had been stolen from Speed a few times, one of which where Cornpone Blotch took the car to add it to his car collection in the "Girl Daredevil" saga. However, Speed usually manages to get it back at the end of the episode. At one point, the car was replicated, designs, functions and all, by <i>Speed Racer</i> baddie, Dr. Nightcall. However, this replica included other new abilities that would inspire later functions of the car in remakes of the show, one of which were the Aero Jacks, used as a replacement for the Auto Jacks in <a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer_X" title="Speed Racer X">Speed Racer X</a>. In manga continuity, the Mach 5 was destroyed and rebuilt. One of its new functions also included the Aero-Jacks. See <i><b>Manga and Anime Differences</b></i> for more information on the Mach 5's manga continuity.</p>
<p>In both American comic and movie continuity, Pops is portrayed as having built a "Mach" Series consisting of other variants such as the Mach 4 and Mach 6 in addition to Rex Racer's Mach 1 and the Mach 5.</p>

The Mysterious Racer X and his vehicle, the Shooting Star.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Shooting Star is <a href="/wiki/Racer_X_(Speed_Racer_character)" title="Racer X (Speed Racer character)">Racer X</a>'s car, colored bright yellow with a black front bumper and numbered 9 on the hood and sides. The car's engine is located in the back, and it is a very agile machine, often displaying abilities akin to and above those of the <a href="/wiki/Mach_Five" title="Mach Five">Mach Five</a>. Many of its high-tech features allowed Racer X keep an eye on Speed Racer, who is his younger brother.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In later comics written by <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Yune" title="Tommy Yune">Tommy Yune</a>, Rex acquires the car that he names "Shooting Star" from Prince Kabala of Kapetapek. During his time training with the royal leader, Rex is informed that he is the ninth student of Kabala, hence the number 9. Rex also builds other cars numbered 9 with similar paint schemes and names them variants like "Falling Star".</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer_(film)" title="Speed Racer (film)">2008 film</a> adaptation, the car makes an appearance but is not named. The car was the only car built in addition to the Mach Five for the movie, and features weapons like machine guns mounted above the cockpit and under the chassis. In addition to this car, Racer X also drives a car built for the competitions in the film, a T180. This car was entitled the "Augury" in the film's video game counterpart. Like Racer X's unnamed street car, it features a number 9 and is colored schemed black and yellow, with a large black "X" on the front bumper. The T180 only makes one appearance in the film, when Racer X competes to protect Speed in the Fuji race after he has rejected Royalton's offer.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Speed_Racer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16" title="Edit section: The Mammoth Car">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Mammoth Car</span></h3>
<p>Appearing only in the anime, it is supposedly the largest racing vehicle in the world. Designed after an extremely long trailer truck, the Mammoth Car is mostly red and is built by infamous Speed Racer villain Cruncher Block. The Mammoth Car was built almost entirely of $50,000,000 in stolen gold bars. By entering it in 'The No Limit World Race', Cruncher wished to smuggle the gold out of the country. The Mammoth Car's main engine has 7,500&#160;horsepower (5,600&#160;kW). Each wheel also has an engine with 1,500&#160;horsepower (1,100&#160;kW). In total, the Mammoth Car is run by 30,000&#160;horsepower (22,000&#160;kW). It can travel at 500&#160;mph (800&#160;km/h), on any kind of road and on any kind of terrain. It has magnetic brakes, and is over 200&#160;yards (180&#160;m) long, making the Mammoth Car one of the most interesting cars in the series. It was destroyed after it crashed into an oil refinery and it was melted into its original gold compound by the intense heat.</p>
<p>The Mammoth Car makes a small cameo in the <a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer_(film)" title="Speed Racer (film)">2008 film</a> in the scene where Cruncher Block interrogates Taejo Togokhan (a character created just for the movie) after he resists Royalton Industries in the race fixing business. They were interrupted by Racer X, who battles the Mammoth and saves Taejo. The Mammoth Car in this movie is shown to have view ports for its drivers to shoot out of, just like in the original series, and is shown to fire missiles from its grill.</p>
<p>The Mammoth Car also makes an appearance along with Flash Marker Jr.'s X3 in <i><a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer:_The_Next_Generation" title="Speed Racer: The Next Generation">Speed Racer: The Next Generation</a></i> in the second and third episodes of "The Fast Track" saga as an enemy program of the show's virtual racing track. Although the Mammoth Car is rendered in CGI after its original anime design, the car is missing its grill and many other details that had appeared in the original anime. The Mammoth Car in this episode makes the same sound as it did in the anime, made when its headlights were turned on. It pays homage to the original series by using its signature attack of surrounding and circling a rival.</p>
<p><a name="The_Melange_and_the_X3" id="The_Melange_and_the_X3"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Speed_Racer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17" title="Edit section: The Melange and the X3">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Melange and the X3</i></span></h3>
<p>The Melange was a topless racing car numbered with a "3" driven by racer Flash Marker. When investigating the mysterious car, Speed recalls the name Melange was the name of <a href="/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte" title="Napoleon Bonaparte" class="mw-redirect">Napoleon's</a> horse, who saved his life several times in battles (actually named <a href="/wiki/Marengo_(horse)" title="Marengo (horse)">Marengo</a>, but due to the Japanese interpretation of the French word, the name "Melange" was translated). Pops Racer, however, identified the name "Melange" as a car driven fifteen years earlier by a young driver named Flash Marker. The Melange's chassis was colored with two shades of purple and had an exposed engine on its hood. During the 'Race at Danger Pass', The Melange, along with Marker, was fatally crashed by members of the <i>Three Roses Club</i>.</p>
<p>Since then, Flash's son, Flash Marker Jr, had plotted his revenge on the Three Roses Club by building a car with a sleek, black body marked "X3". The car was driven through remote control and a robot dummy was placed in the driver's seat, broadcasting the phrases "<i>Melange Still Races</i>" and "<i>Melange is alive</i>" to haunt those of the Three Roses Club. The X3 was used primarily to deliberately crash into and fatally kill those affiliated with the Three Roses Club, leaving a card marked X3 to haunt other Three Roses Club members who haven't been killed yet. Speed, who had volunteered to help the police, chased down the X3 until it crashed into the guard rail of a train track.</p>
<p>Speed noticed its robot “driver” and brings it back to the police for further investigation. Meanwhile, Flash Marker Jr. secretly brought back the wrecked car from the train track and replaced its body with a replica of the original Melange, placing it over the X3 chassis in his secret underground car factory, to prepare for the next Race at Danger Pass. Since it is the same car with the chassis of the Melange, the car can still be controlled remotely. The new Melange is still numbered “3”, but it has the ability to be changed through remote control to “X3”, making the drivers of the Three Roses Club realize that the "new Melange" is actually the X3. The car, "driven" by Flash Jr.'s sister, Lily and controlled by Flash Jr. in his helicopter, was used to fatally crash into two Three Roses drivers until it was destroyed when it lost control and crashed into the final member of the Three Roses Club.</p>
<p>The X3 makes a cameo along with the Mammoth Car in <i><a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer:_The_Next_Generation" title="Speed Racer: The Next Generation">Speed Racer: The Next Generation</a></i> as an enemy program of the virtual track. The car has the same design as the original X3, but rendered in CGI form, as with all the other cars in the show's racing sequences. It pays homage to the original anime by making the same beeping sound used in the old series.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Speed_Racer&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18" title="Edit section: The GRX">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The GRX</span></h3>
<p>The GRX was technically an engine, but it has become more identified with the gold-colored car that housed the engine in the series episode "The Fastest Car on Earth." The engine was designed by Ben Cranem, and was responsible for crashes and deaths of four test drivers, including its inventor due to the impossible speeds it could attain. Cranem died and the GRX engine was buried with him, but Oriana Flub and her men retrieved the engine and placed it into the car with a sleek, golden, and markless <a href="/wiki/Car_body" title="Car body" class="mw-redirect">body</a>.</p>
<p>Oriana convinced Speed to test drive the car with the GRX and Speed was sprayed with a special serum known as the V-gas to artificially sharpen his reflexes. The V-gas causes its driver to become extremely thirsty and if the driver consumed any compound containing water, it would tamper with his mentality and would develop a strong phobia of speed. Like the other test drivers who were given the gas, Speed became scared of even the slowest of speeds. However he regains his love of racing due to Pops' help in the race that followed. By then, the car had a new driver, Cranem's son, Curly. Curly was given the V-gas and soon experienced its side effects. The GRX and its engine were destroyed when he fatally crashed the car due to the side effects of the V-gas.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Speed_Racer_(film)" title="Speed Racer (film)">2008 film</a> adaptation, the name makes an appearance as a car developed by Royalton Industries and driven by Jack "Cannonball" Taylor. The car retains none of the back story from its anime counterpart, and is redesigned into the racing competition of the film. It is numbered 66 and colored brown and gold and was transformed from a two-seater to a single-seater. In the Grand Prix race that closes the film, the GRX is the main competitor for Speed in the Mach 6 and features a secret weapon called a "spear-hook" that is illegal in professional racing. After Taylor deploys the device against Speed during the Grand Prix, Speed uses the Mach 6's auto-jacks to flip the cars and reveal the hook to the track cameras, automatically disqualifying Taylor and aiding the case built by Inspector Detector against Royalton.</p>

<p>Like most manga series that have been adapted to anime, there are several changes that occur in both timelines of the Speed Racer (Mach GoGoGo) series. Besides the obvious Americanization of the original Japanese characters' names, some changes include a change in a character's backstory, new characters and other information that was never seen in both the anime and the manga.

<ul>
<li>Most of the stories from the manga that were adapted to the anime were given slight changes. Differences between both versions of each story either included a different change of events, or new events seen only in the manga. There are also stories never adapted into the anime series, thus making them manga exclusives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the manga, Speed (Go Mifune) always wears his standard outfit, even on special occasions. In the case of the anime, however, Speed wears a special outfit, exclusive to formal occasions. The same instance goes for Trixie.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The meeting between Spritle (Kurio), and Racer X occurs twice (once in each volume) in the manga along with other scenes preceding and following it. However, several dialogue changes are present and the outcome of each meeting is extremely different. The outcome of the first occurrence follows closely to "The Most Dangerous Race" saga of the anime. The outcome of the second occurrence between the two follows more closely to the "Challenge of the Masked Racer" saga in the anime.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The manga has a dramatically different ending from the anime. In the manga, Rex Racer (Kenichi Mifune), reunites with Speed revealing to him that he was the mysterious Masked Racer, Racer X. In the "The Trick Race," Speed confronts him asking if he is his older brother, prompting Rex (as Racer X) to punch him in the stomach, knocking him out cold, then declaring that he "can never go home again". In both instances, Speed finally knows that his brother is the Masked Racer.</li>

<p>The show's mainstream success in the United States spawned an ongoing Speed Racer franchise, ranging from comics, video releases, merchandise, a live-action film, and newer series either <a href="/wiki/Reboot" title="Reboot">rebooting</a> or continuing the original series. The franchise began in the early 1990s when a company by the name of "Speed Racer Enterprises" grabbed rights to the original series. At the time when the series was originally released, very few merchandise pertaining to the series was released in the United States. However, during the series' re-airing during the 1990s, Speed Racer Enterprises was responsible for the spawning of actual Speed Racer merchandise, ranging from small collectible Die-Cast cars, action figures, and even video releases of episodes from the original series. Speed Racer Enterprises was also involved in creations of new original American takes on the original Japanese series such as <i>The New Adventures of Speed Racer</i> and the recent <i>Speed Racer: The Next Generation</i>.</p>
<p>Due to Speed Racer Enterprises, the original 1967 series made a comeback as reruns on <a href="/wiki/MTV" title="MTV">MTV</a> broadcast in the early morning hours. In 1993, the series was rebroadcast in syndication concurrently with a <a href="/wiki/The_New_Adventures_of_Speed_Racer" title="The New Adventures of Speed Racer">new American-created remake</a>. Since all the rights were now under the hand of Speed Racer Enterprises, all references to the original rights holder, Trans-Lux were removed. Therefore, the opening sequence including an entirely recreated logo which most of us are familiar with today. In addition, the title cards for each episode and closing credits were recreated (with the latter sequence including three typographical errors: <a href="/wiki/Jack_Grimes" title="Jack Grimes">Jack Grimes</a> is misspelled Jack "Crimes", <a href="/wiki/Hiroshi_Sasagawa" title="Hiroshi Sasagawa">Hiroshi Sasagawa</a> is misspelled Hiroshi "Sasacawa", and "Yomiko" is misspelled "Yumiko").</p>
<p>This is the version that later aired on the <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a> in the late afternoon (and later on in late night/overnight) programming, and is also the version released on Region 1 DVD.

<p>In 1993 an American produced series called <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Adventures_of_Speed_Racer" title="The New Adventures of Speed Racer">The New Adventures of Speed Racer</a></i> had a much more <a href="/wiki/Contemporary_art" title="Contemporary art">contemporary art</a> style.

While the original series had more realistic themes such as gang violence and family ties, this series introduced science fiction themes such as robots and mutants. The series was off the air after only 13 installments, as the show failed to arouse viewer interest. Tatsunoko did not authorize the production of this series.</p>
<p>For the original series' 40th Anniversary, a <a href="/wiki/Macromedia_Flash" title="Macromedia Flash" class="mw-redirect">Flash</a>-based series of "webisodes" entitled <i>Speed Racer Lives</i> was released.

<p><i>Speed Racer</i> was one of the first truly successful anime franchises in the United States. The pivotal episode in which Racer X reveals his identity to Speed ("The Trick Race") was selected by <i><a href="/wiki/TV_Guide" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> as one of the Top 100 TV episodes of all time.</p>
<p>Speed Racer was even introduced in a 1990s <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a> Tv intro that started with the <a href="/wiki/Scooby_Doo" title="Scooby Doo" class="mw-redirect">Scooby Doo</a> Gang and an announcer explaining about the Mystery Machine and its alloy wheels; slick paint job, and its groovy soundsystem. As Scooby drives the van, Speed Racer's Mach 5 comes in and knock the van off the track, and exploding with the "chyok chyok" noise in the background. Near the end of the hilarious crash, Speed leaps from the <a href="/wiki/Mach_5" title="Mach 5" class="mw-redirect">Mach 5</a>, he does the famous pose (from the end of the opening sequence in mid leap, and then the camera does the famous shot from front to sideways, with the announcer going, "Speed Racer, on Cartoon Network!" It ends with Speed saying to Scooby, "Dogs should not drive", as the <a href="/wiki/Scooby" title="Scooby">Scooby</a> Gang looking bewildered as to how they survived the crash. In the ad, the Speed Racer Theme is playing about ten seconds when the fabulous <a href="/wiki/Mach_5" title="Mach 5" class="mw-redirect">Mach 5</a> comes in.</p>
<p>The title character was "<a href="/wiki/Interview" title="Interview">interviewed</a>" in a humorous series of promotional ads for auto racing that ran on <a href="/wiki/ESPN" title="ESPN">ESPN</a>. The <i>Speed Racer</i> characters also appeared in an animated <a href="/wiki/Television_commercial" title="Television commercial" class="mw-redirect">television commercial</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_GTI" title="Volkswagen GTI" class="mw-redirect">Volkswagen GTI</a> in 1996.<a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20080703r1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20080703r1.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> In the ad, titled "Sabotage", Speed drives a GTI to victory after the Mach Five is disabled. The ad also incorporated the rotating freeze frame shot from the cartoon's opening sequence, with the GTI replacing the Mach Five in the shot.</p>
<p>Speed Racer was also featured in a 30-second advertisement for <a href="/wiki/GEICO_Insurance" title="GEICO Insurance" class="mw-redirect">GEICO Insurance</a> in 2004. In the ad, Speed is advised that the bridge is out ahead. That's bad news for Speed Racer, but Trixie, who transmitted the news to him from her helicopter, is more concerned with her good news about GEICO's savings, as befitting GEICO's campaign of the time. The next shot of Speed shows him dumb struck in bewildered astonishment.</p>
<p>In the 1977 film <i><a href="/wiki/Slap_Shot_(film)" title="Slap Shot (film)">Slap Shot</a>,</i> after arriving at their hotel room in Charlestown on their way to join the Charlestown Chiefs, one of the Hanson Brothers asks when <i>Speed Racer</i> is broadcast in the city. It should be known that the Hansons, when they are not playing hockey, play with toy racecars.</p>
<p>The series was also revived on <a href="/wiki/MTV" title="MTV">MTV</a> for a short period of time in 1993, then moved to <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a> in 1996, and again to its sister network <a href="/wiki/Boomerang_(TV_channel)" title="Boomerang (TV channel)">Boomerang</a> until 2005, after which it was picked up by the <a href="/wiki/SPEED_Channel" title="SPEED Channel" class="mw-redirect">SPEED Channel</a>.</p>
<p>The series was parodied in the <i><a href="/wiki/Dexter%27s_Laboratory" title="Dexter's Laboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></i> episode with a pun-intended title, <i>Mock 5.</i> It featured Dexter competing in a <a href="/wiki/Soapbox_derby" title="Soapbox derby" class="mw-redirect">soapbox derby</a> against Mandark; Dexter's father in a role much like Pops Racer, and Dee-Dee in a role very much like Racer X (as 'Racer D'). Everyone in this episode talked incredibly fast and detoured into redundant chatter, all the while having their lip movement never match their speech. A clip from <i><a href="/wiki/Robot_Chicken" title="Robot Chicken">Robot Chicken</a></i> includes a race similar to the <a href="/wiki/Hanna-Barbara" title="Hanna-Barbara" class="mw-redirect">Hanna-Barbara</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Wacky_Races" title="Wacky Races">Wacky Races</a></i> featuring several famous race characters including <i>Speed Racer,</i> the <i><a href="/wiki/Knight_Rider_(1982_TV_series)" title="Knight Rider (1982 TV series)">Knight Rider</a>,</i> <i><a href="/wiki/Mario_Kart" title="Mario Kart">Mario Kart</a>,</i> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Dukes_of_Hazzard" title="The Dukes of Hazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a>,</i> <i><a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a>,</i> and so on.

<p>Speed and his dad Pops were parodied on the episode of <i><a href="/wiki/Family_Guy" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a>,</i> "<a href="/wiki/The_Son_Also_Draws" title="The Son Also Draws">The Son Also Draws</a>." <a href="/wiki/Chris_Griffin" title="Chris Griffin">Chris Griffin</a> enters a <a href="/wiki/Soapbox_(car)" title="Soapbox (car)">soapbox</a> race held by his <a href="/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts</a> troop. When the racers line up at the starting line, Speed shows up and jumps out of a soapbox car that resembles his race car, the Mach 5. Pops comes out from the audience at the race and tries to convince Speed that he should not be in this race and that he isn't Speed's real father. In their conversation, they have purposefully bad <a href="/wiki/Lip_sync" title="Lip sync">lip sync</a>, a parody of the series, and each sentence Speed and Pops says ends in <i>"Ha ha!"</i>.</p>
<p>Speed Racer was parodied in the <i><a href="/wiki/Fairly_Oddparents" title="Fairly Oddparents" class="mw-redirect">Fairly Oddparents</a></i> animated movie, <i><a href="/wiki/Channel_Chasers" title="Channel Chasers">Channel Chasers</a>.</i> A short segment of the film featured <a href="/wiki/Timmy_Turner" title="Timmy Turner" class="mw-redirect">Timmy Turner</a> taking a role similar to Speed's. Even the car's gadgets were parodied by Timmy inserting a coin then pressing a numbered button, activating either the jumpjacks, or the "buzz saw" lasers, that and the number five is changed to a one, and the "M" on the helmet, and the car are changed to a "T". Even the title of the short segment is Speed Racer's name in reverse; Racer Speed. Most characters during this segment parodied Speed Racer's fast dialogue and added exclamations such as <i>"Hah! Hoo! Ha!"</i> to the end of their lines, in the same vein as <i>The Son Also Draws.</i></p>
<p>In the episode My Hero (season 1) of <a href="/wiki/Scrubs_(tv_series)" title="Scrubs (tv series)" class="mw-redirect">Scrubs (tv series)</a>, Ted's band sings an <a href="/wiki/A_cappella" title="A cappella">a cappella</a> version of the American theme song.</p>

In addition, this was one of the first <a href="/wiki/Anime_music_video" title="Anime music video">anime music videos</a> ever made, and the first AMV to be shown on a TV channel.</p>
<p>The Nicktoon <i><a href="/wiki/Kappa_Mikey" title="Kappa Mikey">Kappa Mikey</a></i> had a minor recurring character, a fat, middle-aged version of Speed, who appeared in the pilot episode and every opening sequence. Here, he was a <a href="/wiki/Limousine" title="Limousine">limousine</a> driver who would escort the main cast to wherever they needed to go.

<p>One of the most memorable parts of the anime, is the shot at the end of the title sequence for: as Speed leaps from the <a href="/wiki/Mach_5" title="Mach 5" class="mw-redirect">Mach 5</a>, he freezes in mid-jump, and then the camera does an arc shot from front to sideways.

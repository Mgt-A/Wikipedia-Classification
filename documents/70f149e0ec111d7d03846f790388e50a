<p>Welles was born May 6, 1915, in <a href="/wiki/Kenosha" title="Kenosha" class="mw-redirect">Kenosha</a>, Wisconsin and was brought up a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a>. He had <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">English</a> ancestry. Despite his parents' affluence, Welles encountered many hardships in childhood. In 1919, his parents separated and moved to <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and his father became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother died of <a href="/wiki/Jaundice" title="Jaundice">jaundice</a> on May 10, 1924, in a Chicago hospital, four days after Welles's ninth birthday. After his mother's death, Welles ceased pursuing his interest in music. Richard Welles died when Orson was 15 - the summer after Orson's graduation from the <a href="/wiki/Todd_School_for_Boys" title="Todd School for Boys" class="mw-redirect">Todd School for Boys</a> in <a href="/wiki/Woodstock,_Illinois" title="Woodstock, Illinois">Woodstock, Illinois</a> - whereupon Maurice Bernstein, a Russian-born physician from Chicago, became his guardian.</p>
<p>At Todd, Welles came under the positive influence and guidance of Roger Hill, a teacher who later became Todd's headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an 'ad hoc' educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged his first theatrical experiments and productions there.</p>
<p>On his father's death, Welles traveled to <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> with the aid of a small inheritance. While on a walking and painting trip through <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, he strode into the <a href="/wiki/Gate_Theatre" title="Gate Theatre">Gate Theatre</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> and claimed he was a Broadway star. Gate manager <a href="/wiki/Hilton_Edwards" title="Hilton Edwards">Hilton Edwards</a> later claimed he didn't believe him but was impressed by his brashness and some impassioned quality in his audition. Welles made his stage debut at the Gate in 1931, appearing in <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Jud_S%C3%BC%C3%9F_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jud Süß (play) (page does not exist)">Jew Suss</a></i> as the Duke. He acted to great acclaim, acclaim that reached the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. He performed smaller supporting roles as well. On returning to the United States he found his brief fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd that would become the immensely successful <i>Everybody's Shakespeare</i>, and subsequently, <i>The Mercury Shakespeare</i>. Welles traveled to North Africa while working on thousands of illustrations for the <i>Everybody's Shakespeare</i> series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.</p>
<p>An introduction by <a href="/wiki/Thornton_Wilder" title="Thornton Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a> led Welles to the New York stage. He toured in three off-Broadway productions with <a href="/wiki/Katharine_Cornell" title="Katharine Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a>'s company. Restless and impatient when the planned Broadway opening of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was canceled, Welles staged a drama festival of his own with the Todd School, inviting <a href="/wiki/Miche%C3%A1l_MacL%C3%ADamm%C3%B3ir" title="Micheál MacLíammóir">Micheál MacLíammóir</a> and Hilton Edwards from Dublin's Gate Theatre to appear, along with New York stage luminaries. It was a roaring success. The subsequent revival of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> brought Welles to the notice of <a href="/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a>, who was then casting for an unusual lead actor and about to take a lead role in the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project" title="Federal Theatre Project">Federal Theatre Project</a>.</p>
<p>By 1935 Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theater as a radio actor in New York City, working with many of the actors who would later form the core of his <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">Mercury Theatre</a>. He married actress and socialite Virginia Nicholson in 1934. They had one daughter, Christopher, who became known as Chris Welles Feder, an author of educational materials for children. Welles also shot an eight-minute silent short film, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Hearts_of_Age" title="The Hearts of Age">The Hearts of Age</a></i> with Nicholson.</p>

<p>In 1936, the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project" title="Federal Theatre Project">Federal Theatre Project</a> (part of <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt" class="mw-redirect">Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration" title="Works Progress Administration">Works Progress Administration</a>) put unemployed theatre performers and employees to work.

<p>After the success of <i>Macbeth</i>, Welles mounted the absurd farce <i>Horse Eats Hat</i>. He consolidated his "White Hope" reputation with <i>Dr Faustus</i>. This was even more ground-breaking theatre than <i>Macbeth</i>, using light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly blacked-out stage. In 1937, he rehearsed <a href="/wiki/Marc_Blitzstein" title="Marc Blitzstein">Marc Blitzstein</a>'s pro-union "labour opera" <i><a href="/wiki/The_Cradle_Will_Rock" title="The Cradle Will Rock">The Cradle Will Rock</a></i>. Because of severe federal cutbacks and perhaps rumoured Congressional worries about communist propaganda in the Federal Theatre, the show's premiere at the <a href="/wiki/Maxine_Elliott_Theatre" title="Maxine Elliott Theatre">Maxine Elliott Theatre</a> was cancelled and the theatre locked and guarded by National Guardsmen. In a last-minute theatrical coup Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to <a href="/wiki/New_Century_Theatre" title="New Century Theatre">the Venice</a>, about twenty blocks away. Cast, crew and audience walked the distance on foot. Since the unions forbade the actors and musicians performing from the stage, <i>The Cradle Will Rock</i> began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage, with the cast performing their parts from the audience. This impromptu performance was a tremendous hit.</p>
<p>Resigning from the Federal Theatre, Welles and Houseman formed their own company, the <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">Mercury Theatre</a>, which included actors such as <a href="/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ray_Collins_(actor)" title="Ray Collins (actor)">Ray Collins</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Coulouris" title="George Coulouris">George Coulouris</a>, Frank Readick, <a href="/wiki/Everett_Sloane" title="Everett Sloane">Everett Sloane</a>, Eustace Wyatt and Erskine Sanford, all of whom would continue to work for Welles for years. The first Mercury Theatre production was a melodramatic and heavily edited version of Shakespeare's <i><a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)" title="Julius Caesar (play)">Julius Caesar</a></i>, set in a contemporary frame of fascist Italy. Cinna the Poet dies at the hands not of a mob but a secret police force. According to <a href="/wiki/Norman_Lloyd" title="Norman Lloyd">Norman Lloyd</a>, who played Cinna, "it stopped the show". The applause lasted more than 3 minutes and the production was widely acclaimed.</p>
<p>Welles was increasingly active on radio, as an actor and soon as a director and producer. He played <a href="/wiki/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a> for <a href="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> on <a href="/wiki/CBS_Radio_Workshop" title="CBS Radio Workshop">The Columbia Workshop</a>, adapting and directing the play himself. The <a href="/wiki/Mutual_Network" title="Mutual Network" class="mw-redirect">Mutual Network</a> gave him a seven-week series to adapt <i><a href="/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables" title="Les Misérables">Les Misérables</a></i>, which he did with great success. Welles was chosen to anonymously play Lamont Cranston, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Shadow" title="The Shadow">The Shadow</a></i>, in late 1937 (again for Mutual) and in the summer of 1938 CBS gave him (and the Mercury Theatre) a weekly hour-long show to broadcast radio plays based on classic literary works. The show was titled <i><a href="/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">The Mercury Theatre on the Air</a></i>, with original music by <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>, who would continue working with Welles on radio and in films for years.</p>
<p>Their October 30 broadcast, <a href="/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio)" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">The War of the Worlds</a></i>, brought Welles notoriety and instant fame on both a national and international level. The fortuitous mixture of news bulletin format with the between-breaks dial spinning habits of listeners from the rival and far more popular <i><a href="/wiki/Edgar_Bergen" title="Edgar Bergen">Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy program</a></i>, created widespread confusion among late tuners. Panic spread among many listeners who believed the news reports of an actual Martian invasion. The resulting panic was duly reported around the world and disparagingly mentioned by <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in a public speech a few months later.<sup id="cite_ref-hand_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hand-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Welles's growing fame soon drew Hollywood offers, lures which the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. However, <i>The Mercury Theatre on the Air</i>, which had been a "sustaining show" (without sponsorship) was picked up by <a href="/wiki/Campbell_Soup_Company" title="Campbell Soup Company">Campbell Soup</a> and renamed <i><a href="/wiki/The_Campbell_Playhouse" title="The Campbell Playhouse">The Campbell Playhouse</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Orson_Welles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Welles in Hollywood (1939 to 1948)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Welles in Hollywood (1939 to 1948)</span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> president <a href="/wiki/George_Schaefer_(film_producer)" title="George Schaefer (film producer)">George Schaefer</a> eventually offered Welles what is generally considered the greatest contract ever offered to an untried director: complete artistic control. RKO signed Welles in a two-picture deal; including script, cast, crew, and most important, final cut, though Welles had a budget limit for his projects. With this contract in hand, Welles (and nearly the entire Mercury Theatre) moved to <a href="/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood" class="mw-redirect">Hollywood</a>. He commuted weekly to New York to maintain his commitment to <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i>.</p>
<p>Welles toyed with various ideas for his first project for <a href="/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO Pictures</a>, settling on an adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Conrad" title="Joseph Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness" title="Heart of Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a></i>, which he worked on in great detail. He planned to film the action with a subjective camera from the protagonist's point of view. When a budget was drawn up, RKO's enthusiasm cooled, as it was greater than the previously agreed limit. RKO also declined to approve another Welles project, <i>The Smiler with the Knife</i> ostensibly because they lacked faith in <a href="/wiki/Lucille_Ball" title="Lucille Ball">Lucille Ball</a>'s ability to carry the leading lady role.</p>
<p>In a sign of things to come, Welles left <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i> in 1940, due to creative differences with the sponsor. The show continued without him, produced by John Houseman. In perhaps another sign of things to come, Welles's first actual experience on a Hollywood film was as narrator for RKO's 1940 production of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Swiss_Family_Robinson" title="The Swiss Family Robinson">The Swiss Family Robinson</a></i>.</p>
<p>Welles found a suitable film project in an idea he conceived with screenwriter <a href="/wiki/Herman_J._Mankiewicz" title="Herman J. Mankiewicz">Herman J. Mankiewicz</a> (who was then writing radio plays for <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i>). Initially called <i>American</i>, it would eventually become Welles's first feature film (also his most famous and honored role), <i><a href="/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i> (1941).</p>
<p>Mankiewicz based his original notion on an <i>exposé</i> of the life of <a href="/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, whom he knew socially but now hated, having once been great friends with Hearst's mistress, <a href="/wiki/Marion_Davies" title="Marion Davies">Marion Davies</a>. Mankiewicz was now banished from her company because of his perpetual drunkenness. Mankiewicz, a notorious gossip, exacted revenge with his unflattering depiction of Davies in <i>Citizen Kane</i> for which Welles got most of the criticisms; Welles also had a connection with Davies through his first wife. Kane's megalomaniac personality was also loosely modeled on <a href="/wiki/Robert_R._McCormick" title="Robert R. McCormick">Robert McCormick</a>, <a href="/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Pulitzer" title="Joseph Pulitzer">Joseph Pulitzer</a>, as Welles wanted to create a broad, complex character, intending to show him in the same scenes from several points of view. The use of multiple narrative perspectives in Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i> also influenced the treatment. Supplying Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes, Welles urged him to write the first draft of a screenplay under the watchful nursing of John Houseman, who was posted to ensure Mankiewicz stayed sober. On Welles's instruction, Houseman wrote the opening narration as a pastiche of <i><a href="/wiki/The_March_of_Time" title="The March of Time">The March of Time</a></i> newsreels. Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own.</p>
<p>The resulting character of Charles Foster Kane is loosely based on parts of Hearst's life. Nonetheless, autobiographical allusions to Welles himself were worked in, most noticeably in the treatment of Kane's childhood, particularly regarding his guardianship. Welles then added features from other famous American lives to create a general and mysterious personality rather than the narrow journalistic portrait intended by Mankiewicz, whose first drafts included scandalous claims about the death of the film director <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Ince" title="Thomas Ince" class="mw-redirect">Thomas Ince</a>.</p>
<p>Once the script was completed, Welles attracted some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer <a href="/wiki/Gregg_Toland" title="Gregg Toland">Gregg Toland</a>, who walked into Welles's office and announced he wanted to work on the picture. For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. He invited suggestions from everyone, but only if they were directed through him.</p>
<p>Mankiewicz handed a copy of the final shooting script to his friend, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lederer" title="Charles Lederer">Charles Lederer</a>, now husband of Welles's ex-wife Virginia Nicholson and nephew of Hearst's mistress Marion Davies. <a href="/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a> saw a small ad in a newspaper for a preview screening of <i>Citizen Kane</i> and went. Hopper, realizing immediately that the film was based on features of Hearst's life, reported this back to him and threatened to give "Hollywood, Private Lives" if that was what it wanted. Thus began the struggle over the attempted suppression of <i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p>
<p>Hearst's media outlets boycotted the film. It exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community by threatening to expose 15 years of suppressed scandals and the fact that most of the studio bosses were Jewish. At one point, the heads of the major studios jointly offered RKO the cost of the film in exchange for the negative and all existing prints, for the express purpose of burning it. RKO declined, and the film was given a limited release. Meanwhile, Hearst successfully intimidated theatre chains by threatening to ban advertising for any of their other films in any of his papers if they showed <i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p>
<p>While the film was critically well-received, by the time it reached the general public the positive tide of publicity had waned. It garnered nine Academy Award nominations, but won only for Best Original Screenplay, shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. The delay in its release and its uneven distribution contributed to its average result at the box-office, making back its budget and marketing, but RKO lost any chance of a major profit. The fact that <i>Citizen Kane</i> ignored many Hollywood conventions also meant that the film confused and angered the 1940s cinema public. Exhibitor response was scathing; most theater owners complained bitterly about the adverse audience reaction and the many walkouts, and only a few saw fit to acknowledge Welles's artistic technique. RKO shelved the film and did not re-release it until 1956. During the 1950s, the film came to be seen by young French film critics such as <a href="/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="François Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> as exemplifying the "auteur theory", in which the director is the "author" of a film. Truffaut, <a href="/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Godard</a> and others were inspired by Welles's example to make their own films, giving birth to the <a href="/wiki/Nouvelle_Vague" title="Nouvelle Vague" class="mw-redirect">Nouvelle Vague</a>. In the 1960s <i>Citizen Kane</i> became popular on college campuses, both as a film-study exercise and as an entertainment subject. Its frequent revivals on television, home video, and DVD have enhanced its "classic" status, and it ultimately recouped its costs.</p>
<p>The 1996 documentary <i><a href="/wiki/The_Battle_Over_Citizen_Kane" title="The Battle Over Citizen Kane">The Battle Over Citizen Kane</a></i> chronicles the battle between Welles and Hearst. In 1999, <i><a href="/wiki/RKO_281" title="RKO 281">RKO 281</a></i>, an <a href="/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</a> docudrama, tells the story of the making of <i>Citizen Kane</i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Liev_Schreiber" title="Liev Schreiber">Liev Schreiber</a> as Orson Welles.</p>

<p>Welles's second film for RKO was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Magnificent_Ambersons_(film)" title="The Magnificent Ambersons (film)">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></i>, adapted from the <a href="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning <a href="/wiki/The_Magnificent_Ambersons" title="The Magnificent Ambersons">novel</a> by <a href="/wiki/Booth_Tarkington" title="Booth Tarkington">Booth Tarkington</a>. George Schaefer hoped to make back the money lost by <i>Citizen Kane</i>. <i>Ambersons</i> had already been adapted for <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i> by Welles, who wrote the screen adaptation himself. Toland was not available, so <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Cortez" title="Stanley Cortez">Stanley Cortez</a> was named cinematographer. The meticulous Cortez, however, was slow and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. Prior to productions, Welles' contract was renegotiated, revoking his right to control the final cut.</p>
<p>At RKO's request, simultaneously, Welles worked on an adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Eric_Ambler" title="Eric Ambler">Eric Ambler</a>'s spy thriller, <i><a href="/wiki/Journey_into_Fear_(1943_film)" title="Journey into Fear (1943 film)">Journey into Fear</a></i>, which he co-wrote with <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>. In addition to acting in the film, Welles was also producer. Direction was credited solely to <a href="/wiki/Norman_Foster_(director)" title="Norman Foster (director)">Norman Foster</a>. Welles later stated that they were in such a rush that the director of each scene was whoever was closest to the camera.</p>
<p>Welles was then offered a new radio series by CBS. Called <i><a href="/wiki/The_Orson_Welles_Show" title="The Orson Welles Show">The Orson Welles Show</a></i>, it was a half-hour variety show of short stories, comedy skits, poetry and musical numbers. Joining the original Mercury Theatre cast was <a href="/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket" title="Jiminy Cricket">Jiminy Cricket</a>, "on loan from <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>". The variety format was unpopular with the listeners, and Welles was soon forced into full half-hour stories instead. To further complicate matters during the production of <i>Ambersons</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Journey_into_Fear_(film)" title="Journey into Fear (film)" class="mw-redirect">Journey into Fear</a></i>, Welles was approached by <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jock_Whitney" title="Jock Whitney" class="mw-redirect">Jock Whitney</a> to produce a <a href="/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentary film</a> about South America. This was at the behest of the federal government's <a href="/wiki/Good_Neighbor_policy" title="Good Neighbor policy">Good Neighbor policy</a>, a wartime propaganda effort designed to prevent <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> from allying with the <a href="/wiki/Axis_powers" title="Axis powers">Axis powers</a>. Welles saw his involvement as a form of national service, because his physical condition excused him from direct military service.</p>
<p>Expected to film the <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Carnival" title="Brazilian Carnival">Carnaval</a> in <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, Brazil, Welles rushed to finish the editing on <i>Ambersons</i> and his acting scenes in <i>Journey into Fear</i>. Ending his CBS radio show, he lashed together a rough cut of <i>Ambersons</i> with <a href="/wiki/Robert_Wise" title="Robert Wise">Robert Wise</a>, who had edited <i>Citizen Kane</i>, and left for Brazil. Wise was to join him in Rio to complete the film but never arrived. A provisional final cut arranged via phone call, telegram, and shortwave radio was previewed without Welles's approval in <a href="/wiki/Pomona" title="Pomona">Pomona</a> in a double bill, to a mostly negative audience response, in particular to the character of Aunt Fanny played by Agnes Moorehead. Whereas Schaefer argued that Welles be allowed to complete his own version of the film, and that an archival copy be kept with the <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in New York City, RKO disagreed. With Welles in South America, there was no practical means of having him edit the film.</p>
<p>Major changes occurred at RKO in 1942. <a href="/wiki/Floyd_Odlum" title="Floyd Odlum">Floyd Odlum</a> took over control of the studio and began changing its direction. Rockefeller, the most significant backer of the Brazil project, left the RKO board of directors. Around the same time, the principal sponsor of Welles at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. The changes throughout RKO caused reevaluations of many projects. RKO took control of <i>Ambersons</i>, formed a committee which was ordered to edit the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. They removed fifty minutes of Welles's footage, re-shot sequences, rearranged the scene order, and added a new happy ending. Koerner released the shortened film on the bottom of a double-bill with the <a href="/wiki/Lupe_V%C3%A9lez" title="Lupe Vélez">Lupe Vélez</a> comedy <i>Mexican Spitfire Sees a Ghost</i>. <i>Ambersons</i> was an expensive flop for RKO, though it received four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for <a href="/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>.</p>
<p>Welles's South American documentary, titled <i><a href="/wiki/It%27s_All_True_(1942_film)" title="It's All True (1942 film)">It's All True</a></i>, budgeted at one million dollars with half of its budget coming from the U.S. Government upon completion, grew in ambition and budget while Welles was in South America. While the film was originally to be a documentary on <a href="/wiki/Brazilian_Carnival" title="Brazilian Carnival">Carnaval</a>, Welles added a new story which recreated the journey of the <i>jangadeiros</i>, four poor fishermen who had made a 1,500-mile (2,400&#160;km) journey on their open raft to petition Brazilian President Vargas about their working conditions. The four had become national folk heroes; Welles first read of their journey in <i><a href="/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i>. Their leader, Jacare, died during a filming mishap. RKO, in limited contact with Welles, attempted to rein in the production. Most of the crew and budget were withdrawn from the film. In addition, the Mercury staff was removed from the studio in the US.</p>
<p>Welles requested resources to finish the film. He was given a limited amount of black-and-white stock and a silent camera. He completed the sequence, but RKO refused to support any further production on the film. Surviving footage was released in 1993, including a rough reconstruction of the Four Men on a Raft segment. Meanwhile, RKO asserted in public that Welles had gone to Brazil without a screenplay and that he had squandered a million dollars. Their official company slogan for the next year was "Showmanship in place of Genius" which was taken as a slight against Welles.</p>
<p>On returning to Hollywood, Welles found no studios interested in hiring him as a film director after the twin disasters of <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> and <i>It's All True</i>. Welles afterward worked on radio. CBS offered him two weekly series, <i>Hello Americans</i>, based on the research he'd done in Brazil, and <i>Ceiling Unlimited</i>, sponsored by <a href="/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation" title="Lockheed Corporation" class="mw-redirect">Lockheed</a>, a wartime salute to advances in aviation. Both featured several members of his original Mercury Theatre. Within a few months, <i>Hello Americans</i> was canceled and Welles was replaced as host of <i>Ceiling Unlimited</i> by Joseph Cotten. Welles guest-starred on a great variety of shows, notably guest-hosting <a href="/wiki/Jack_Benny" title="Jack Benny">Jack Benny</a>'s show for a month in 1943. He took an increasingly active role in American and international politics and used journalism to communicate his forceful ideas widely.</p>
<p>In 1943, Welles married <a href="/wiki/Rita_Hayworth" title="Rita Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a>. They had one child, <a href="/wiki/Rebecca_Welles" title="Rebecca Welles">Rebecca Welles</a>, and divorced five years later in 1948. In between, Welles found work as an actor in other directors' films. He starred in the 1943 film adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/Jane_Eyre_(1944_film)" title="Jane Eyre (1944 film)">Jane Eyre</a></i>, trading credit as associate producer for top billing over <a href="/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>. He also had a cameo in the 1944 wartime salute <i><a href="/wiki/Follow_the_Boys" title="Follow the Boys">Follow the Boys</a></i>, in which he performed his <i>Mercury Wonder Show</i> magic act and sawed <a href="/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich" title="Marlene Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> in half after <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> head <a href="/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> refused to allow Hayworth to perform.</p>
<p>In 1944, Welles was offered a new radio show, broadcast only in California. <i>Orson Welles's Almanac</i> was another half-hour variety show, with <a href="/wiki/Mobil_Oil" title="Mobil Oil" class="mw-redirect">Mobil Oil</a> as sponsor. After the success of his stand-in hosting on <i>The Jack Benny Show</i>, the focus was primarily on comedy. His hosting on Jack Benny included several self-deprecating jokes and story lines about his being a "genius" and overriding any ideas advanced by other cast members. The trade papers were not eager to accept Welles as a comedian, and Welles often complained on-air about the poor quality of the scripts. When Welles started his <i>Mercury Wonder Show</i> a few months later, traveling to <a href="/wiki/Armed_Forces" title="Armed Forces" class="mw-redirect">Armed Forces</a> camps and performing magic tricks and doing comedy, the radio show was broadcast live from the camps and the material took a decidedly wartime flavor. Of his original Mercury actors, only Agnes Moorehead was left. The series was cancelled by year's end due to poor ratings.</p>
<p>While he found no studio willing to hire him as a film director, Welles's popularity as an actor continued. <a href="/wiki/Pabst_Blue_Ribbon" title="Pabst Blue Ribbon" class="mw-redirect">Pabst Blue Ribbon</a> gave Welles their radio series <i>This Is My Best</i> to direct, but after one month he was fired for creative differences. He started writing a political column for the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i>, again called <i>Orson Welles Almanac</i>. While the paper wanted Welles to write about Hollywood gossip, Welles explored serious political issues. His activism for world peace took considerable amounts of his time. The <i>Post</i> column eventually failed in syndication because of contradictory expectations and was dropped by the <i>Post</i>.</p>

<p>In 1946, International Pictures released Welles's film <i><a href="/wiki/The_Stranger_(film)" title="The Stranger (film)">The Stranger</a></i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson" title="Edward G.

While Anthony Veiller was credited with the screenplay, it had been rewritten by Welles and <a href="/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>. Disputes occurred during the editing process between Spiegal and Welles.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1946, Welles directed a musical stage version of <i><a href="/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days_(book)" title="Around the World in Eighty Days (book)">Around the World in Eighty Days</a></i>, with a comedic and ironic rewriting of the <a href="/wiki/Jules_Verne" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> novel by Welles, incidental music and songs by <a href="/wiki/Cole_Porter" title="Cole Porter">Cole Porter</a>, and production by <a href="/wiki/Mike_Todd" title="Mike Todd">Mike Todd</a>, who would later produce the successful film version with <a href="/wiki/David_Niven" title="David Niven">David Niven</a>. When Todd pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, Welles supported the finances himself. When he ran out of money at one point, he convinced Columbia president <a href="/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> to send him enough to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show would soon fail due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes. The complicated finanical arrangements concerning the show, its losses and Welles's arrangement with Cohn resulted in a tax dispute with the IRS.</p>
<p>At the same time in 1946 he began two new radio series, <i>The Mercury Summer Theatre</i> for CBS and <i>Orson Welles Commentaries</i> for ABC. While <i>Summer Theatre</i> featured half-hour adaptations of some of the classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his <i>Around the World</i> stage play, and remains the only record of <a href="/wiki/Cole_Porter" title="Cole Porter">Cole Porter</a>'s music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. It was only scheduled for the summer months, and Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. <i>Commentaries</i> was a political soap-box, continuing the themes from his New York Post column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the <a href="/wiki/NAACP" title="NAACP" class="mw-redirect">NAACP</a> brought to his attention the case of <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Woodard" title="Isaac Woodard">Isaac Woodard</a>. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause. Soon Welles was being hung in effigy in the South and theaters refused to show the <i>The Stranger</i> in several southern states.</p>
<p>The film for Cohn wound up being <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lady_from_Shanghai" title="The Lady from Shanghai">The Lady from Shanghai</a></i>, filmed in 1947 for <a href="/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. Intended to be a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star. Cohn disliked Welles's rough-cut, in particular the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut had been removed. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was particularly appalled by the soundtrack, objecting to the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce. Though the film was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the US for several decades. A similar situation occurred when Welles suggested to <a href="/wiki/Charles_Chaplin" title="Charles Chaplin" class="mw-redirect">Charles Chaplin</a> that he star in a film directed by Welles based on the life of the French <a href="/wiki/Serial_killer" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henri_D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Landru" title="Henri Désiré Landru">Henri Désiré Landru</a>. Chaplin instead adapted the idea for his own film, <i><a href="/wiki/Monsieur_Verdoux" title="Monsieur Verdoux">Monsieur Verdoux</a></i>, with Welles officially credited for the idea.</p>
<p>In 1948 Welles convinced <a href="/wiki/Republic_Pictures" title="Republic Pictures">Republic Pictures</a> to let him direct a low-budget version of <i><a href="/wiki/Macbeth_(1948_film)" title="Macbeth (1948 film)">Macbeth</a></i>, which featured <a href="/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9" title="Papier-mâché">papier-mâché</a> sets, cardboard crowns and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a prerecorded soundtrack. Republic did not care for the Scottish accents on the soundtrack and held up release for almost a year. Welles left for Europe, while his co-producer and life-long supporter <a href="/w/index.php?title=Richard_Wilson_(producer)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Richard Wilson (producer) (page does not exist)">Richard Wilson</a> reworked the soundtrack. Welles ultimately returned and cut twenty minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover the gaps. The film was decried as another disaster. In the late 1970s, a version of <i>Macbeth</i> was released that attempted to follow Welles's original vision.</p>
<p>During this time, Welles sought to adapt the radio and serial series <i>The Shadow</i> to the big screen. He aimed to direct, produce, write and star in the film. The film never went beyond the initial proposal stage due to lack of investor interest. The Mark Millar article detailing Welles's attempt at a Batman film is partially inspired by this.</p>

<p>Welles left Hollywood for Europe in late 1947, enigmatically saying he had chosen "freedom".</p>
<p>In Italy he starred as <a href="/wiki/Cagliostro" title="Cagliostro" class="mw-redirect">Cagliostro</a> in the 1948 film <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Magic_(1949_film)" title="Black Magic (1949 film)">Black Magic</a></i>. His co-star, <a href="/wiki/Akim_Tamiroff" title="Akim Tamiroff">Akim Tamiroff</a>, impressed Welles so much that he appeared in four of Welles's own productions during the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>The following year, Welles appeared as <a href="/wiki/Harry_Lime" title="Harry Lime" class="mw-redirect">Harry Lime</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Third_Man" title="The Third Man">The Third Man</a></i>, written by <a href="/wiki/Graham_Greene" title="Graham Greene">Graham Greene</a>, directed by <a href="/wiki/Carol_Reed" title="Carol Reed">Carol Reed</a>, starring Mercury Theatre alumnus <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>, and with a memorable <a href="/wiki/Zither" title="Zither">zither</a> score by <a href="/wiki/Anton_Karas" title="Anton Karas">Anton Karas</a>. The film was an international smash hit, but Welles unfortunately turned down a percentage of the gross in exchange for a lump-sum advance. A few years later British radio producer <a href="/wiki/Harry_Alan_Towers" title="Harry Alan Towers">Harry Alan Towers</a> would resurrect the Lime character for radio in the series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lives_of_Harry_Lime" title="The Lives of Harry Lime">The Lives of Harry Lime</a></i>. The 1951 series included new recordings by Karas, was very successful, and ran for 52 weeks. Welles claimed to write a handful of episodes – a claim disputed by Towers, who maintains they were written by <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Borneman" title="Ernest Borneman">Ernest Borneman</a> – which would later serve as the basis for the screenplay of Welles's <i><a href="/wiki/Mr._Arkadin" title="Mr. Arkadin">Mr. Arkadin</a></i> (1955).</p>

<p>Welles also appeared as <a href="/wiki/Cesare_Borgia" title="Cesare Borgia">Cesare Borgia</a> in the 1949 Italian film <i><a href="/wiki/Prince_of_Foxes_(film)" title="Prince of Foxes (film)">Prince of Foxes</a></i>, with <a href="/wiki/Tyrone_Power" title="Tyrone Power">Tyrone Power</a> and Mercury Theatre alumnus <a href="/wiki/Everett_Sloane" title="Everett Sloane">Everett Sloane</a>, and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Black_Rose" title="The Black Rose">The Black Rose</a></i> (again with Tyrone Power). During this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play <i><a href="/wiki/Othello" title="Othello">Othello</a></i>.</p>
<p>From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on <i><a href="/wiki/Othello_(1952_film)" title="Othello (1952 film)">Othello</a></i>, filming on location in Europe and <a href="/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. The film featured Welles's old friends <a href="/wiki/Miche%C3%A1l_MacL%C3%ADamm%C3%B3ir" title="Micheál MacLíammóir">Micheál MacLíammóir</a> as <a href="/wiki/Iago" title="Iago">Iago</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hilton_Edwards" title="Hilton Edwards">Hilton Edwards</a> as <a href="/wiki/Desdemona_(Othello)" title="Desdemona (Othello)">Desdemona</a>'s father <a href="/wiki/Brabantio" title="Brabantio">Brabantio</a>. <a href="/wiki/Suzanne_Cloutier" title="Suzanne Cloutier">Suzanne Cloutier</a> starred as Desdemona and <a href="/wiki/Campbell_Playhouse" title="Campbell Playhouse" class="mw-redirect">Campbell Playhouse</a> alumnus <a href="/wiki/Robert_Coote" title="Robert Coote">Robert Coote</a> appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.</p>
<p>Filming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left to find other acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammóir's published memoir <i>Put Money in Thy Purse</i>. When it premiered at the <a href="/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> it won the <a href="/wiki/Palme_d%27Or" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a>, but was not given a general release in the United States until 1955 (by which time Welles had re-cut the first reel and re-dubbed most of the film, removing Cloutier's voice entirely), and it played only in <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> and Los Angeles. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a complete drop-out of sound at every quiet moment, and it was one of these flawed prints that was restored by Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing <a href="/wiki/Angelo_Francesco_Lavagnino" title="Angelo Francesco Lavagnino">Angelo Francesco Lavagnino</a>'s original musical score (which was inaudible) and adding ambient stereo sound effects (which weren't in the original film). Though still active in Italy, Lavagnino was not consulted. The subject of great controversy among film scholars, the restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America. A print of the US version was released on laser-disc in 1995 and soon withdrawn after a legal challenge by Beatrice Welles-Smith. The original Cannes version has survived but is not commercially available.</p>
<p>In 1952 Welles continued finding work in England, after the success of the <i>Harry Lime</i> radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Black_Museum" title="The Black Museum">The Black Museum</a></i>, with Welles as host and narrator, and this would also run 52 weeks. Director Herbert Wilcox offered him the part of the murdered victim in <i><a href="/wiki/Trent%27s_Last_Case" title="Trent's Last Case">Trent's Last Case</a></i>, based on the novel by <a href="/wiki/E._C._Bentley" title="E. C. Bentley" class="mw-redirect">E. C. Bentley</a>. And in 1953 the <a href="/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> hired Welles to read an hour of selections from <a href="/wiki/Walt_Whitman" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>'s epic poem <i><a href="/wiki/Song_of_Myself" title="Song of Myself">Song of Myself</a></i>. Towers hired Welles again, to play <a href="/wiki/Professor_Moriarty" title="Professor Moriarty">Professor Moriarty</a> in the radio series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes" title="The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes">The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</a></i>, starring <a href="/wiki/John_Gielgud" title="John Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Richardson" title="Ralph Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>.</p>
<p>Late in 1953, Welles returned to America to star in a live CBS <i><a href="/wiki/Omnibus_(US_TV_series)" title="Omnibus (US TV series)" class="mw-redirect">Omnibus</a></i> television presentation of Shakespeare's <i><a href="/wiki/King_Lear" title="King Lear">King Lear</a></i>. The cast included MacLiammóir and the British actor <a href="/wiki/Alan_Badel" title="Alan Badel">Alan Badel</a>. While Welles received good notices, he was guarded by IRS agents, prohibited to leave his hotel room when not at the studio, prevented from making any purchases, and the entire sum (less expenses) he earned went to his tax bill. Welles returned to England after the broadcast.</p>
<p>In 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of <i><a href="/wiki/Three_Cases_of_Murder" title="Three Cases of Murder">Three Cases of Murder</a></i>, co-starring Badel. <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Wilcox" title="Herbert Wilcox">Herbert Wilcox</a> cast him as the antagonist in <i>Trouble in Glen</i> opposite <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Lockwood" title="Margaret Lockwood">Margaret Lockwood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Forrest_Tucker" title="Forrest Tucker">Forrest Tucker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Victor_McLaglen" title="Victor McLaglen">Victor McLaglen</a>. Old friend <a href="/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a> cast him as Father Mapple in his film adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Herman_Melville" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Moby-Dick" title="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a></i>, starring <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a>.</p>
<p>Welles's next turn as director was the film <i><a href="/wiki/Mr._Arkadin" title="Mr. Arkadin">Mr. Arkadin</a></i> (1955), produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars <a href="/wiki/Robert_Arden" title="Robert Arden">Robert Arden</a>, who had worked on the Harry Lime series, Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was completely dubbed by actress <a href="/wiki/Billie_Whitelaw" title="Billie Whitelaw">Billie Whitelaw</a>, and guest stars <a href="/wiki/Akim_Tamiroff" title="Akim Tamiroff">Akim Tamiroff</a>, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Redgrave" title="Michael Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a>, <a href="/wiki/Katina_Paxinou" title="Katina Paxinou">Katina Paxinou</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mischa_Auer" title="Mischa Auer">Mischa Auer</a>. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version which Dolivet completed was retitled <i>Confidential Report</i>. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Filmmuseum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements. Released on DVD by the Criterion Company, it is considered by Welles scholar and director <a href="/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> to be the best version of Welles's original intentions for the film.</p>
<p>Also in 1955 Welles directed two television series for the BBC. The first was <i>Orson Welles's Sketchbook</i>, a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of <i>It's All True</i> and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was <i><a href="/wiki/Around_the_World_with_Orson_Welles" title="Around the World with Orson Welles">Around the World with Orson Welles</a></i>, a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as Venice, the <a href="/wiki/Basque_Country_(historical_territory)" title="Basque Country (historical territory)" class="mw-redirect">Basque Country</a> between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore). A seventh episode of this series, based on the Gaston Dominici case, was suppressed at the time by the French government, but was reconstructed after Welles's death and released to video in 1999.</p>
<p>In 1956 Welles completed <i><a href="/wiki/Portrait_of_Gina" title="Portrait of Gina">Portrait of Gina</a></i>, posthumously aired on German television under the title <i>Viva Italia</i>, a 30-minute personal essay on <a href="/wiki/Gina_Lollobrigida" title="Gina Lollobrigida">Gina Lollobrigida</a> and the general subject of Italian sex symbols. Dissatisfied with the results - Welles recalled he had worked on it a lot and the result looked like it - he left the only print behind at the <a href="/wiki/H%C3%B4tel_Ritz_Paris" title="Hôtel Ritz Paris">Ritz Hotel</a> in Paris. The film cans would remain in a lost and found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were rediscovered after Welles's death.</p>

<p>In 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood, guesting on radio shows (notably as narrator of <i>Tomorrow</i>, a nuclear holocaust drama produced by the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Civil_Defense_Administration" title="Federal Civil Defense Administration">Federal Civil Defense Administration</a>). He guest starred on television shows, including <i><a href="/wiki/I_Love_Lucy" title="I Love Lucy">I Love Lucy</a></i> and began filming a projected pilot for <a href="/wiki/Desilu" title="Desilu" class="mw-redirect">Desilu</a>, owned by <a href="/wiki/Lucille_Ball" title="Lucille Ball">Lucille Ball</a> and her husband <a href="/wiki/Desi_Arnaz" title="Desi Arnaz">Desi Arnaz</a>, who had recently purchased the former RKO studios. The film was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Fountain_of_Youth_(film)" title="The Fountain of Youth (film)">The Fountain of Youth</a></i>, based on a story by <a href="/wiki/John_Collier_(writer)" title="John Collier (writer)">John Collier</a>. Originally deemed not viable as a pilot, the film wasn't aired until 1958. It won the <a href="/wiki/Peabody_Award" title="Peabody Award">Peabody Award</a> for excellence. Welles's next feature film role was in <i><a href="/wiki/Man_in_the_Shadow" title="Man in the Shadow">Man in the Shadow</a></i> for <a href="/wiki/Universal_Pictures" title="Universal Pictures" class="mw-redirect">Universal Pictures</a> in 1957, starring <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Chandler_(actor)" title="Jeff Chandler (actor)">Jeff Chandler</a>.</p>
<p>Welles stayed on at Universal to direct (and co-star with) <a href="/wiki/Charlton_Heston" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</a> in the 1958 film <i><a href="/wiki/Touch_of_Evil" title="Touch of Evil">Touch of Evil</a></i>, based on <a href="/wiki/Whit_Masterson" title="Whit Masterson">Whit Masterson</a>'s novel <i><a href="/wiki/Badge_of_Evil" title="Badge of Evil">Badge of Evil</a></i> (Welles, who wrote the screenplay for the film, claimed never to have read the book). Originally only hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by <a href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> at the suggestion (and insistence) of Charlton Heston. Reuniting many actors and technicians with whom he'd worked in Hollywood in the 1940s (including cameraman <a href="/wiki/Russell_Metty" title="Russell Metty">Russell Metty</a> [<i>The Stranger</i>], make-up artist Maurice Siederman (<i>Citizen Kane</i>), and actors <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich" title="Marlene Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a>, and Akim Tamiroff), filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. After the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot. Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections. The studio followed a few of the ideas, but cut another 30 minutes from the film and released it. The film was widely praised across Europe, awarded the top prize at the <a href="/wiki/Expo_%2758" title="Expo '58" class="mw-redirect">Brussels World's Fair</a>.</p>
<p>In 1978, the long preview version of the film was rediscovered and released. In 1998, editor <a href="/wiki/Walter_Murch" title="Walter Murch">Walter Murch</a> and producer <a href="/wiki/Rick_Schmidlin" title="Rick Schmidlin">Rick Schmidlin</a>, consulting the original memo, used a workprint version to attempt to create a version of the film as close as possible to that outlined in the memo. This is at best a compromise that should not be mistaken for Welles's original intent. Welles stated in that memo that the film was no longer his version — it was the studio's, but as such, he was still prepared to help them with it.</p>
<p>As Universal reworked <i>Touch of Evil</i>, Welles began filming his adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a>' novel <i><a href="/wiki/Don_Quixote" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a></i> in Mexico, starring <a href="/wiki/Mischa_Auer" title="Mischa Auer">Mischa Auer</a> as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as <a href="/wiki/Sancho_Panza" title="Sancho Panza">Sancho Panza</a>. While filming would continue in fits and starts for several years, Welles would never complete the project.</p>
<p>Welles continued acting, notably in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Long,_Hot_Summer" title="The Long, Hot Summer">The Long, Hot Summer</a></i> (1958) and <i><a href="/wiki/Compulsion_(film)" title="Compulsion (film)">Compulsion</a></i> (1959), but soon returned to Europe.</p>

<p>He continued shooting <i>Don Quixote</i> in Spain, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.</p>
<p>In Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as <a href="/wiki/King_Saul" title="King Saul" class="mw-redirect">King Saul</a> in Richard Pottier's film <i>David and Goliath</i>. In Hong Kong he co-starred with <a href="/wiki/Curd_J%C3%BCrgens" title="Curd Jürgens">Curd Jürgens</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lewis_Gilbert" title="Lewis Gilbert">Lewis Gilbert</a>'s film <i><a href="/wiki/Ferry_to_Hong_Kong" title="Ferry to Hong Kong">Ferry to Hong Kong</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1960 in Paris he co-starred in <a href="/wiki/Richard_Fleischer" title="Richard Fleischer">Richard Fleischer</a>'s film <i>Crack in the Mirror</i>. In <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> he starred in <a href="/wiki/Richard_Thorpe" title="Richard Thorpe">Richard Thorpe</a>'s film <i>The Tartars</i>. He also staged a play at the <a href="/wiki/Gate_Theatre" title="Gate Theatre">Gate Theatre</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> which compressed five of Shakespeare's history plays in order to focus on the story of <a href="/wiki/Falstaff" title="Falstaff">Falstaff</a>. <a href="/wiki/Keith_Baxter_(actor)" title="Keith Baxter (actor)">Keith Baxter</a> played Prince Hal and Welles called his adaptation <i><a href="/wiki/Chimes_at_Midnight" title="Chimes at Midnight">Chimes at Midnight</a></i>.</p>
<p>By this time ceased filming <i>Quixote</i>. Though he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1970s, he never completed the film. As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director <a href="/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_Franco" title="Jesús Franco">Jesús Franco</a> constructed a film out of the portions of <i>Quixote</i> left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.</p>
<p>In 1961 Welles directed <i>In the Land of Don Quixote</i>, a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network <a href="/wiki/RAI" title="RAI">RAI</a>. Similar to the <i>Around the World with Orson Welles</i> series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.</p>
<p>In 1962 Welles directed his adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Trial_(1962_film)" title="The Trial (1962 film)">The Trial</a></i>, based on the novel by <a href="/wiki/Franz_Kafka" title="Franz Kafka">Franz Kafka</a> and produced by <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Salkind" title="Alexander Salkind">Alexander Salkind</a> and Michael Salkind. The cast included <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Perkins" title="Anthony Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a> as Josef K, <a href="/wiki/Jeanne_Moreau" title="Jeanne Moreau">Jeanne Moreau</a>, <a href="/wiki/Romy_Schneider" title="Romy Schneider">Romy Schneider</a>, Paola Mori and Akim Tamiroff. While filming exteriors in <a href="/wiki/Zagreb" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the <a href="/wiki/Gare_d%27Orsay" title="Gare d'Orsay">Gare d'Orsay</a>, at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a "<a href="/wiki/Jules_Verne" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> modernism" and a melancholy sense of "waiting", both suitable for Kafka. The film failed at the box-office. <a href="/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny. During the filming, Welles met <a href="/wiki/Oja_Kodar" title="Oja Kodar">Oja Kodar</a>, who would later become his muse, star and partner for the last twenty years of his life.</p>
<p>Welles plays a film director in <i><a href="/wiki/La_Ricotta" title="La Ricotta" class="mw-redirect">La Ricotta</a></i> - <a href="/wiki/Pier_Paolo_Pasolini" title="Pier Paolo Pasolini">Pier Paolo Pasolini</a>'s segment of the <i><a href="/wiki/Ro.Go.Pa.G." title="Ro.Go.Pa.G.">Ro.Go.Pa.G.</a></i> movie. He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming <i><a href="/wiki/Chimes_at_Midnight" title="Chimes at Midnight">Chimes at Midnight</a></i>, which was completed in 1966. Filmed in Spain, it was a condensation of five Shakespeare plays, telling the story of <a href="/wiki/Falstaff" title="Falstaff">Falstaff</a> and his relationship with Prince Hal. The cast included <a href="/wiki/Keith_Baxter_(actor)" title="Keith Baxter (actor)">Keith Baxter</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Gielgud" title="John Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jeanne_Moreau" title="Jeanne Moreau">Jeanne Moreau</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fernando_Rey" title="Fernando Rey">Fernando Rey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Rutherford" title="Margaret Rutherford">Margaret Rutherford</a>, with narration by <a href="/wiki/Ralph_Richardson" title="Ralph Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>. Music was again by <a href="/wiki/Angelo_Francesco_Lavagnino" title="Angelo Francesco Lavagnino">Angelo Francesco Lavagnino</a>. Jess Franco served as second unit director.</p>
<p>In 1966, Welles directed a film for French television, an adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Immortal_Story" title="The Immortal Story">The Immortal Story</a></i>, by <a href="/wiki/Karen_Blixen" title="Karen Blixen">Karen Blixen</a>. Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, Roger Coggio and <a href="/wiki/Norman_Eshley" title="Norman Eshley">Norman Eshley</a>. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Isak Dinesen's <i>The Heroine</i>, meant to be a companion piece to <i>The Immortal Story</i> and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_Thomas_Wolsey" title="Cardinal Thomas Wolsey" class="mw-redirect">Cardinal Wolsey</a> in <a href="/wiki/Fred_Zinnemann" title="Fred Zinnemann">Fred Zinnemann</a>'s adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/A_Man_for_All_Seasons_(1966_film)" title="A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)">A Man for All Seasons</a></i> - a role for which he won considerable acclaim.</p>
<p>In 1967 Welles began directing <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Deep_(1970_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Deep (1970 film) (page does not exist)">The Deep</a></i>, based on the novel <i><a href="/wiki/Dead_Calm" title="Dead Calm">Dead Calm</a></i> by Charles F. Williams and filmed off the shore of <a href="/wiki/Yugoslavia" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Harvey" title="Laurence Harvey">Laurence Harvey</a> and Kodar. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum München. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title <i>Orson's Bag</i>, combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's play <i><a href="/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice" title="The Merchant of Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a></i> with Welles as <a href="/wiki/Shylock" title="Shylock">Shylock</a>. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.</p>
<p>In 1969, Welles authorised the use of his name for a cinema in <a href="/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Orson_Welles_Cinema" title="Orson Welles Cinema">Orson Welles Cinema</a> remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969 he played a supporting role in <a href="/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Kremlin_Letter" title="The Kremlin Letter">The Kremlin Letter</a></i>. Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of <i>Don Quixote</i> and moved back to America in 1970.</p>

<p>Welles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his own film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on talk shows, and made frequent appearances for <a href="/wiki/Dick_Cavett" title="Dick Cavett">Dick Cavett</a>, <a href="/wiki/Johnny_Carson" title="Johnny Carson">Johnny Carson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dean_Martin" title="Dean Martin">Dean Martin</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Merv_Griffin" title="Merv Griffin">Merv Griffin</a>. Welles's primary focus in this period was filming <i><a href="/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_the_Wind" title="The Other Side of the Wind">The Other Side of the Wind</a></i>, a project that took six years to film but has remained unfinished and unreleased. An early role was portraying <a href="/wiki/Louis_XVIII_of_France" title="Louis XVIII of France">Louis XVIII of France</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Waterloo_(film)" title="Waterloo (film)">Waterloo</a></i> (1970).</p>
<p>Welles also narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the <a href="/wiki/Bud_Yorkin" title="Bud Yorkin">Bud Yorkin</a> historical comedy <i><a href="/wiki/Start_the_Revolution_Without_Me" title="Start the Revolution Without Me">Start the Revolution Without Me</a></i>, which starred <a href="/wiki/Gene_Wilder" title="Gene Wilder">Gene Wilder</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donald_Sutherland" title="Donald Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Griffith" title="Hugh Griffith">Hugh Griffith</a>, among others.</p>
<p>In 1971 Welles directed a short adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/Moby-Dick" title="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a></i>, a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his stage production <i><a href="/wiki/Moby_Dick_Rehearsed" title="Moby Dick Rehearsed">Moby Dick Rehearsed</a></i> from the 1950s. Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum München. He also appeared in <i>La Décade prodigieuse</i>, co-starring with <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Perkins" title="Anthony Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a> and directed by <a href="/wiki/Claude_Chabrol" title="Claude Chabrol">Claude Chabrol</a>, based on a detective novel by <a href="/wiki/Ellery_Queen" title="Ellery Queen">Ellery Queen</a>. That same year, the <a href="/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences" title="Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> gave him an honorary award "For superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures". Welles pretended to be out of town and sent <a href="/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a> to claim the award. Huston criticized the Academy for awarding Welles while they refused to give him any work.</p>
<p>In 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of <a href="/wiki/Alvin_Toffler" title="Alvin Toffler">Alvin Toffler</a>'s 1970 book <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Shock" title="Future Shock">Future Shock</a></i>.

<p>Working again for a British producer, Welles played <a href="/wiki/Long_John_Silver" title="Long John Silver">Long John Silver</a> in director <a href="/wiki/John_Hough" title="John Hough">John Hough</a>'s 1973 <a href="/wiki/Treasure_Island_(1972_film)" title="Treasure Island (1972 film)">adaptation</a> of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Louis_Stevenson" title="Robert Louis Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s novel <i><a href="/wiki/Treasure_Island" title="Treasure Island">Treasure Island</a></i>, which had been the second story broadcast by <i>The Mercury Theatre on the Air</i> in 1938. Welles also contributed to the script, his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'.</p>
<p>In 1975, Welles narrated the documentary <i><a href="/wiki/Bugs_Bunny:_Superstar" title="Bugs Bunny: Superstar">Bugs Bunny: Superstar</a></i>, focusing on <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the <a href="/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to director <a href="/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a> and actor <a href="/wiki/James_Cagney" title="James Cagney">James Cagney</a>). At the ceremony, Welles screened two scenes from the nearly finished <i><a href="/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_the_Wind" title="The Other Side of the Wind">The Other Side of the Wind</a></i>. Filming had begun in 1972 and by 1976, Welles had almost completed the film. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the <a href="/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi" title="Mohammad Reza Pahlavi">Shah of Iran</a> was deposed. Written by Welles, the story told of a destructive old film director looking for funds to complete his final film. It starred John Huston and the cast included <a href="/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a>, <a href="/wiki/Susan_Strasberg" title="Susan Strasberg">Susan Strasberg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Norman_Foster_(director)" title="Norman Foster (director)">Norman Foster</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edmond_O%27Brien" title="Edmond O'Brien">Edmond O'Brien</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cameron_Mitchell_(actor)" title="Cameron Mitchell (actor)">Cameron Mitchell</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Hopper" title="Dennis Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a>. While there have been several reports of all the legal disputes concerning ownership of the film being settled, enough disputes still exist to prevent its release. The <a href="/wiki/Showtime" title="Showtime">Showtime</a> cable network has promised support for the project should the various entanglements associated with it be resolved.</p>
<p>In 1979 Welles completed his documentary <i><a href="/wiki/Filming_Othello" title="Filming Othello">Filming Othello</a></i>, which featured Michael MacLiammoir and Hilton Edwards. Made for West German television, it was also released in theaters. That same year, Welles completed his self-produced pilot for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Orson_Welles_Show_(TV_pilot)" title="The Orson Welles Show (TV pilot)" class="mw-redirect">The Orson Welles Show</a></i> television series, featuring interviews with <a href="/wiki/Burt_Reynolds" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jim_Henson" title="Jim Henson">Jim Henson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Oz" title="Frank Oz">Frank Oz</a> and guest-starring <a href="/wiki/The_Muppets" title="The Muppets">The Muppets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Angie_Dickinson" title="Angie Dickinson">Angie Dickinson</a>. Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast.</p>
<p>Beginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements, acting as the on-camera spokesman for the <a href="/wiki/Paul_Masson" title="Paul Masson">Paul Masson</a> wine company. The sign-off phrase of the commercials — "We will sell no wine before its time" — became a national catchphrase. He was also the voice behind the long-running <a href="/wiki/Carlsberg" title="Carlsberg" class="mw-redirect">Carlsberg</a> "Probably the best lager in the world" campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The "probably" tag is still in use today. During coverage of these commercials on <a href="/w/index.php?title=Ads_Infinitum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ads Infinitum (page does not exist)">Ads Infinitum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Victor_Lewis-Smith" title="Victor Lewis-Smith">Victor Lewis-Smith</a>, a critic of Masson wines, fondly remarked that Welles endorsements of the wine were proof he was "a genius, but a lying bastard" and promptly showed an outtake of Welles being impossible to work with in a commercial shoot. In 1979 Welles also appeared in the biopic <i>The Secret Life of <a href="/wiki/Nikola_Tesla" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a></i>.</p>
<p>In 1981, Welles hosted the documentary <i><a href="/wiki/The_Man_Who_Saw_Tomorrow" title="The Man Who Saw Tomorrow">The Man Who Saw Tomorrow</a></i>, about <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>-era prophet <a href="/wiki/Nostradamus" title="Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a>. In 1982 the BBC broadcast <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Orson_Welles_Story&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Orson Welles Story (page does not exist)">The Orson Welles Story</a></i> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Arena_(TV_series)" title="Arena (TV series)">Arena</a></i> series. Interviewed by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Leslie_Megahey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Leslie Megahey (page does not exist)">Leslie Megahey</a>, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as <i>With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film</i>.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Dreamers_(unfinished_film_by_Orson_Welles)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Dreamers (unfinished film by Orson Welles) (page does not exist)">The Dreamers</a></i>, based on two stories by <a href="/wiki/Isak_Dinesen" title="Isak Dinesen" class="mw-redirect">Isak Dinesen</a> and starring Oja Kodar, and <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Orson_Welles_Magic_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Orson Welles Magic Show (page does not exist)">The Orson Welles Magic Show</a></i>, which reused material from his failed TV pilot. Another project he worked on was <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Filming_The_Trial&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Filming The Trial (page does not exist)">Filming The Trial</a></i>, the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them were completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München. Also during this time he recorded narration for the tracks <a href="/wiki/Battle_Hymns_(Manowar_album)" title="Battle Hymns (Manowar album)">"Dark Avenger"</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fighting_the_World" title="Fighting the World">"Defender"</a> by <a href="/wiki/Heavy_metal_music" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a> band <a href="/wiki/Manowar" title="Manowar">Manowar</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Welles was the narrator of the short-lived television series <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Scene_of_the_Crime_(1984_TV_series)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Scene of the Crime (1984 TV series) (page does not exist)">Scene of the Crime</a></i>.</p>
<p>During the early years of <i><a href="/wiki/Magnum,_P.I." title="Magnum, P.I.">Magnum, P.I.</a></i>, Welles was the voice of the unseen character <a href="/wiki/Robin_Masters" title="Robin Masters">Robin Masters</a>, a famous writer and <a href="/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">playboy</a>. Welles' death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the <i>Magnum, P.I.</i> producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The last film roles before Welles's death included voice work in the animated films <i>The Enchanted Journey</i> (1984) and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie" title="The Transformers: The Movie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></i> (1986), in which he played the planet-eating <a href="/wiki/Robot" title="Robot">robot</a> <a href="/wiki/Unicron" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>. His last film appearance was in <a href="/wiki/Henry_Jaglom" title="Henry Jaglom">Henry Jaglom</a>'s 1987 independent film <i><a href="/wiki/Someone_to_Love_(film)" title="Someone to Love (film)">Someone to Love</a></i>, released after his death but produced before his voice-over in <i>Transformers: The Movie</i>. His last television appearance was on the <a href="/wiki/Television_show" title="Television show" class="mw-redirect">television show</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Moonlighting_(TV_series)" title="Moonlighting (TV series)">Moonlighting</a></i>. He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice", which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.</p>

<p>Welles went on to have three children with three different women: <a href="/wiki/Children%27s_author" title="Children's author" class="mw-redirect">children's author</a> Christopher Welles (born in 1937 with Virginia Nicholson), <a href="/wiki/Rebecca_Welles" title="Rebecca Welles">Rebecca Welles Manning</a> (born in 1944 with Rita Hayworth) and Beatrice Welles (born circa November 1955 to Paola Mori).</p>
<p>According to a 1941 <a href="/wiki/Physical_exam" title="Physical exam" class="mw-redirect">physical exam</a> taken when he was 26, Welles was 72 inches (182.9 cm) tall and weighed 218 pounds (98.9 kg).

<p>In April 1982, <a href="/wiki/Merv_Griffin" title="Merv Griffin">Merv Griffin</a> interviewed Welles and asked about his religious beliefs. Welles replied, "I try to be a Christian, I don't pray really, because I don't want to bore God."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> After the success of his 1941 film <i>Citizen Kane</i>, Welles announced that his next film would be about the life of <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ" class="mw-redirect">Jesus Christ</a>, and that he would play the lead role. However, Welles never got around to making the film.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> He narrated the <a href="/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a>-<a href="/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentary</a> <i><a href="/wiki/The_Late,_Great_Planet_Earth" title="The Late, Great Planet Earth">The Late, Great Planet Earth</a></i> as well as the 1961 Biblical film about the life of Christ, <i><a href="/wiki/King_of_Kings_(film)" title="King of Kings (film)">King of Kings</a></i>.</p>
<p>Some of Welles' claimed familial ties have not held up under scrutiny. Despite the persistent urban legend, promoted by Welles himself, he was not the great-grandson of Abraham Lincoln's wartime Secretary of the Navy, <a href="/wiki/Gideon_Welles" title="Gideon Welles">Gideon Welles</a>.

<p>Welles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained a man of the <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" title="Left-wing politics">left</a> throughout his life, and always defined his political orientation as "<a href="/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States" title="Progressivism in the United States">progressive</a>."

<p>Welles's reliance on self-production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or were not completed. Welles financed his later projects through his own fundraising activities. He often also took on other work to obtain money to fund his own films.</p>
<p>In the mid-1950s, Welles began work on <i><a href="/wiki/Don_Quixote" title="Don Quixote">Don Quixote</a></i>, initially a commission from <a href="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> television. Welles expanded the film to feature length, developing the screenplay to take Quixote and <a href="/wiki/Sancho_Panza" title="Sancho Panza">Sancho Panza</a> into the modern age. Filming stopped with the death of Francisco Reiguera, the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing. The project and more importantly Welles conception of the project changed radically over time. A version of the film was created from available fragments of the film in 1992 and released to a very negative reception.</p>
<p>In 1970 Welles began shooting <i><a href="/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_the_Wind" title="The Other Side of the Wind">The Other Side of the Wind</a></i>, about the effort of a film director (played by <a href="/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>) to complete his last Hollywood picture, and is largely set at a lavish party. By 1972, the filming was reported by Welles as being "96% complete",<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> but Welles had only edited 40% of the film by 1979. In that year, legel complications over the ownership of the film forced the negative into a Paris vault where it remained until 2004, when <a href="/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> (who also acted in the film) announced his intention to complete the production. As of 2009, legal complications over the Welles estate have kept the film from being finished or released. Some footage is included in the documentary <i>Working with Orson Welles</i> (1993).</p>
<p>Other unfinished projects include <i>The Deep</i>, an adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Williams_(U.S._author)" title="Charles Williams (U.S. author)">Charles Williams</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/Dead_Calm" title="Dead Calm">Dead Calm</a></i> — abandoned in 1970 one scene short of completion due to the death of star <a href="/wiki/Laurence_Harvey" title="Laurence Harvey">Laurence Harvey</a> — and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Big_Brass_Ring" title="The Big Brass Ring">The Big Brass Ring</a></i>, the script of which was adapted and filmed by <a href="/wiki/George_Hickenlooper" title="George Hickenlooper">George Hickenlooper</a> in 1999.</p>
<p>Welles in his later years was unable to obtain funding for his many film projects, but came close with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Big_Brass_Ring" title="The Big Brass Ring">The Big Brass Ring</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/The_Cradle_Will_Rock" title="The Cradle Will Rock">The Cradle Will Rock</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Arnon_Milchan" title="Arnon Milchan">Arnon Milchan</a> had agreed to produce <i>The Big Brass Ring</i> if any one of six actors - <a href="/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clint_Eastwood" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, <a href="/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Burt_Reynolds" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a> - would sign on to star. All six declined for various reasons. Independent funding for <i>The Cradle Will Rock</i> had been obtained and actors had signed on, including <a href="/wiki/Rupert_Everett" title="Rupert Everett">Rupert Everett</a> to play the young Orson Welles, location filming was to be done in New York City with studio work in Italy. While pre-production went without a problem, three weeks before filming was to begin the money fell through. Allegedly Welles approached <a href="/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> to ask for assistance in rescuing the film, but Spielberg declined. The scripts to both films were published posthumously. After a studio auction, he complained that Spielberg spent $50,000 for the Rosebud sled used in <i>Citizen Kane</i>, but would not give him a dime to make a picture. Welles retaliated by publicly announcing the sled to be a fake, the original having been burned in the film, but he later recanted the claim.</p>
<p>The 1995 documentary <i>Orson Welles: One-Man Band</i>, included on the <a href="/wiki/Criterion_Collection" title="Criterion Collection" class="mw-redirect">Criterion Collection</a> DVD release of <i>F for Fake</i>, features scenes from several of these unfinished projects, as well as footage from an adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice" title="The Merchant of Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a></i> starring Welles that was never aired due to vital footage being allegedly stolen; several short subjects such as the titular <i>One-Man Band</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Monty_Python" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a>-esque spoof in which Welles plays all but one of the characters (including two characters in <a href="/wiki/Drag_(clothing)" title="Drag (clothing)">drag</a>); footage of Welles reading chapters from <i><a href="/wiki/Moby-Dick" title="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a></i>; and a comedy skit taking place in a tailor shop and co-starring <a href="/wiki/Charles_Gray_(actor)" title="Charles Gray (actor)">Charles Gray</a>. One short, also included in the documentary, is a comedy routine in which Welles (filmed in the 1970s) plays a reporter interviewing a king, also played by Welles, but in footage shot in the 1960s; Welles finished the skit and edited it together years later. The documentary also includes two completed and edited sequences from the unreleased <i>The Other Side of the Wind</i>, and footage from an unbroadcast <a href="/wiki/Television_pilot" title="Television pilot">television pilot</a> for a talk show (he is shown interviewing <a href="/wiki/The_Muppets" title="The Muppets">The Muppets</a> and discussing his rationale for doing the talk show, which was produced <a href="/wiki/Theatre_in_the_round" title="Theatre in the round">in the round</a>). The documentary is built around a college lecture given by Welles not long before his death, in which he displays frustration at being unable to complete so many projects and having spent so much of his career raising money for films rather than doing creative work.</p>

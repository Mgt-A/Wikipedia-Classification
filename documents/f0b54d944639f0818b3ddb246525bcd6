<p>The <i><b>Roman Legion</b></i> (from <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>legio</i> "military levy, <a href="/wiki/Conscription" title="Conscription">conscription</a>," from <i>legere</i> — "to choose") is a term that can apply both as a translation of <i>legio</i> ("conscription" or "army") to the entire Roman <a href="/wiki/Army" title="Army">army</a> and also, more narrowly (and more commonly), to the <a href="/wiki/Heavy_infantry" title="Heavy infantry">heavy infantry</a> that was the basic military unit of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_army" title="Roman army">ancient Roman army</a> in the period of the late <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. In this latter meaning, it consisted of several <a href="/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)" title="Cohort (military unit)">cohorts</a> of heavy <a href="/wiki/Infantry" title="Infantry">infantry</a> known as <a href="/wiki/Legionaries" title="Legionaries" class="mw-redirect">legionaries</a>. It was almost always accompanied by one or more attached units of <a href="/wiki/Auxiliaries_(Roman_military)" title="Auxiliaries (Roman military)">auxiliaries</a>, who were not Roman citizens and provided <a href="/wiki/Cavalry" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a>, ranged troops and <a href="/wiki/Skirmishers" title="Skirmishers" class="mw-redirect">skirmishers</a> to complement the legion's heavy infantry.</p>
<p>The size of a typical legion varied widely throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements of 4,200 legionaries and 300 equites in the republican period of Rome, (the infantry were split into 30 <a href="/wiki/Maniple_(military_unit)" title="Maniple (military unit)">maniples</a> of 120 legionaries each), to 5,200 men plus auxiliaries in the imperial period (split into 10 <a href="/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)" title="Cohort (military unit)">cohorts</a>, 9 of 480 men each, plus the first cohort holding 800 men).</p>
<p>As legions were not standing armies until the <a href="/wiki/Marian_reforms" title="Marian reforms">Marian reforms</a> (c. 107 BC), and were instead created, used, and disbanded again, several hundred legions were named and numbered throughout Roman history. To date, about 50 have been identified. In the time of the Early Roman Empire, there were usually about 25-35 standing legions plus their Auxiliaries, with more raised as needed. See <a href="/wiki/List_of_Roman_legions" title="List of Roman legions">List of Roman legions</a> for a catalogue of known late republic, early Empire and late Empire legions, with dates in existence, emblem and locations of deployment.</p>
<p>Because of the enormous military successes of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> the legion has long been regarded as the prime ancient model for military efficiency and ability.</p>

<p>In the early years of the Roman Kingdom and the Roman Republic, they did not use legions and instead used centuries of one hundred men which were banded together in random formats and only served the one who had hired them. In the Roman Empire the legions became, although the largest, only one part of the army (predominantly heavy infantry). But in the Roman Kingdom and Roman Republic up until the 2nd century BC, the centuries could be made of light troops and cavalry whose roles would later be taken on by allied troops. Until the 4th century BC the massive Greek <a href="/wiki/Phalanx_formation" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx</a> was the mode of battle. Roman soldiers would have thus looked much like Greek <i><a href="/wiki/Hoplite" title="Hoplite">hoplites</a></i>.</p>
<p>Much of Roman history of this era is founded on legends, but it is believed that during the reign of <a href="/wiki/Servius_Tullius" title="Servius Tullius">Servius Tullius</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Census" title="Census">census</a> (the counting of the people) was introduced. With this, all Roman able-bodied, property-owning male citizens were divided into five classes for military service based on wealth, soldiers having to acquire their own weapons and equipment. These classes were further organized into units of 100 called <a href="/wiki/Centuria" title="Centuria"><i>centuries</i></a> (who also had a centurion, a second in command and a standard bearer).</p>
<p>Joining the army was both a duty and a distinguishing mark of Roman citizenship: during the entire pre-Marian period the wealthiest land owners performed the most years of military service, since these would have had the most to lose should the state have fallen.</p>
<p>The first class was armed in the fashion of the hoplite with spear, sword, helmet, breast plate and <a href="/wiki/Round_shield" title="Round shield" class="mw-redirect">round shield</a> (called <i><a href="/wiki/Clipeus" title="Clipeus">clipeus</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/Latin" title="Latin">Latin</a>, similar to the Greek <i><a href="/wiki/Aspis" title="Aspis">aspis</a></i>, also called <i><a href="/wiki/Hoplon" title="Hoplon" class="mw-redirect">hoplon</a></i>); there were 82 centuries of these of which 2 were trumpeteer. The second and third class also acted as spearmen, but with reduced armour, and the larger oval or rectangular shield. The fourth class could afford no armour, perhaps a small shield, and was armed with spear and javelin. All three of the latter classes made up about 26 centuries. The fifth and final class was composed only of <a href="/wiki/Slingers" title="Slingers">slingers</a>. There were 32 of these of which 2 were engineers. The army officers as well as the cavalry were drawn from leading citizens who enrolled as equestrians (<i>equites</i>). (The equites were later put in smaller groups of 30 and were commanded by decurions (which strangely means commander of ten)), there were 18 centuries of equites.</p>
<p>Tactics were no different from those of the early Greeks and battles were joined on a plain. Spearmen would then deploy themselves in tightly packed rows. The members of each row closed to form a <a href="/wiki/Shield_wall" title="Shield wall">shield wall</a>, their spears pointed forwards, and charged the enemy supported by their javelin throwers and slingers: the cavalry pursued the enemy, and sometimes dismounted to support the infantry in dire situations. It was a cumbersome military unit to manoeuvre, and easily defeated by mountain tribes such as Volsci or Samnites in rough terrains.</p>
<p>Early civilian authorities, called <i>praetors</i>, doubled as military leaders during the war season; lasting from spring to autumn. A formal war declaration included a religious ceremony that ended in the throwing of a ceremonial javelin into the enemy's territory to mark the start of hostilities.</p>

<p>At some point, possibly in the beginning of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic#Overthrow_of_the_kings" title="Roman Republic">kings were overthrown</a>, the <i>legio</i> was subdivided into two separate legions, each one ascribed to one of the two <a href="/wiki/Consul" title="Consul">consuls</a>. In the first years of the Republic, when warfare was mostly concentrated on raiding, it is uncertain if the full manpower of the legions was summoned at any one time. Legions became more formally organized in the 4th century BC, as Roman warfare evolved to more frequent and planned operations, and the consular army was raised to two legions.</p>
<p>In the Republic, legions had an ephemeral existence. Except for Legio I to IV, which were the consular armies (two per consul), other units were levied by campaign. Rome's Italian allies were required to provide a legion to support each Roman Legion.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Republic, legions were composed of the following units:</p>

<li><i><a href="/wiki/Equites" title="Equites" class="mw-redirect">Equites</a></i> (cavalry): The <a href="/wiki/Cavalry" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a> was originally the most prestigious unit, where wealthy young Roman men displayed their skill and prowess, laying the foundation for an eventual political career. Cavalry equipment was purchased by each of the cavalrymen and consisted of a round shield, helmet, body armour, sword and one or more <a href="/wiki/Lance" title="Lance">lances</a>. The cavalry was outnumbered in the legion. In a total of <i>circa</i> 3000 men, (plus the velites that normally enlarged the number to about 4200), the legion had only around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 units of 30 men. These men were commanded by <a href="/wiki/Decurion_(military)" title="Decurion (military)">decurions</a>. In addition to heavy cavalry, there would be the light cavalry levied from poor citizens and wealthy young citizens not old enough to be in the <i>hastati</i> or the <i>equites</i>. In battle, they were used to disrupt and <a href="/wiki/Flanking_maneuver" title="Flanking maneuver">outflank</a> enemy infantry formations and to fight off enemy cavalry. In the latter type of engagement they would often (though not always) dismount some or all of the horsemen to fight a stationary battle on foot, an unusual tactic for the time, but one that offered significant advantages in stability and agility in a time before <a href="/wiki/Stirrup" title="Stirrup">stirrups</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></li>

<li><i><a href="/wiki/Velites" title="Velites">Velites</a></i> (<a href="/wiki/Light_infantry" title="Light infantry">light infantry</a>): The <i>velites</i> were mainly poorer citizens who couldn't afford to equip themselves properly. Their primary function was to act as <a href="/wiki/Skirmishers" title="Skirmishers" class="mw-redirect">skirmishers</a> - javelin-throwers who would engage the enemy early in order either to harass them or to cover the movement of troops behind them. After throwing their javelins they would retreat through the gaps between the maniples, screened from the attack of the enemy by the heavy infantry lines. With the shortage of cavalry in the army of the early to mid Republican army, the <a href="/wiki/Velites" title="Velites">velites</a> were also used as scouts. They did not have a precise formal organization or formation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Heavy_infantry" title="Heavy infantry">Heavy infantry</a>: This was the principal unit of the legion. The heavy infantry was composed of citizen legionaries that could afford the equipment composed of an iron helmet, shield, armour and <a href="/wiki/Pilum" title="Pilum">pilum</a>, a heavy javelin whose range was about 30 meters. After 387 the preferred weapon for the hastati and principes was the <a href="/wiki/Gladius" title="Gladius">gladius</a>, a short sword. Their hobnailed sandals (<i><a href="/wiki/Caligae" title="Caligae">caligae</a></i>) were also an effective weapon against a fallen enemy. Prior to the Marian reforms (see below) the heavy infantry was subdivided, according to experience, into three separate lines of troops:
<ul>
<li>The <i><a href="/wiki/Hastati" title="Hastati">hastati</a></i> (sing. <i>hastatus</i>) consisted of raw or inexperienced soldiers, considered to be less reliable than legionaries of several years' service.</li>
<li>The <i><a href="/wiki/Principes" title="Principes">principes</a></i> (sing. <i>princeps</i>) were men in their prime (late twenties to early thirties).</li>
<li>The <i><a href="/wiki/Triarii" title="Triarii">triarii</a></i> (sing. <i>triarius</i>) were the veteran soldiers, to be used in battle only in extreme situations; they rested one knee down when not engaged in combat. The <i>triarii</i> served primarily as reserves or <a href="/wiki/Barrier_troops" title="Barrier troops">barrier troops</a> designed to backstop the <i>hastati</i> and <i>principes</i>, and were equipped with long <i><a href="/wiki/Hasta_(spear)" title="Hasta (spear)">hastae</a></i> (spears) rather than the <i>pilum</i> and <i>gladius</i> (the <i>hastati</i> and <i>principes</i> stopped using spears in 387 B.C.). Thus armed, they fought in a <a href="/wiki/Phalanx_formation" title="Phalanx formation">phalanx formation</a>. The sight of an advancing armored formation of <i>triarii</i> legionaries frequently discouraged exultant enemies in pursuit of retreating <i>hastati</i> and <i>principes</i> troops. <i>To fall upon the triarii</i> was a Roman <a href="/wiki/Idiom" title="Idiom">idiom</a> - meaning to use one's last resort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these three lines was subdivided into <a href="/wiki/Maniple_(military_unit)" title="Maniple (military unit)">maniples</a>, each consisting of two <a href="/wiki/Centuria" title="Centuria">centuries</a> of 60 men commanded by the senior of the two <a href="/wiki/Centurion" title="Centurion">centurions</a>. Centuries were normally 60 soldiers each at this time in the hastati and principes (no longer 100 men), with 120 strong maniples. There were generally 10 maniples of hastati, 10 maniples of principes and 10 of triarii which had two half strength centuries of 30 men, plus about 1200 velites and 300 cavalry which made up 10 units - 30 men strong. This gave the mid Republican legion a nominal strength of about 4500 men. Later on when the legions undertook the Marian reforms and was made up of 80 strong centuries each century had its standard and was made up of ten units called <i>contubernia</i>. In a contubernium, there would be eight soldiers who shared a tent, millstone, a mule and <a href="/wiki/Cooking_pot" title="Cooking pot" class="mw-redirect">cooking pot</a> (depending on duration of tour). Because maniples were their main tactical elements, the legions of the early Republic are sometimes referred to as <i>Manipular</i> legions.</p>

<p>Following the Marian reforms of the 2nd century BC, the legions took on the second, narrower meaning that is familiar in the popular imagination as close-order citizen heavy infantry.</p>
<p>At the end of the 2nd century BC <a href="/wiki/Gaius_Marius" title="Gaius Marius">Gaius Marius</a> reformed the previously ephemeral legions as a professional force drawing from the poorest classes, enabling Rome to field larger armies and providing employment for jobless citizens of the city of Rome. However, this put the loyalty of the soldiers in the hands of their general rather than Rome itself. In this period all Italian regions obtained full Roman citizenship and provided a larger basis for the army, supplemented by poor urban Romans.</p>
<p>The legions of the Late Republic and Early Empire are often called <i>Marian</i> legions. Following the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Vercellae" title="Battle of Vercellae">Battle of Vercellae</a> in 101 BC, Marius granted all Italian soldiers Roman citizenship. He justified this action to the Senate by saying that in the din of battle he could not distinguish Roman from ally. This effectively eliminated the notion of allied legions; henceforth all Italian legions would be regarded as Roman legions, and full Roman citizenship was open to all the regions of Italy. Thus the three different types of heavy infantry were replaced by a single, standard type based on the <i>Principes</i>: armed with two heavy javelins called <i>pila</i> (singular <i><a href="/wiki/Pilum" title="Pilum">pilum</a></i>), the short sword called <i>gladius</i>, chain mail (<i><a href="/wiki/Lorica_hamata" title="Lorica hamata">lorica hamata</a></i>) or banded armour (<i><a href="/wiki/Lorica_segmentata" title="Lorica segmentata">lorica segmentata</a></i>), helmet and rectangular shield (<i><a href="/wiki/Scutum_(shield)" title="Scutum (shield)">scutum</a></i>).</p>
<p>The role of allied legions would eventually be taken up by contingents of allied auxiliary troops, called <i>Auxilia</i>. Each legion had an <i>auxilia</i> of similar size, which contained specialist units, engineers and pioneers, artillerymen and craftsmen, service and support personnel and irregular units made up of non-citizens, mercenaries and local militia. These were usually formed into complete units such as light cavalry, <a href="/wiki/Light_infantry" title="Light infantry">light infantry</a> or <i><a href="/wiki/Velites" title="Velites">velites</a></i>, and labourers. There was also a <a href="/wiki/Reconnaissance" title="Reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> <a href="/wiki/Squad" title="Squad">squad</a> of 10 or more light <a href="/wiki/Mounted_infantry" title="Mounted infantry">mounted infantry</a> called <i><a href="/wiki/Speculatores" title="Speculatores">speculatores</a></i> who could also serve as messengers or even as an early form of <a href="/wiki/Military_intelligence" title="Military intelligence">military intelligence</a> service.</p>
<p>As part of the Marian reforms, the legions' internal organization was standardized. Each legion was divided into <i><a href="/wiki/Cohort_(military_unit)" title="Cohort (military unit)">cohorts</a></i>. Prior to this, cohorts had been temporary administrative units or tactical task forces of several maniples, even more transitory than the legions themselves. Now the cohorts were ten permanent units, composed of 6 and in the case of the first cohort 8 centuries each led by a centurion assisted by an <i><a href="/wiki/Optio" title="Optio">optio</a></i>, a soldier who could read and write. These came to form the basic tactical unit of the legions. The senior centurion of the legion was called the <i><a href="/wiki/Primus_pilus" title="Primus pilus" class="mw-redirect">primus pilus</a></i>, a career soldier and advisor to the legate that sometimes was promoted to the higher rank.</p>
<p>Every legion had a baggage train of 640 mules or about 1 mule for every 8 legionaries. To keep these baggage trains from becoming too large and slow, Marius had each infantryman carry as much of his own equipment as he could, including his own armour, weapons and 15 days' rations, for about 25-30 kg (50–60 pounds) of load total. To make this easier, he issued each legionary a forked stick to carry their loads on their shoulders. The soldiers were nicknamed <i>Marius' Mules</i> because of the amount of gear they had to carry themselves. This arrangement allowed for the supply train to become detached from the main body of the legion, thus greatly increasing the army's speed while on the march.</p>
<p>A typical legion of this period had 5,120 legionaries as well as a large number of camp followers, servants and slaves. Legions could contain as many as 6,000 fighting men when including the auxiliaries, although much later in Roman history the number was reduced to 1,040 to allow for greater mobility. Numbers would also vary depending on casualties suffered during a campaign; <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>'s legions during his campaign in Gaul often only had around 3,500 men.</p>
<p>Tactics were slightly different from the past, but largely improved because of the professional training of the soldiers.</p>

<p>After the Marian reforms, and throughout the history of Rome's Late Republic, the legions played an important political role. By the 1st century BC the threat of the legions under a <a href="/wiki/Demagogue" title="Demagogue" class="mw-redirect">demagogue</a> was recognized. <a href="/wiki/Roman_Governor" title="Roman Governor" class="mw-redirect">Governors</a> were not allowed to leave their provinces with their legions. When <a href="/wiki/Julius_Caesar" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> broke this rule, leaving his province of Gaul and crossing the <a href="/wiki/Rubicon" title="Rubicon">Rubicon</a> into Italy, he precipitated a <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_crisis" title="Constitutional crisis">constitutional crisis</a>. This crisis and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republican_civil_wars" title="Roman Republican civil wars" class="mw-redirect">civil wars</a> which followed brought an end to the Republic and led to the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Empire</a> under <a href="/wiki/Augustus" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> in 27 BC.</p>

<p>See <i><a href="/wiki/List_of_Roman_legions#Early_Empire_legions" title="List of Roman legions">Directory of Roman legions of the early Empire</a></i></p>
<p>For political and economic reasons, Augustus reduced the number of legions from nearly 50 at the end of his war against <a href="/wiki/Mark_Antony" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a> to only 28 which decomposed to 25 after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Teutoburg_Forest" title="Battle of Teutoburg Forest" class="mw-redirect">Battle of Teutoburg Forest</a> in which 3 legions were slaughtered. Generals during the recent Republican civil wars had formed their own legions and numbered them as they wished. When these wars ended, Augustus was left with around fifty legions, with several double counts (multiple Legio Xs for instance). Beside streamlining the army Augustus also regulated the soldiers' pay. During this time, there was a high incidence of <i>Gemina</i> (twin) legions, where two legions were consolidated into a single organization (and was later made official and put under a dux and six duces).</p>
<p>At the same time, he greatly increased the number of auxiliaries to the point where they were equal in number to the legionaries. He also created the <a href="/wiki/Praetorian_Guard" title="Praetorian Guard">Praetorian Guard</a> along with a permanent <a href="/wiki/Roman_Navy" title="Roman Navy">navy</a> where served the <i>liberti</i>, or freed slaves.</p>
<p>Augustus' military policies proved sound and cost effective, and were generally followed by his successors. These emperors would carefully add new legions, as circumstances required or permitted, until the strength of the standing army stood at around 30 legions. With each legion having 5,120 legionaries usually supported by an equal number of auxiliary troops, the total force available to a legion commander during the <a href="/wiki/Pax_Romana" title="Pax Romana">Pax Romana</a> probably ranged from 153,600 downwards, with the more prestigious legions and those stationed on hostile borders or in restive provinces tending to have more auxiliaries. Some legions may have even been reinforced at times with units making the associated force near 15,000–16,000 or about the size of a modern <a href="/wiki/Division_(military)" title="Division (military)">division</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">imperial</a> era, the legions played an important political role. Their actions could secure the empire for a <a href="/wiki/Roman_usurper" title="Roman usurper">usurper</a> or take it away. For example, the defeat of <a href="/wiki/Vitellius" title="Vitellius">Vitellius</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors" title="Year of the Four Emperors">Year of the Four Emperors</a> was decided when the <a href="/wiki/Danube" title="Danube">Danubian</a> legions chose to support <a href="/wiki/Vespasian" title="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>.</p>
<p>In the empire, the legion was standardized, with symbols and an individual history where men were proud to serve. The legion was commanded by a <i><a href="/wiki/Legatus" title="Legatus">legatus</a></i> or <i>legate</i>. Aged around thirty, he would usually be a senator on a three year appointment. Immediately subordinate to the legate would be six elected <i>military tribunes</i> — five would be staff officers and the remaining one would be a noble heading for the Senate (originally this tribune commanded the legion). There would also be a group of officers for the medical staff, the engineers, record-keepers, the <i>praefectus castrorum</i> (commander of the camp) and other specialists such as priests and musicians.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/Late_Antiquity" title="Late Antiquity">Later Roman Empire</a>, the number of legions was increased and the <a href="/wiki/Military_establishment_of_the_Roman_empire" title="Military establishment of the Roman empire" class="mw-redirect">Roman Army</a> expanded. There is no evidence to suggest that legions changed in form before the <a href="/wiki/Tetrarchy" title="Tetrarchy">Tetrarchy</a>, although there is evidence that they were smaller than the paper strengths usually quoted. The final form of the legion originated with the elite <i>legiones palatinae</i> created by <a href="/wiki/Diocletian" title="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> and the Tetrarchs. These were infantry units of around 1,000 men rather than the 5,000, including cavalry, of the old Legions. The earliest <i>legiones palatinae</i> were the <i>Lanciarii</i>, <i>Joviani</i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Herculians" title="Herculians" class="mw-redirect">Herculiani</a></i> and <i>Divitenses</i>.</p>
<p>The 4th century saw a very large number of new, small legions created, a process which began under <a href="/wiki/Constantine_II_(emperor)" title="Constantine II (emperor)">Constantine II</a>. In addition to the elite <i>palatinae</i>, other legions called <i><a href="/wiki/Comitatenses" title="Comitatenses">comitatenses</a></i> and <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Pseudocomitatenses&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pseudocomitatenses (page does not exist)">pseudocomitatenses</a></i>, along with the <i><a href="/wiki/Auxilia_palatina" title="Auxilia palatina">auxilia palatina</a></i>, provided the infantry of late Roman armies. The <a href="/wiki/Notitia_Dignitatum" title="Notitia Dignitatum">Notitia Dignitatum</a> lists 25 <i>legiones palatinae</i>, 70 <i>legiones comitatenses</i>, 47 <i>legiones pseudocomitatenses</i> and 111 <i>auxilia palatina</i> in the field armies, and a further 47 <i>legiones</i> in the frontier armies.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Legion names such as <i><a href="/wiki/Honorius_(emperor)" title="Honorius (emperor)">Honoriani</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Gratian" title="Gratian">Gratianenses</a></i> found in the Notitia suggest that the process of creating new legions continued through the 4th century rather than being a single event. The names also suggest that many new legions were formed from <i><a href="/wiki/Vexillatio" title="Vexillatio">vexillationes</a></i> or from old legions.</p>
<p>According to the late Roman writer <a href="/wiki/Vegetius" title="Vegetius" class="mw-redirect">Vegetius</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/De_Re_Militari" title="De Re Militari">De Re Militari</a></i>, each century had a <a href="/wiki/Ballista" title="Ballista">ballista</a> and each cohort had an <a href="/wiki/Onager_(siege_weapon)" title="Onager (siege weapon)">onager</a>, giving the legion a formidable siege train of 59 Ballistae and 10 Onagers each manned by 10 <i>libritors</i> (artillerymen) and mounted on wagons drawn by oxen or mules. In addition to attacking cities and fortifications, these would be used to help defend Roman forts and fortified camps (<a href="/wiki/Castra" title="Castra">castra</a>) as well.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Roman_legion&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Centurions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Centurions</span></h3>
<p>The most senior centurions were those of the five centuries of the first cohort. In the remaining cohorts, the six centurions were senior in order of their six centuries, the front centuries in the line of battle being most senior. Within the second to tenth cohorts, the seniority depended on the century, but if two centurions commanded the same century in their cohort, seniority was held by the centurion in the more senior cohort.</p>
<p>The six centuries of a normal cohort, were, in order of precedence:</p>
<ul>
<li>The forward hastati (forward spears)</li>
<li>The rear hastati (rear spears)</li>
<li>The forward principes (forward principal line)</li>
<li>The rear principes (rear principal line)</li>
<li>The forward triarii (forward third line)</li>
<li>The rear triarii (rear third line)</li>
</ul>
<p>The centuries took their titles from the old use of the legion drawn up in three lines of battle using three classes of soldier. (Each century would then hole a cross-section of this theoretical line, although these century titles were now essentially nominal.) Each of the three lines is then sub-divided within the century into a more forward and a more rear century.</p>
<ul>
<li><i><b><a href="/wiki/Primus_pilus" title="Primus pilus" class="mw-redirect">Primus pilus</a></b></i>, literally <b>First File</b>: The <i>Primus Pilus</i> was the commanding centurion of the first cohort and the senior centurion of the entire legion. He was called first file because he commanded the first file century of the first cohort. (Unlike other cohorts, the first cohort had only one javelin century, instead of a "front spear" and a "back spear" century). The Primus Pilus had a chance of later becoming a <i>Praefectus Castrorum</i>. When the primus pilus retired he would most likely gain entry into the equestrian class. He was paid 60 times the base wage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Primi ordines</i>: The "ranks of the first [cohort]" were the five centurions of the first cohort, and included the primus pilus. They, excluding the primus pilus, were paid 30 times the base wage. This rank is senior to all other centurions, save the primus pilus and pilus prior.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Pilus prior</i>: The "front spear" centurions were the senior centurions of the cohorts. While the legion was in battle formation, the Pilus Prior was given command of the entire cohort. The Primus Pilus was also a Pilus Prior, and the most senior of all the centurions within the legion. These positions were usually held by experienced veteran soldiers who had been moved up within the ranks. This rank is subordinate to the Primus Pilus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Other <a href="/wiki/Centurion" title="Centurion">Centurions</a></i>: Each legion had 59 or 60 centurions, one to command each century of the 10 cohorts. They were the backbone of the professional army and were the career soldiers who ran the day to day life of the soldiers and issued commands in the field. They were generally moved up from the ranks, but in some cases could be direct appointments from the Emperor or other higher ranking officials. The cohorts were ranked from the first to the tenth and the century within each cohort ranked from 1 to 6, with only 5 centuries in the first cohort (for a total of 59 centurions and the primus pilus). The century that each centurion commanded was a direct reflection of his rank: command of the first century of the first cohort was the highest, and the 6th century of the 10th cohort was the lowest. An ordinary centurion was the approximate equivalent of a <a href="/wiki/Captain_(land)" title="Captain (land)">Captain</a> in a modern army. Paid ten times the basic wage.</li>

<li><i><a href="/wiki/Signifer" title="Signifer">Signifer</a></i>: Each century had a signifer (59).

<p>From the time of <a href="/wiki/Gaius_Marius" title="Gaius Marius">Gaius Marius</a> onwards, legionaries received 225 <i><a href="/wiki/Denarius" title="Denarius">denarii</a></i> a year; this basic rate remained unchanged until <a href="/wiki/Domitian" title="Domitian">Domitian</a>, who increased it to 300 denarii. In spite of the steady inflation during the 2nd century, there was no further rise until the time of <a href="/wiki/Septimius_Severus" title="Septimius Severus">Septimius Severus</a>, who increased it to 500 denarii a year. However, the soldiers did not receive all the money in cash. From their pay was deducted the money spent by the state for clothing and feeding each soldier, therefore the net salary was not very high.</p>
<p>All legionary soldiers would also receive a sizeable sum of money on the completion of their term of service: 3000 denarii from the time of <a href="/wiki/Augustus" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> and/or a plot of good farmland (good land was in much demand). Later, under <a href="/wiki/Caracalla" title="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>, the <i>praemia</i> increased to 5000 denarii.</p>

<p>From 104 BC onwards, each legion used an <a href="/wiki/Aquila_(Roman)" title="Aquila (Roman)">aquila</a> (eagle) as its standard symbol. The symbol was carried by an officer known as <a href="/wiki/Aquilifer" title="Aquilifer">aquilifer</a>, and its loss was considered to be a very serious embarrassment, and often led to the disbanding of the legion itself. Normally this was due to the fact that any legion incapable of regaining its eagle in battle was so severely mauled it was no longer a workable fighting force.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>In <i>Gallic War</i> (Bk IV, Para. 25), Julius Caesar describes an incident at the start of his first invasion of Britain in 55BC that illustrated how fear for the safety of the eagle could drive Roman soldiers. When Caesar's troops hesitated to leave their ships for fear of the Britons, the aquilifer of the <a href="/wiki/Legio_X_Gemina" title="Legio X Gemina">tenth legion</a> threw himself overboard and, carrying the eagle, advanced alone against the enemy. His comrades, fearing disgrace, 'with one accord, leapt down from the ship' and were followed by troops from the other ships.</p>
<p>With the birth of the Roman Empire, the legions created a bond with their leader, the emperor himself. Each legion had another officer, called <a href="/wiki/Imaginifer" title="Imaginifer">imaginifer</a>, whose role was to carry a pike with the <i>imago</i> (image, sculpture) of the emperor as <i><a href="/wiki/Pontifex_maximus" title="Pontifex maximus" class="mw-redirect">pontifex maximus</a></i>.</p>
<p>Each legion, furthermore, had a <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Vexillifer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Vexillifer (page does not exist)">vexillifer</a></i> who carried a <i>vexillum</i> or <i>signum</i>, with the legion name and emblem depicted on it, unique to the legion. It was common for a legion to detach some sub-units from the main camp to strengthen other corps. In these cases, the detached subunits carried only the vexillum, and not the aquila, and were called, therefore, <i><a href="/wiki/Vexillatio" title="Vexillatio">vexillationes</a></i>. A miniature vexillum, mounted on a silver base, was sometimes awarded to officers as a recognition of their service upon retirement or reassignment.</p>
<p>Civilians could also be rewarded for their assistance to the Roman Legions. In return for outstanding service, a citizen was given an <a href="/wiki/Arrow_without_a_head" title="Arrow without a head">arrow without a head</a>.</p>

<p>The military discipline of the legions was quite harsh. Regulations were strictly enforced, and a broad array of punishments could be inflicted upon a legionary who broke them. Many legionaries became devotees in the cult of the minor goddess <a href="/wiki/Disciplina" title="Disciplina">Disciplina</a>, whose virtues of frugality, severity and loyalty were central to their code of conduct and way of life.</p>

<li>As <a href="/wiki/Montesquieu" title="Montesquieu" class="mw-redirect">Montesquieu</a> wrote, "[I]t should be noted that the main reason for the Romans becoming masters of the world was that, having fought successively against all peoples, they always gave up their own practices as soon as they found better ones."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of ideas that were copied and adapted include weapons like the <a href="/wiki/Gladius" title="Gladius">gladius</a> (Spanish Iberians) and warship design (Carthaginians), as well as military units such as heavy mounted cavalry and mounted archers (Persians).</p>
<ul>
<li>Roman organization was more flexible than those of many opponents. Over time, the legions effectively handled challenges ranging from cavalry, to guerrillas, to siege warfare.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Roman discipline, organization and systematization sustained combat effectiveness over a longer period. These elements appear throughout the legion in training, logistics, field fortification etc.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Romans were more persistent and more willing to absorb and replace losses over time than their opponents. Wars with Carthage, the Parthians and barbarian forces illustrate this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Roman leadership was mixed, but over time it was often effective in securing Roman military success.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The influence of Roman military and civic culture, as embodied particularly in the heavy infantry legion, gave the Roman military consistent motivation and cohesion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Strict, and more importantly, uniform discipline made commanding, maintaining, and replacing Roman legionaries a much more consistent exercise. Roman opponents tended to be tribal peoples without <a href="/wiki/Military_science" title="Military science">military science</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Roman military equipment, particularly armour, was far more ubiquitous and heavy, especially in the late Republican / Early Imperial era, than that of most of their opponents. Soldiers equipped with shields, helmets and highly effective body armor had a major advantage over warriors protected, in many cases, with nothing other than their shields, particularly in a prolonged engagement.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Roman engineering skills were second to none in the ancient world, and their mastery of both offensive and defensive siege warfare, specifically the construction and investiture of fortifications, was another major advantage for the Roman Legions.</li>

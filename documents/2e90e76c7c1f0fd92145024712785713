<p>The Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists (also known as "The Branch") are a <a href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant" class="mw-redirect">Protestant</a> <a href="/wiki/Sect" title="Sect">sect</a> that originated in 1955 from a <a href="/wiki/Schism_(religion)" title="Schism (religion)">schism</a> in the Davidian Seventh Day Adventists ("Davidians"), a <a href="/wiki/Reform_movement" title="Reform movement">reform movement</a> that began within the Seventh-day Adventist Church ("SDA") around 1930. As the group gained members, the leadership moved the church to a hilltop several miles west of Waco, which they named <a href="/wiki/Mount_Carmel" title="Mount Carmel">Mount Carmel</a>, after a mountain on <a href="/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a> mentioned in <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Joshua#Chapter_19" class="extiw" title="wikisource:Bible (King James)/Joshua">Joshua 19:26</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>. A few years later, they moved again to a much larger site east of the city.</p>
<p>In 1959 Florence Houteff (widow of founding Prophet Victor Houteff) announced that the <a href="/wiki/Second_Coming" title="Second Coming">Second Coming</a> of <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus Christ</a> was about to take place, and members were told to gather at the center to await this event. Many built houses, others stayed in tents, trucks or buses, and most sold their possessions.<sup id="cite_ref-perrynetworker_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-perrynetworker-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Following the failure of this prophecy, control of Mt. Carmel fell to Benjamin Roden, and on his death to his wife, Lois. Lois Roden considered their son, George, unfit to assume the position of prophet and groomed Vernon Howell, later known as David Koresh, as her chosen successor. On the death of Lois, George Roden ran Vernon Howell and his faction off Mt. Carmel at gun point. After George Roden was jailed for murder, the Howell faction paid the back taxes on Mt. Carmel and took control.</p>
<p>By 1992, most of the land belonging to the group had been sold, and most of the buildings had been removed, or were being salvaged for construction materials to convert much of the main chapel and a tall water tank into apartments for the resident members of the group. Many of the members of the group had been involved with the Davidians for a few generations, and many had large families.<sup id="cite_ref-people10_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-people10-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The new Mount Carmel Center consisted of a main church building (constructed primarily of thin <a href="/wiki/Plywood" title="Plywood">plywood</a>, taking advantage of a lack of <a href="/wiki/Building_codes" title="Building codes" class="mw-redirect">building codes</a> at the time), administrative and storage buildings, and homes for the leadership and important visitors.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing controversy concerning whether or not David Koresh and his followers truly represented the reform movement that had been in existence for over 60 years at the time of the <a href="/wiki/Siege" title="Siege">siege</a>, and whether or not they had a right to use the name and property of the church. Though his followers numbered around 140 at the time of the siege, only about 20 of them and their children were associated with the church before he drew them away to follow his unique teachings and practices. A much greater number of the loosely organized church rejected his claims.</p>

<p>On February 27, 1993 the <a href="/wiki/Waco_Tribune-Herald" title="Waco Tribune-Herald">Waco Tribune-Herald</a> began the “Sinful Messiah” series of articles. It began, "If you are a Branch Davidian, Christ lives on a threadbare piece of land 10 miles east of here called Mount Carmel. He has dimples, claims a ninth-grade education, married his legal wife when she was 14, enjoys a beer now and then, plays a mean guitar, reportedly packs a <a href="/wiki/Glock_pistol" title="Glock pistol">9mm Glock</a> and keeps an <a href="/wiki/Arsenal" title="Arsenal">arsenal</a> of military <a href="/wiki/Assault_rifle" title="Assault rifle">assault rifles</a>, and willingly admits that he is a sinner without equal."</p>
<p>The article alleged that Koresh had physically abused children in the compound and had taken multiple underage "brides" amounting to statutory rape. Koresh was also said to advocate <a href="/wiki/Polygamy" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> for himself, and declared himself married to several female residents of the small community. According to the paper, Koresh declared he was entitled to at least 140 wives, that he was entitled to claim any of the females in the group as his, that he had fathered at least a dozen children by the <a href="/wiki/Harem" title="Harem">harem</a> and that some of these mothers became brides as young as 12 or 13 years old.</p>
<p>Reports from Joyce Sparks, an investigator from the <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> agency responsible for protective services, stated she had found significant evidence that the allegations were true in her visits to the Mount Carmel site over a period of months. However, she said the investigation was difficult, as she wasn't permitted to speak with the children alone, nor was she permitted to inspect all areas of the site. She noted that safety concerns over construction sites at Mount Carmel were either ignored or slowly corrected.</p>
<p>During the siege, the <a href="/wiki/Deprogramming" title="Deprogramming">deprogrammer</a> <a href="/wiki/Rick_Ross_(consultant)" title="Rick Ross (consultant)">Rick Ross</a> said, "[Koresh is] your stock <a href="/wiki/Cult" title="Cult">cult</a> leader. ... They're all the same. Meet one and you've met them all. They're deeply disturbed, have a <a href="/wiki/Borderline_personality" title="Borderline personality" class="mw-redirect">borderline personality</a> and lack any type of conscience. ... No one willingly enters into a relationship like this. ... So you're talking about deception and manipulation (by the leader), people being coached in ever so slight increments, pulled in deeper and deeper without knowing where it's going or seeing the total picture." Rick Ross also advised the ATF that arresting Koresh at Mt. Carmel would likely provoke a violent response; Joyce Sparks also advised ATF against such action.</p>
<p>Besides allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct, Koresh and his followers were accused of stockpiling illegal weapons. Authorities investigated these charges and obtained a warrant to search Koresh's compound.</p>
<p>Interviews with Koresh's surviving followers reveal that David Koresh was intimately versed in the Bible and "knew it like he wrote it". Koresh taught that the <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">U.S. government</a> was the enemy of the Davidians, and that they would have to defend themselves against it with weapons.</p>
<p>In a video made by Koresh's followers and released during the siege, Koresh stated he'd been told by God to <a href="/wiki/Procreation" title="Procreation" class="mw-redirect">procreate</a> with the women in the group to establish a "House of David," his "Special People." This involved married couples in the group dissolving their marriages and agreeing that only Koresh could have sexual relations with the wives. On the tape, Koresh is also shown with several <a href="/wiki/Minor_(law)" title="Minor (law)">minors</a> who claimed to have had babies fathered by Koresh. In total, Koresh had 14 children who stayed with him in the compound.</p>
<p>A video clip of an interview between Koresh and an Australian television station notes that he was accused of impregnating the aged widow of the founder of Branch Davidianism. He sarcastically said that if the charges were true, if he had "made a 62 year-old woman pregnant... I do miracles, I'm God!" He also stated at that time that he had not had any relationships with her, and called her "an ugly old hag".</p>

<p>In May 1992, Chief Deputy Daniel Weyenberg of the McLennan County Sheriff's Department called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) notifying that his office had been contacted by the local <a href="/wiki/United_Parcel_Service" title="United Parcel Service">United Parcel Service</a> regarding a driver seeing a package that had broken open on delivery to the Branch Davidian residence, revealing that it contained firearms, inert <a href="/wiki/Grenade" title="Grenade" class="mw-redirect">grenade</a> casings, and black powder. On June 9, 1992 a formal investigation was opened and a week later it was classified as sensitive, "<i>thereby calling for a high degree of oversight</i>" from both <a href="/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a> and Headquarters (italics on the original).<sup id="cite_ref-federal_activities_investigation_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-federal_activities_investigation-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-why_act_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-why_act-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The documentary <i>Inside Waco</i> claims that the investigation started when in 1992 the ATF became concerned over reports of <a href="/wiki/Automatic_weapon" title="Automatic weapon" class="mw-redirect">automatic gunfire</a> coming from the Carmel compound.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The ATF began <a href="/wiki/Surveillance" title="Surveillance">surveillance</a> from a house across the road from the compound several months before the siege, but their cover was noticeably poor (the "college students" were in their 30s, not registered at the local schools, and they did not keep a schedule which would have fit any legitimate employment or classes).<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Subsequent investigations, including sending in one agent, Robert Rodriguez, undercover (whose identity Koresh learned, though he chose not to reveal that fact until the day of the raid), revealed that there were over 150 weapons and 8,000 rounds of ammunition in the compound. The weapons were in fact legal <a href="/wiki/Semi-automatic_firearm" title="Semi-automatic firearm">semi-automatics</a>; however, the ATF alleged there were also a number of firearms that had been illegally modified to fire full-automatic.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Davy Aguilera, the ATF agent that had prepared the <a href="/wiki/Affidavit" title="Affidavit">affidavit</a>, testified later in the trial that a neighbor heard machine-gun fire, but Aguilera failed to tell the magistrate that the same neighbor had previously reported the noise to the local Waco <a href="/wiki/Sheriffs_in_the_United_States" title="Sheriffs in the United States">sheriff</a>, who investigated the report. Koresh went to the sheriff and showed him a lawful item called a <a href="/wiki/Hellfire_trigger" title="Hellfire trigger">hellfire device</a>, which allows a semi-automatic firearm to fire at a rate approaching that of fully automatic firearms. The affidavit was approved by a U.S. magistrate and was used as a basis for warrants.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Alleging that the Davidians had violated <a href="/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States" title="Law of the United States">federal law</a>, the ATF obtained <a href="/wiki/Search_warrant" title="Search warrant">search</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arrest_warrant" title="Arrest warrant">arrest warrants</a> for Koresh and specific followers on <a href="/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_United_States" title="Gun law in the United States">weapons charges</a> due to the many firearms they had accumulated. ATF had planned their raid for Monday March 1, 1993, with the code name "Showtime".<sup id="cite_ref-insight_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-insight-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> The ATF would later claim that the raid was moved up a day, to Sunday Feb 28, 1993, in response to the Waco Tribune-Herald "Sinful Messiah" article (which the ATF had tried to prevent from being published).<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> However, the plain text of the search warrant said it expired 28 Feb 1993 10:00pm and the Waco Herald Tribune had held off publishing "Sinful Messiah" at the request of the ATF for a month: when the Herald Tribune informed ATF they were finally publishing the series that weekend, the ATF did not request an extension of the delay or raise any objection to the publication. (Many of the ATF press releases on the Waco Siege were written at HQ and given to the news media without consulting the agents actually on the raid.)</p>
<p>Although ATF claimed that Koresh stayed inside the compound and could not be served with a warrant, Koresh was regularly seen jogging along the Waco roads and ate at local restaurants every week.</p>

<p>Despite being personally invited by Koresh on several occasions as early as July 30, 1992 to inspect the Davidians' weapons (eight months before the raid), and refusing, the ATF pursued a strongly confrontational policy. McClennan County Sheriff Harwell was convinced that if ATF had simply called Koresh, he would have shown at the county courthouse with his lawyer, Wayne Martin. Koresh told people that the <a href="/wiki/Ruby_Ridge_Standoff" title="Ruby Ridge Standoff" class="mw-redirect">Ruby Ridge Standoff</a> of 21-31 Aug 1992 convinced him that the reason ATF refused his request was they were planning a raid regardless of what he did. Between July 1992 and Feb 1993, Koresh's sermons became increasingly apocalyptic.</p>
<p>The Davidian members were well known locally and had cordial relations with other locals. The Davidians partly supported themselves by trading at gun shows and took care always to have the relevant paperwork to ensure their transactions were legal.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Davidian Paul Fattah was a federal firearms licensed dealer (FFL) and the Davidians operated a retail gun business called the Mag Bag: the morning of the raid, Paul Fattah and son Kalani were on their way to the Austin, Texas, gun show to conduct business.</p>

<p>The ATF attempted to execute their search warrant on a Sunday morning, February 28, 1993. Any advantage of surprise was lost as a reporter, who had been tipped off about the raid, asked for directions from a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service" title="United States Postal Service">U.S. Postal Service</a> mail carrier who was Koresh's brother-in-law.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Koresh then told the ATF agent Robert Rodriguez, who had infiltrated the Branch Davidians (to his astonishment as he was not aware that his cover had been blown), that they knew a raid was coming. The agent made an excuse and left the compound. When asked later what the Davidians had been doing when he left the compound, Rodriguez replied, "They were praying". When the ATF rolled up to the front door of the compound, Koresh emerged unarmed and asked what they wanted. For unknown reasons, possibly the accidental discharge of a weapon by a member of the ATF personnel, the ATF opened fire with automatic weapons and Koresh disappeared back inside, injured.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Koresh and his male followers then began arming and taking up defensive positions, while the women and children were told to take cover in their rooms.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> (Agents approached the site in cattle trailers pulled by <a href="/wiki/Pickup_truck" title="Pickup truck">pickup trucks</a> owned by individual ATF agents.

(One door, riddled with bullet holes, was removed and lost very shortly after the siege's end). ATF agents stated that they heard shots coming from within the compound, while Branch Davidian survivors claimed that the first shots came from the ATF agents outside.)</p>
<p>Despite being informed that the Davidians knew the raid was coming, the ATF commander ordered that the raid go ahead, even though their plan had depended on reaching the compound without the Davidians having been armed.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> While not standard procedure, ATF agents had their blood type written on their arms or neck after leaving the staging area and before the raid because it was recommended by the military to facilitate speedy blood transfusions in the case of injury.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-agents_prepared_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-agents_prepared-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Within a minute of the raid starting, the Davidian Wayne Martin, a <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a>-educated lawyer with a wife and 7 children, who for 7 years was an assistant professor at <a href="/wiki/North_Carolina_Central_University" title="North Carolina Central University">North Carolina Central University</a> School of Law, called <a href="/wiki/Emergency_service" title="Emergency service">Emergency services</a>, pleading for them to stop shooting. The resident asked for a <a href="/wiki/Ceasefire" title="Ceasefire">ceasefire</a>, and audiotapes record him saying "Here they come again!" and "That's them shooting, that's not us!"</p>
<p>The local sheriff then attempted to contact the ATF force, but initially could not get through because the ATF communications officer had turned his radio off. Eventually the sheriff got through and negotiated a ceasefire.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> This conflicts with Gazecki's documentary, where the sheriff of McLennan county at the time states that the ATF agents withdrew only once they were out of ammunition."<sup id="cite_ref-roe_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-roe-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After the ceasefire, the Davidians, who still had ample ammunition, allowed the dead and wounded to be removed and held their fire during the ATF retreat. ATF agents Steve Willis, Robert Williams, Todd McKeehan and Conway LeBleu were killed during the raid. Another 16 were wounded. Surviving Davidians claim that some ATF deaths and casualties were caused by 'friendly fire'. The Davidians killed were Winston Blake, Peter Gent, Peter Hipsman, Perry Jones and Jaydean Wendel. Michael Schroeder was shot dead by ATF agents who alleged he fired a pistol at agents as he attempted to re-enter the compound around 5 p.m. with Woodrow Kendrick and Norman Allison.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> His wife claims that he was merely returning from work and had not participated in the day's earlier altercation."<sup id="cite_ref-roe_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-roe-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/wiki/Alan_A._Stone" title="Alan A. Stone">Alan A.

<p>Prior to the ATF siege, relatively few people had heard of the Branch Davidians. During the course of the siege, the media, relying on the input of a host of experts who volunteered services, portrayed the Branch Davidians to be fanatical and, at times, criminal. Interviews conducted within the compound, as well as reports from family members, contradicted this image. Some believe the media hype influenced both the FBI and the ATF and the strategies they employed during the siege.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>Carol Moore, author of the 1994 online report "The Massacre Of The Branch Davidians — A Study Of Government Violations Of Rights, Excessive Force And Cover Up", writes about one of the "experts" quoted by the media, Rick Ross:</p>
<p>One such deprogrammer is Rick Ross, a convicted jewel thief, who has boasted of more than 200 "deprogrammings." ... In the summer of 1993 Rick Ross was <a href="/wiki/Indictment" title="Indictment">indicted</a> in <a href="/wiki/Washington_state" title="Washington state" class="mw-redirect">Washington state</a> for unlawful imprisonment. ... Ross definitely deprogrammed one (and possibly more) of the Branch Davidians who fed questionable but damaging <a href="/wiki/Evidence_(law)" title="Evidence (law)">evidence</a> to ATF. He also provided negative information to the Waco Herald-Tribune for its February, 1993, series on the Branch Davidians. The paper quotes Ross declaring, "The group is without a doubt, without any doubt whatsoever, a highly destructive, manipulative cult ... I would liken the group to <a href="/wiki/Jim_Jones" title="Jim Jones">Jim Jones</a>." The authors write, "Ross said he believes Howell (Koresh) is prone to violence ... Speaking out and exposing Howell might bring in the authorities or in some way help those 'being held in that compound through a kind of psychological, emotional slavery and servitude.'" ... Ross bragged on the "Up to the Minute" public television program that he "consulted with ATF agents on the Waco sect and told them about the guns in the compound." On April 19 he told the "<a href="/wiki/Today_Show" title="Today Show" class="mw-redirect">Today Show</a>," "I was a consultant offering ideas, input that was filtered by their team and used when they felt it was appropriate." The <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice" title="United States Department of Justice">Justice Department</a> report mentions a Rick Ross television appearance during the siege where he declared he hoped Koresh would be a coward and surrender rather than end up as a corpse.</p>

<p>ATF agents established contact with Koresh and others inside the compound after they withdrew. The <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> took command soon after as a result of the deaths of federal agents. They placed <a href="/wiki/Jeff_Jamar" title="Jeff Jamar">Jeff Jamar</a>, head of the Bureau's <a href="/wiki/San_Antonio" title="San Antonio">San Antonio</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_FBI_field_offices" title="List of FBI field offices">field office</a>, in charge of the siege. The tactical team was headed by Richard Rogers, who had previously been criticized for his actions at the <a href="/wiki/Ruby_Ridge" title="Ruby Ridge">Ruby Ridge incident</a>.</p>
<p>For the next 51 days, communication with those inside was by telephone by a group of 25 FBI negotiators.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> The final Justice Department report found that negotiators criticized the tactical commanders for undercutting negotiations.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the first few days the FBI believed they had made a breakthrough when they negotiated with Koresh an agreement that the Davidians would peacefully leave the compound in return for a message, recorded by Koresh, being broadcast on national radio.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> The broadcast was made, but Koresh then told negotiators that God had told him to remain in the building and "wait".<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Despite this, soon afterwards negotiators managed to facilitate the release of 19 children, ranging in age from five months to 12 years old, without their parents.<sup id="cite_ref-perrynetworker_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-perrynetworker-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> These children were released in groups of two. This was considered an allusion to <a href="/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a> by Koresh, while 98 people remained in the building.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> The children were then interviewed by the FBI and <a href="/wiki/Texas_Ranger_Division" title="Texas Ranger Division">Texas Rangers</a>, allegedly for hours at a time.<sup id="cite_ref-perrynetworker_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-perrynetworker-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The children had been physically and sexually abused long before the standoff<sup id="cite_ref-child_abuse_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-child_abuse-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup>, and it was one of the key reasons given to both President <a href="/wiki/Bill_Clinton" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Janet_Reno" title="Janet Reno">Janet Reno</a> as justification for launching <a href="/wiki/Tear_gas" title="Tear gas" class="mw-redirect">tear gas</a> on the compound to force the Davidians out.<sup id="cite_ref-lost_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lost-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On day nine the Davidians released a video tape to show the FBI that there were no hostages, but in fact everyone seemingly was staying inside on their own free will. This video also included a message from Koresh.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Videos also showed the 23 children still inside Ranch Apocalypse, and child care professionals on the outside prepared to take care of those children as well as the previous 21 released.<sup id="cite_ref-perrynetworker_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-perrynetworker-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As the siege continued, Koresh negotiated more time, allegedly so he could write religious documents he said he needed to complete before he surrendered. His conversations, dense with biblical imagery, alienated the federal negotiators who treated the situation as a hostage crisis.</p>
<p>As the siege wore on, two factions developed within the FBI,<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> one believing negotiation to be the answer, the other, force. Increasingly aggressive techniques were used to try to make the Davidians leave. Outside the compound nine disarmed <a href="/wiki/Bradley_Fighting_Vehicles" title="Bradley Fighting Vehicles" class="mw-redirect">Bradley Fighting Vehicles</a> and five <a href="/wiki/M728_Combat_Engineer_Vehicle" title="M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle">M-60 combat engineering vehicles</a> (CEVs) obtained from the US Army began patrolling.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> The armored vehicles were used to destroy perimeter fencing and outbuildings and crush cars and children's bicycles belonging to the Davidians. Music (heavily distorted) and disturbing sounds including the squeals of a rabbit being slaughtered<sup id="cite_ref-lost_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-lost-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> were played at very high volume.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Eventually all power and water was cut to the compound and 2 of the 3 water storage tanks on the roof of the main building were shot at and holed, forcing those inside to survive on rain water and stockpiled <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Meal,_Ready-to-Eat" title="Meal, Ready-to-Eat">Meal, Ready-to-Eat</a> rations.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Criticism was later leveled at the tactic of using sleep and peace-disrupting sound against the Davidians by Schneider's attorney, Jack Zimmerman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point was this - they were trying to have sleep disturbance and they were trying to take someone that they viewed as unstable to start with, and they were trying to drive him crazy. And then they got mad 'cos he does something that they think is irrational!<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the increasingly aggressive tactics, Koresh ordered a group of followers to leave. Eleven people left and were arrested as material witnesses, with one person charged with conspiracy to murder.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The children's willingness to stay with Koresh disturbed the negotiators who were unprepared to work around the Davidians' religious zeal. However, as the siege went on, the children were aware that an earlier group of children who had left with some women were immediately separated, and the women arrested.</p>
<p>During the siege a number of scholars who study <a href="/wiki/Apocalypticism" title="Apocalypticism">Apocalypticism</a> in religious groups attempted to persuade the FBI that the siege tactics being used by government agents would only create the impression within the Davidians that they were part of a Biblical "end-of-times" confrontation that had cosmic significance.<sup id="cite_ref-usatodayreligion_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-usatodayreligion-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> This would likely increase the chances of a violent and deadly outcome. The religious scholars pointed out that while on the outside, the beliefs of the group may have appeared to be extreme, to the Davidians, their religious beliefs were deeply meaningful, and they were willing to die for them.<sup id="cite_ref-usatodayreligion_30-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-usatodayreligion-30" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Koresh's discussions with the negotiating team became increasingly difficult. He proclaimed that he was the second coming of Christ and had been commanded by his father in heaven to remain in the compound.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The FBI suggested that the Davidians might commit mass suicide, as had happened at <a href="/wiki/Jonestown" title="Jonestown">Jonestown</a> where 900 people killed themselves at their leader's behest, although Koresh had repeatedly denied any plans for this when confronted by negotiators during the standoff, and people escaping the compound hadn't seen any such preparation.<sup id="cite_ref-deputy_suicide_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-deputy_suicide-31" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> The newly appointed U.S. <a href="/wiki/Attorney_General" title="Attorney General" class="mw-redirect">Attorney General</a> <a href="/wiki/Janet_Reno" title="Janet Reno">Janet Reno</a> approved recommendations by the FBI to mount an assault after being told that conditions were deteriorating and that children were being abused inside the compound.<sup id="cite_ref-child_abuse_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-child_abuse-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> Because the Davidians were heavily armed, the FBI's arms included .50 caliber (12.7&#160;mm) rifles and armored vehicles (CEVs). The assault took place on April 19.</p>
<p>Combat Engineering tanks used booms to puncture holes in the walls of buildings of the compound so as to pump in <a href="/wiki/CS_gas" title="CS gas">CS gas</a> ("tear gas") and try to flush out the Davidians without harming them. The stated plan called for increasing amounts of gas to be pumped in over two days to increase pressure. Officially, no armed assault was to be made, and loudspeakers were used to tell the Davidians that there would be no armed assault and to ask them not to fire on the vehicles. When several Davidians allegedly opened fire, the FBI's response was to increase the amount of gas being used.<sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After more than six hours no Davidians had left the building, sheltering instead in a cinder block room within the building or using gas masks.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> The official FBI claim is that CEVs were used to punch large holes in the building to provide exits for those inside. Most Davidians dispute this claim because the "exits" were blocked by debris, structurally unstable, elevated and largely inaccessible due to smoke and large quantities of tear gas.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since December 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Several Davidians were blocked when a floor above collapsed, and nearly all Davidians said they feared being shot were they to leave.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since May 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>At around noon, three fires were deliberately started by Davidians almost simultaneously in different parts of the building.<sup id="cite_ref-deputy_fire_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-deputy_fire-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> As the fire spread, Davidians were prevented from escaping; others refused to leave and eventually became trapped. In all, only nine people left the building during the fire.<sup id="cite_ref-deputy_fire_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-deputy_fire-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-iw_17-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-iw-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The remaining Davidians, including children, were either buried alive by rubble caused by the fire, or shot by their own side (the position of the bodies suggests that some of them were 'mercy killed' by their own Davidian people).<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since January 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Only one person shooting from the tower was shot by a ATF sniper<sup id="cite_ref-deputy_fire_33-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-deputy_fire-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup>).

Footage of the incident was being broadcast worldwide via television. In all, 75 died (50 adults and 25 children under the age of 15), 9 survived the fire, 5 were killed and buried between the initial assault and standoff, and 35 had already left during the standoff.<sup id="cite_ref-deputy_fire_33-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-deputy_fire-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Nothing remains of the buildings today, as the entire site was bulldozed by the ATF two weeks after the end of the siege.

<p>The events at Waco spurred both criminal prosecution and civil litigation. On August 3, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a superseding 10-count indictment against twelve of the surviving Davidians. The grand jury charged, among other things, that the Davidians had conspired to, and aided and abetted in, murder of federal officers, and had unlawfully possessed and used various firearms.</p>
<p>The Government dismissed the charges against one of the twelve Davidians, Kathryn Schroeder, pursuant to a plea bargain. After a jury trial lasting nearly two months, the jury acquitted four of the Davidians on all counts with which they were charged. Additionally, the jury acquitted all of the Davidians on the murder-related charges, but convicted five of them on the lesser-included offense of aiding and abetting the voluntary manslaughter of federal agents.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Eight Davidians were convicted on firearms charges.</p>

<p>24 British nationals were among the 76 fatalities. Two more British nationals who survived the massacre were immediately arrested as "material witnesses" and imprisoned without trial for months.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> One, Derek Lovelock, was held in McLennan County Jail for seven months, often in solitary confinement.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> Livingston Fagan, another British citizen, who was among those convicted and imprisoned, recounts multiple beatings at the hands of prison guards, particularly at Leavenworth. He claims to have been doused with cold water from a high-pressure hose, which soaked both him and the contents and bedding of his cell, after which an industrial fan was placed outside the cell, blasting him with cold air. He was repeatedly moved between at least nine different facilities. He was strip-searched every time he took exercise, so refused exercise. Released and deported back to UK in July 2007, he still holds on to his religious beliefs.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> Six of the eight Davidians appealed both their sentences and their convictions. They raised a host of issues, challenging the constitutionality of the prohibition on possession of machine guns, the jury instructions, the district court’s conduct of the trial, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the sentences imposed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the defendants’ sentences for use of machine guns, determining that the district court had made no finding that they had “actively employed” the weapons. The Court of Appeals left the verdict undisturbed in all other respects.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> United States v. Branch, 91 F.3d 699 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. denied (1997).</p>
<p>On remand, the district court found that the defendants had actively employed machine guns, and re-sentenced five of them to substantial prison terms. The defendants again appealed. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. United States v. Castillo, 179 F.3d 321 (5th Cir. 1999). The Davidians pressed this issue before the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the term “machine gun” in the relevant statute created an element of the offense to be determined by a jury, rather than a sentencing factor to be determined by a judge, as had happened in the trial court. Castillo v. United States, 530 U.S. 120 (2000). On September 19, 2000 Judge Walter Smith followed the Supreme Court's instructions and cut 25 years from the sentences of 5 convicted Davidians and five years from the sentence of another.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> All Davidians were released from prison as of July 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Several of the surviving Davidians, as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation, brought civil suits against the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Government" title="United States Government" class="mw-redirect">United States Government</a>, numerous federal officials, the former governor of Texas, and members of the Texas National Guard. They sought monetary damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”), civil rights statutes, the <a href="/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act" title="Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a>, and Texas state law. The bulk of these claims were dismissed because they were insufficient as a matter of law or because the plaintiffs could advance no material evidence in support of them. Only FTCA claims related to the initial raid on the compound, the actions of the FBI during the insertion of tear gas on April 19, 1993, and the final fire proceeded to trial.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>The court, after a month-long trial, rejected the Davidians’ case. The court found that, on February 28, 1993, the Davidians initiated a gun battle when they fired at federal officers who were attempting to serve lawful warrants<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since March 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup>. ATF agents returned gunfire to the building, the court ruled, in order to protect themselves and other agents from death or serious bodily harm. The court found that the government's planning of the siege – i.e. the decisions to use tear gas against the Davidians; to insert the tear gas by means of military tanks; and to omit specific planning for the possibility that a fire would erupt – was a discretionary function for which the government could not be sued. The court also found that the use of tear gas was not negligent. Further, even if the United States Government were negligent by causing damage to the buildings before the fires broke out, thus either blocking escape routes or enabling the fires to speed faster, that negligence did not legally cause the plaintiffs' injuries because the Davidians started the fires. The court found that the FBI's decision not initially to allow fire trucks on the property was reasonable because of the risk of injury or death to firefighters who might encounter hostile gunfire from the Davidian building.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>The Davidians appealed. Their only serious contention was that the trial court judge, Walter S. Smith, Jr., should have recused himself from hearing their claims on account of his relationships with defendants, defense counsel, and court staff; prior judicial determinations; and comments during trial. The Fifth Circuit concluded that these allegations did not reflect conduct that would cause a reasonable observer to question Judge Smith’s impartiality, and it affirmed the take-nothing judgment.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since November 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Andrade v.

While the official version of events has always stated that the helicopters were merely used as a diversion, and that the Davidians were not targeted by sharpshooters within them, in transcripts of the negotiations, one negotiator admitted that the occupants were armed and that they might have opened fire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Koresh: "No! Let me tell you something. That may be what you want the media to believe, but there's other people that saw too! Now, tell me Jim, again - you're honestly going to say those helicopters didn't fire on any of us?"<br />

</blockquote>
<p>An <i>Austin Chronicle</i> article noted, "Long before the fire, the Davidians were discussing the evidence contained in the doors. During the siege, in a phone conversation with the FBI, Steve Schneider, one of Koresh's main confidants, told FBI agents that "the evidence from the front door will clearly show how many bullets and what happened." <sup id="cite_ref-missingdoor_48-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-missingdoor-48" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin, who went inside Mount Carmel during the siege, testified at the trial that protruding metal on the inside of the right-hand entry door made it clear that the bullet holes were made by incoming rounds. DeGuerin also testified that only the right-hand entry door had bullet holes, while the left-hand entry door was intact. The government presented the left-hand entry door at the trial, claiming that the right-hand entry door had been lost. The left-hand door contained numerous bullet holes made by both outgoing and incoming rounds. Texas Trooper Sgt. David Keys testified that he witnessed two men loading what could have been the missing door into a U-Haul van shortly after the siege had ended, but he did not see the object itself. And Michael Caddell, the lead attorney for the Davidians' wrongful death lawsuit explained, "The fact that the left-hand door is in the condition it's in tells you that the right-hand door was not consumed by the fire. It was lost on purpose by somebody." Caddell offered no evidence to support this allegation, which has never been proved. <sup id="cite_ref-missingdoor_48-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-missingdoor-48" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> However, fire investigators<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="The text preceeding this tag needs specification&#160;since April 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">specify</a></i>]</span></sup> stated that it was "extremely unlikely" that the steel right door could have suffered damage in the fire much greater than did the steel left door, and both doors would have been found together.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> The right door remains missing, and the entire site was under close supervision by law enforcement officials until the debris -- including both doors -- had been removed.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since April 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<p>According to Alan A.

<p>The Waco siege has been the subject of a number of documentary <a href="/wiki/Film" title="Film">films</a>:</p>
<p>The first documentary was a made for television film, <i>In the Line of Duty: Ambush at Waco</i>, which was made before the final assault on the church and essentially promoted the government's view of the initial ambush. The scriptwriter, Phil Penningroth, has since disowned his screenplay.</p>
<p>The first documentary film that was critical of the official reports was <i>Waco: The Big Lie</i>, <sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> produced by <a href="/wiki/Linda_Thompson_(attorney)" title="Linda Thompson (attorney)">Linda Thompson</a> followed by <i>Waco II: The Big Lie Continues</i>. The Linda Thompson videos were controversial and made a number of allegations, the most famous of which was footage of a tank with what appears to be light reflected from it; Thompson's narration claimed this was a flame-thrower attached to the tank. Thompson's subsequent activities, such as declaring an armed march on <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> and her denunciation of many other researchers into the Waco siege as part of a cover-up, limited her credibility in most circles.</p>
<p>Michael McNulty, of the Citizens' Organization for Public Safety, released footage showing the "flame" to have been a reflection on aluminized insulation that was torn from the wall and snagged on the <a href="/wiki/M728" title="M728" class="mw-redirect">M728</a> CEV, which is a vehicle that does not come equipped with a flamethrower. In fact, no flamethrowers were in service in the US military at the time or even today.</p>
<p>Thompson's "creative editing" was exposed by the film <i>Waco: An Apparent Deviation</i> (produced by Michael McNulty, as the result of a comprehensive investigation by people associated with COPS).</p>
<p>The next film was <i>Day 51: The True Story of Waco</i>, which featured <a href="/wiki/Ron_Cole" title="Ron Cole">Ron Cole</a>, a self-proclaimed <a href="/wiki/Militia" title="Militia">militia</a> member from <a href="/wiki/Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> who was later prosecuted for weapons violations. <sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="&#160;since August 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Dead_external_links" title="Wikipedia:Dead external links">dead link</a></i>]</span></sup> The Linda Thompson and Ron Cole films, along with extensive coverage given to the Waco siege on some <a href="/wiki/Talk_radio" title="Talk radio">talk radio</a> shows, galvanized support for the Branch Davidians among some sections of the <a href="/wiki/Right-wing_politics" title="Right-wing politics">right</a> including the Nascent Militia Movement, while critics on the <a href="/wiki/Left-wing_politics" title="Left-wing politics">left</a> also denounced the government siege on <a href="/wiki/Civil_liberties" title="Civil liberties">civil liberties</a> grounds.</p>

The film features footage of the Congressional hearings on Waco, and juxtaposition of official government spokespeople with footage and evidence often directly contradicting the government spokespeople. The documentary also shows infra-red footage demonstrating that the FBI likely used incendiary devices to start the fire which consumed the building and that the FBI did indeed fire on, and kill, Branch Davidians attempting to flee the fire.</p>
<p><i>Waco: The Rules of Engagement</i> was nominated for a 1997 <a href="/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards" class="mw-redirect">Academy Award</a> for best documentary and was followed by another film: <a href="/wiki/Waco:_A_New_Revelation" title="Waco: A New Revelation">Waco: A New Revelation</a>. <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58" title=""><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Infra-red experts continue to disagree, and film maker Amy Sommer stands by the original conclusions presented in the <i>Waco: The Rules of Engagement</i> documentary.</p>
<p><i>America Wake Up (Or Waco)</i> was another film released in 2000 by <a href="/wiki/Alex_Jones_(radio)" title="Alex Jones (radio)" class="mw-redirect">Alex Jones</a> which documents the 1993 Waco incident with the Branch Davidians.</p>

The song refers to David Koresh's claim that his was "the Chosen One", and the events that led to the Waco Siege.</p>
<p><i>The Assault on Waco</i> was released on September 16, 2006 on the Discovery channel, and it details the entire attack on Waco.</p>
<p>Professor Kenneth Newport's book, "The Branch Davidians of Waco" (2006), claims that starting the fire themselves was consistent with the Branch Davidians' theology.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Waco_Siege&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" title="Edit section: Investigation and the Danforth Report">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Investigation and the Danforth Report</span></h2>
<p>By 1999, as a result of certain aspects of the documentaries discussed above, as well as allegations made by advocates for Davidians during litigation, public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco. A Time magazine poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex. In September of that year, Attorney General <a href="/wiki/Janet_Reno" title="Janet Reno">Janet Reno</a> appointed former United States Senator <a href="/wiki/John_C._Danforth" title="John C. Danforth" class="mw-redirect">John C. Danforth</a> as <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_Justice_Office_of_Special_Counsel" title="U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel">Special Counsel</a> to investigate the matter. In particular, the Special Counsel was directed to investigate charges that government agents started or spread the fire at the Mt. Carmel complex, directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians, and unlawfully employed the armed forces of the United States.</p>
<p>A yearlong investigation ensued, during which the Office of the Special Counsel interviewed 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence. In the final <a href="/w/index.php?title=Danforth_Report&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Danforth Report (page does not exist)">Danforth Report</a> of November 8, 2000, Special Counsel Danforth concluded that the allegations were meritless. The report found, however, that certain government employees had failed to disclose during litigation against the Davidians the use of pyrotechnic devices at the complex, and had obstructed the Special Counsel’s investigation. Disciplinary action was pursued against those individuals.</p>
<p>Allegations that the government started the fire were based largely on an FBI agent’s having fired three “pyrotechnic” tear gas rounds, which are delivered with a charge that burns. The Special Counsel concluded that, because the FBI fired the rounds nearly four hours before the fire started, at a concrete construction pit partially filled with water, 75&#160;feet (23&#160;m) away and downwind from the main living quarters of the complex, the rounds did not start or contribute to the spread of the fire. The Special Counsel noted, by contrast, that recorded interceptions of Davidian conversations included such statements as “David said we have to get the fuel on” and “So we light it first when they come in with the tank right . . . right as they’re coming in.” Davidians who survived the fire acknowledged that other Davidians started the fire. FBI agents witnessed Davidians pouring fuel and igniting a fire, and noted these observations contemporaneously. Lab analysis found accelerants on the clothing of Davidians, and investigators found deliberately punctured fuel cans and a homemade torch at the site. Based on this evidence and testimony, the Special Counsel concluded that the fire was started by the Davidians.</p>
<p>Charges that government agents fired shots into the complex on April 19, 1993, were based on <a href="/wiki/Forward_Looking_Infrared" title="Forward Looking Infrared" class="mw-redirect">Forward Looking Infrared</a> (“FLIR”) video recorded by FBI Nightstalker aircraft. These tapes showed 57 flashes, with some occurring around government vehicles that were operating near the complex. The Office of Special Counsel conducted a field test of FLIR technology on March 19, 2000, to determine whether gunfire caused the flashes. The testing was conducted under a protocol agreed to and signed by attorneys and experts for the Davidians and their families, as well as for the government. Analysis of the shape, duration, and location of the flashes indicated that they resulted from a reflection off debris on or around the complex, rather than gunfire. Additionally, independent expert review of photography taken at the scene showed no people at or near the points from which the flashes emanated. Interviews of Davidians, government witnesses, filmmakers, writers, and advocates for the Davidians found that none had witnessed any government gunfire on April 19. Finally, none of the Davidians who died on that day displayed evidence of having been struck by a high velocity round, as would be expected had they been shot from outside of the complex by government sniper rifles or other assault weapons. In view of this evidence, the Special Counsel concluded that the claim that government gunfire occurred on April 19, 1993, amounted to “an unsupportable case based entirely upon flawed technological assumptions.”</p>
<p>The Special Counsel considered whether the use of active duty military at Waco violated the <a href="/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act" title="Posse Comitatus Act">Posse Comitatus Act</a> or the Military Assistance to Law Enforcement Act. These statutes generally prohibit direct military participation in law enforcement functions, but do not preclude indirect support such as loaning equipment, training in the use of equipment, offering expert advice, and providing equipment maintenance. The Special Counsel noted that the military provided “extensive” loans of equipment to the ATF and FBI including, among other things, two tanks the offensive capability of which had been disabled. Additionally, the military provided more limited advice, training, and medical support. The Special Counsel concluded that these actions amounted to indirect military assistance within the bounds of applicable law. The Texas <a href="/wiki/United_States_National_Guard" title="United States National Guard" class="mw-redirect">National Guard</a>, in its state status, also provided substantial loans of military equipment, as well as performing reconnaissance flights over the Davidian complex. Because the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the National Guard in its state status, the Special Counsel determined that the National Guard lawfully provided its assistance.</p>

<p>The introduction to the Danforth Report notes that it is focussed on answering two questions about FBI conduct on Day 51 of the siege, 19 Apr 1993: first, did FBI use incendiary devices that could have ignited the fire (as alleged by Assistant US Attorney Bill Johnston in a letter to US Attorney General Janet Reno); second, did FBI direct small arms fire at the Davidians (as alleged by documentary filmmaker Mike McNulty in <i>Waco: The Rules of Engagement</i>). Evidence concerning these allegations by Johnston and McNulty is in the Texas Rangers Branch Davidian Evidence Reports.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title=""><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup> The FBI fired a few hundred 40&#160;mm Ferret gas grenades into the building and Davidian survivor Clive Doyle witnessed a fellow Davidian hit in the face with a 40&#160;mm gas grenade. The introduction to the Danforth report states that the gas grenades did not count as small arms fire even though the Texas Rangers had documentation that 40&#160;mm Ferret will penetrate plywood siding.</p>

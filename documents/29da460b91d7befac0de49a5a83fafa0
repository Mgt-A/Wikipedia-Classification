<p>The <b>Stonewall riots</b> were spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969 at the <a href="/wiki/Stonewall_Inn" title="Stonewall Inn">Stonewall Inn</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a> neighborhood of <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when <a href="/wiki/Gay" title="Gay">gays</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lesbian" title="Lesbian">lesbians</a> fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted homosexuals and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the <a href="/wiki/Gay_rights_movement" title="Gay rights movement" class="mw-redirect">gay rights movement</a> in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>American gays and lesbians in the 1950s and 1960s faced a legal system more anti-homosexual than those of some <a href="/wiki/Warsaw_Pact" title="Warsaw Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> countries.<sup id="cite_ref-carter15_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carter15-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>note 1<span>]</span></a></sup> Early <a href="/wiki/Homophile" title="Homophile">homophile</a> groups in the U.S. sought to prove that gay people could be assimilated into society, and they favored non-confrontational education for homosexuals and heterosexuals alike. The last years of the 1960s, however, were very contentious, as many social movements were active, including the <a href="/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_(1955-1968)" title="African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)" class="mw-redirect">African American Civil Rights Movement</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s" title="Counterculture of the 1960s">Counterculture of the 1960s</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War" title="Opposition to the Vietnam War">antiwar demonstrations</a>. These influences, along with the liberal environment of Greenwich Village, served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.</p>
<p>Very few establishments welcomed openly gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay. The Stonewall Inn, at the time, was owned by the <a href="/wiki/American_Mafia" title="American Mafia">Mafia</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-duberman183_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-duberman183-3" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> It catered to an assortment of patrons, but it was known to be popular with the most marginalized people in the gay community: <a href="/wiki/Transvestism" title="Transvestism">transvestites</a>, effeminate young men, <a href="/wiki/Hustler_(disambiguation)#Slang" title="Hustler (disambiguation)">hustlers</a>, and homeless youth. Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn, and attracted a crowd that was incited to <a href="/wiki/Riot" title="Riot">riot</a>. Tensions between <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" title="New York City Police Department">New York City police</a> and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gays and lesbians to be open about their sexual orientation without fear of being arrested.</p>
<p>After the Stonewall riots, gays and lesbians in New York City faced gender, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gays and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world. On June 28, 1970, the first <a href="/wiki/Pride_parade_(LGBT_community)" title="Pride parade (LGBT community)" class="mw-redirect">Gay Pride marches</a> took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco commemorating the anniversary of the riots. Similar marches were organized in other cities; today Gay Pride events are held annually throughout the world toward the end of June to mark the Stonewall riots.<sup id="cite_ref-pride_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pride-5" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Following the social upheaval of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, many people in the United States felt a fervent desire to "restore the prewar social order and hold off the forces of change", according to historian Barry Adam.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Spurred by the national emphasis on <a href="/wiki/Anti-communism" title="Anti-communism">anti-communism</a>, Senator <a href="/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy" title="Joseph McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> conducted hearings to search for communists in the U.S. government, the U.S. Army, and other government-funded agencies and institutions, leading to a national paranoia. <a href="/wiki/Anarchism" title="Anarchism">Anarchists</a>, <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">communists</a>, and other people deemed un-American and subversive were considered security risks. Homosexuals were included in this list by the <a href="/wiki/U.S._State_Department" title="U.S. State Department" class="mw-redirect">U.S. State Department</a> in 1950, on the theory that they were prone to <a href="/wiki/Blackmail" title="Blackmail">blackmail</a>. <a href="/wiki/Under_Secretary_of_State" title="Under Secretary of State">Under Secretary of State</a> <a href="/wiki/James_E._Webb" title="James E. Webb">James E. Webb</a> noted in a report, "It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Between 1947 and 1950, 1,700&#160;federal job applications were denied, 4,380&#160;people were discharged from the military, and 420 were fired from their government jobs for being suspected homosexuals.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) and police departments kept lists of known homosexuals, their favored establishments, and friends; the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Postal_Service" title="U.S. Postal Service" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Postal Service</a> kept track of addresses where material pertaining to homosexuality was mailed.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> State and local governments followed suit: bars catering to homosexuals were shut down, and their customers were arrested and exposed in newspapers. Cities performed "sweeps" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gays. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Thousands of gay men and lesbians were jailed, fired, or institutionalized in mental hospitals. Many lived double lives, keeping their private lives secret from their professional ones.</p>
<p>In 1952, the <a href="/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association" title="American Psychiatric Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> listed homosexuality in the <i><a href="/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual" title="Diagnostic and Statistical Manual" class="mw-redirect">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual</a></i> (DSM) as a sociopathic personality disturbance. A comprehensive study of homosexuality in 1962 justified inclusion of the disorder as a pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex that was caused by traumatic parent-child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1956, however, <a href="/wiki/Evelyn_Hooker" title="Evelyn Hooker">Evelyn Hooker</a> performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians,<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> but homosexuality remained in the <i>DSM</i> until 1973.</p>

<p>In response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of homosexuals and provide social opportunities where gays and lesbians could socialize without fear of being arrested. <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> area homosexuals created the <a href="/wiki/Mattachine_Society" title="Mattachine Society">Mattachine Society</a> in 1951, in the home of communist activist <a href="/wiki/Harry_Hay" title="Harry Hay">Harry Hay</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist "sexual deviants" with legal troubles.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Facing enormous opposition to its radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gays and lesbians were "normal" people, no different from heterosexuals.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Soon after, several women in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> met in their living rooms to form the <a href="/wiki/Daughters_of_Bilitis" title="Daughters of Bilitis">Daughters of Bilitis</a> (DOB) for lesbians.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One of the first challenges to government repression came in 1953. An organization named ONE published a magazine called <i><a href="/wiki/ONE,_Inc." title="ONE, Inc.">ONE, Inc.</a></i>, that the Postal Service refused to mail. The magazine issue, mailed out in plain brown wrappers, concerned homosexuals in heterosexual marriages; the Postal Service claimed it was obscene. The case eventually <a href="/wiki/One,_Inc._v._Olesen" title="One, Inc. v. Olesen">went to the Supreme Court</a>, which in 1958 ruled that <i>One, Inc.</i> could mail its materials through the U.S. Postal Service.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Homophile" title="Homophile">Homophile</a> organizations—as gay groups were called—grew in number and spread to the East Coast.

<p>The New York neighborhoods of <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a> and <a href="/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a> were home to a sizable gay and lesbian population after <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, when many men and women who had served in the military took advantage of the opportunity to settle in larger cities. The enclaves of gays and lesbians, described by a newspaper story as "short haired women and long haired men", developed a distinct subculture through the following two decades.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> The advent of <a href="/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States" title="Prohibition in the United States">Prohibition</a> inadvertently benefitted gay establishments, as drinking alcohol was pushed underground with other behaviors considered immoral. New York City passed laws against homosexuality in public and private businesses, but because alcohol was in high demand, <a href="/wiki/Speakeasy" title="Speakeasy">speakeasies</a> and impromptu drinking establishments were so numerous and temporary that authorities were unable to police them all.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The social repression of the 1950s resulted in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the <a href="/wiki/Beat_generation" title="Beat generation" class="mw-redirect">Beat</a> poets, wrote about anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures. Of them, <a href="/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> and <a href="/wiki/William_S._Burroughs" title="William S. Burroughs">William S.

<p>By the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor <a href="/wiki/Robert_F._Wagner,_Jr." title="Robert F. Wagner, Jr.">Robert F.

The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Entrapment" title="Entrapment">Entrapment</a> usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for <a href="/wiki/Solicitation" title="Solicitation">solicitation</a>. One story in the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i> described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" title=""><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly elected Mayor <a href="/wiki/John_Lindsay" title="John Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York. They had a more difficult time with the <a href="/wiki/New_York_State_Liquor_Authority" title="New York State Liquor Authority" class="mw-redirect">New York State Liquor Authority</a> (SLA). While no laws prohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving and revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become "disorderly".<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" title=""><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite the high population of gays and lesbians who called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars, where they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested. In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a "sip-in" at a Greenwich Village bar named <a href="/wiki/Julius_(New_York_City)" title="Julius (New York City)">Julius</a>, which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" title=""><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>None of the bars frequented by gays and lesbians were owned by gay people.

<p>The Stonewall Inn, located at 51 and 53 <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Street_(Manhattan)" title="Christopher Street (Manhattan)">Christopher Street</a>, along with several other establishments in the city, was owned by the <a href="/wiki/Genovese_crime_family" title="Genovese crime family">Genovese family</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-duberman183_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-duberman183-3" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1966, three members of the Mafia invested $3,500 to turn the Stonewall Inn into a gay bar, after it had been a restaurant and a nightclub for heterosexuals.

It was the only bar for gay men in New York City where dancing was allowed;<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup> dancing was its main draw since its re-opening as a gay club.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Visitors to the Stonewall in 1969 were greeted by a <a href="/wiki/Bouncer_(doorman)" title="Bouncer (doorman)">bouncer</a> who inspected them through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called "Lily Law", "Alice Blue Gown", or "Betty Badge"<sup id="cite_ref-duberman187_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-duberman187-39" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup>), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private "bottle club", but rarely signed their real names. There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or <a href="/wiki/Black_light" title="Black light">black lights</a>. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching.<sup id="cite_ref-duberman187_39-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-duberman187-39" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by "queens"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could go.<sup id="cite_ref-duberman189_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-duberman189-40" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Only a few <a href="/wiki/Transvestite" title="Transvestite" class="mw-redirect">transvestites</a>, or men in full <a href="/wiki/Drag_(clothing)" title="Drag (clothing)">drag</a>, were allowed in by the bouncers.

<p>Police raids on gay bars were frequent—occurring on average once a month for each bar.

<p>At 1:20 in the morning on Saturday, June 28, 1969, four plainclothes policemen in dark suits, two patrol officers in uniform, and Detective Charles Smythe and Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine arrived at the Stonewall Inn's double doors and announced "Police! We're taking the place!"<sup id="cite_ref-Carter.2C_p._137._49-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Carter.2C_p._137.-49" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50" title=""><span>[</span>note 2<span>]</span></a></sup> Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 200&#160;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused, but a few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms. Police barred the doors, and confusion spread. Michael Fader remembered, "Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar."<sup id="cite_ref-Carter.2C_p._137._49-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Carter.2C_p._137.-49" title=""><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, and separated the transvestites in a room in the back of the bar. Maria (Steve) Ritter recalled, "My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!"<sup id="cite_ref-carter142_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carter142-51" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to "bully" some of the lesbians by "feeling some of them up inappropriately" while frisking them.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52" title=""><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The police were to transport the bar's alcohol in patrol wagons. Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&#160;minutes.<sup id="cite_ref-carter142_51-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carter142-51" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&#160;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: "Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic."<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54" title=""><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, "Gay power!", someone began singing "<a href="/wiki/We_Shall_Overcome" title="We Shall Overcome">We Shall Overcome</a>", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with "growing and intensive hostility".<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

<p>A scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as "a typical New York butch" and "a dyke—stone butch", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a <a href="/wiki/Billy_club" title="Billy club" class="mw-redirect">billy club</a> for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58" title=""><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup> Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown,<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59" title=""><span>[</span>note 3<span>]</span></a></sup> sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, "Why don't you guys do something?" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" title=""><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> the crowd became a mob and went "berserk": "It was at that moment that the scene became explosive".<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" title=""><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The police tried to restrain some of the crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses).<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" title=""><span>[</span>note 4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" title=""><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup> As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled "Let's pay them off!"<sup id="cite_ref-carter156_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-carter156-64" title=""><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted "Pigs!" and "Faggot cops!" Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd, who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600&#160;people, grabbed several people, including folk singer <a href="/wiki/Dave_van_Ronk" title="Dave van Ronk" class="mw-redirect">Dave van Ronk</a>—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: "As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in....

<blockquote>
<p>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration.... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66" title=""><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. <i>The Village Voice</i> writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt <a href="/wiki/Lighter_fluid" title="Lighter fluid">lighter fluid</a> into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived.

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Riot_control" title="Riot control">Tactical Police Force</a> (TPF) of the New York City Police Department arrived to free the police trapped inside the Stonewall. One officer's eye was cut, and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris. Bob Kohler, who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: "I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over.... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because everybody else had rioted ... but the fairies were not supposed to riot ... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill."<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73" title=""><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup> With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon".

<p>Activity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. Craig Rodwell took the opportunity to print and distribute hundreds of leaflets reading: "Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars". The leaflets called for gays to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the "intolerable situation".<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90" title=""><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91" title=""><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Not everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older gays and many members of the <a href="/wiki/Mattachine_Society" title="Mattachine Society">Mattachine Society</a> that had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals ... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap."<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92" title=""><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></a></sup> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a "sleaze joint", as advantageous to the Village.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93" title=""><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On Wednesday, however, <i>The Village Voice</i> ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: "limp wrists" and "Sunday fag follies".<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94" title=""><span>[</span>note 8<span>]</span></a></sup> A mob descended upon Christopher Street once again and threatened to burn down the offices of <i>The Village Voice</i>.

<p>The feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action.

<p>Frank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123" title=""><span>[</span>115<span>]</span></a></sup> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred."<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124" title=""><span>[</span>116<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Similar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as "one of the greatest mistakes of his life".<sup id="cite_ref-clendinen25_125-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clendinen25-125" title=""><span>[</span>117<span>]</span></a></sup> The image of gays retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, "stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals".<sup id="cite_ref-clendinen25_125-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-clendinen25-125" title=""><span>[</span>117<span>]</span></a></sup> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, "Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement....

This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Gittings" title="Barbara Gittings">Barbara Gittings</a> exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist <a href="/wiki/Jean_O%27Leary" title="Jean O'Leary">Jean O'Leary</a> protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by <a href="/wiki/Transvestites" title="Transvestites" class="mw-redirect">transvestites</a> and <a href="/wiki/Drag_queen" title="Drag queen">drag queens</a> in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, <a href="/wiki/Sylvia_Rivera" title="Sylvia Rivera">Sylvia Rivera</a> and Lee Brewster jumped on the stage and shouted "You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and <i>these bitches</i> tell us to quit being ourselves!"<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129" title=""><span>[</span>121<span>]</span></a></sup> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<sup id="cite_ref-duberman236_130-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-duberman236-130" title=""><span>[</span>122<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>O'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transvestites from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transvestites would be too difficult to attain. Sylvia Rivera left gay activism in the 1970s to work on issues for transgender people and transvestites. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now."<sup id="cite_ref-duberman236_130-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-duberman236-130" title=""><span>[</span>122<span>]</span></a></sup> "It was horrible.

<p>The growth of <a href="/wiki/Lesbian_feminism" title="Lesbian feminism">lesbian feminism</a> in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<sup id="cite_ref-faderman211-212_133-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-faderman211-212-133" title=""><span>[</span>125<span>]</span></a></sup> The issues most important to gay men—<a href="/wiki/Entrapment" title="Entrapment">entrapment</a> and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians.

But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Parks" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a>' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-148" title=""><span>[</span>140<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Before the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historian Dudley Clendinen writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else ... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance ... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<sup id="cite_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-149" title=""><span>[</span>141<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historian <a href="/wiki/Lillian_Faderman" title="Lillian Faderman">Lillian Faderman</a> calls the riots the "shot heard round the world", explaining, "The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they."<sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150" title=""><span>[</span>142<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall ... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure.... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin ... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151" title=""><span>[</span>143<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of homosexuals fighting back against police in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, but similarly marginalized people in the gay community started a riot in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> at <a href="/wiki/Compton%27s_Cafeteria_riot" title="Compton's Cafeteria riot">Compton's Cafeteria</a> in 1966, and bars that also served as community centers had been raided, such as Los Angeles's <a href="/wiki/Black_Cat_Tavern" title="Black Cat Tavern">Black Cat Tavern</a> in 1967. However, a number of circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was across the street from <i>The Village Voice</i> offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<sup id="cite_ref-armstrong_122-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-armstrong-122" title=""><span>[</span>114<span>]</span></a></sup> Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community in the weeks and months after the rebellion. The local press and national gay press covered the event extensively. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual <a href="/wiki/Gay_Pride" title="Gay Pride" class="mw-redirect">Gay Pride</a> events around the world.<sup id="cite_ref-armstrong_122-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-armstrong-122" title=""><span>[</span>114<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1994, New York City celebrated "Stonewall 25" with a march that went past the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and into <a href="/wiki/Central_Park" title="Central Park">Central Park</a>. Estimates put the attendance at 1.1&#160;million people.<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152" title=""><span>[</span>144<span>]</span></a></sup> Sylvia Rivera led an alternate march to protest the exclusion of transgender people from the events.<sup id="cite_ref-pride_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pride-5" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Attendance at Gay Pride events has grown substantially over the decades. Most large American cities have some kind of Pride demonstration, as do most large cities around the world. Pride events in some cities mark the largest annual celebration of any kind.<sup id="cite_ref-pride_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pride-5" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The growing trend towards commercializing marches into parades—with events receiving corporate sponsorship—has caused concern about taking away the autonomy of the original grassroots demonstrations that put inexpensive activism in the hands of individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-pride_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pride-5" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In June 1999 the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Department_of_the_Interior" title="U.S. Department of the Interior" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Department of the Interior</a> designated 51 and 53 Christopher Street, the street itself, and the surrounding streets as a <a href="/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark" title="National Historic Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, the first of significance to gays and lesbians. In a dedication ceremony, the Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior stated, "Let it forever be remembered that here—on this spot—men and women stood proud, they stood fast, so that we may be who we are, we may work where we will, live where we choose and love whom our hearts desire."<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153" title=""><span>[</span>145<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<li id="cite_note-2"><b><a href="#cite_ref-2" title="">^</a></b> Every state in the U.S. except for Illinois criminalized homosexual sex between consenting adults in a private home in 1961: "An adult convicted of the crime of having sex with another consenting adult in the privacy of his or her home could get anywhere from a light fine to five, ten, or twenty years—or even life—in prison. In 1971, twenty states had 'sex psychopath' laws that permitted the detaining of homosexuals for that reason alone. In Pennsylvania and California sex offenders could be locked in a mental institution for life, and [in] seven states they could be castrated."(Carter, p. 15) Castration, emetics, hypnosis, electroshock therapy and lobotomies were used by psychiatrists to attempt to "cure" homosexuals of their desires through the 1950s and 1960s.(Katz, p. 181–197.)(Adam, p. 60.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-50"><b><a href="#cite_ref-50" title="">^</a></b> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p. 194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate. Days after the raid, one of the bar owners complained that the tipoff had never come, and that the raid was ordered by the <a href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_and_Firearms" title="Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms" class="mw-redirect">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms</a>, who objected that there were no <a href="/wiki/Revenue_stamp" title="Revenue stamp">stamps</a> on the liquor bottles, indicating the alcohol was <a href="/wiki/Rum-running" title="Rum-running">bootlegged</a>. David Carter presents information (p. 96–103) indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked on <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a>. They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay Wall Street customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently.</li>
<li id="cite_note-59"><b><a href="#cite_ref-59" title="">^</a></b> Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted. Where witnesses claim one woman who fought her treatment at the hands of the police caused the crowd to become angry, some remembered several "butch lesbians" had begun to fight back while still in the bar. At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, p. 152–153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: "there was just ... a flash of group—of mass—anger".</li>
<li id="cite_note-62"><b><a href="#cite_ref-62" title="">^</a></b> Witness Morty Manford stated, "There's no doubt in my mind that those people were deliberately left unguarded. I assume there was some sort of relationship between the bar management and the local police, so they really didn't want to arrest those people. But they had to at least look like they were doing their jobs." (Marcus, p. 128.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-65"><b><a href="#cite_ref-65" title="">^</a></b> In the years since the riots occurred, the death of <a href="/wiki/Gay_icon" title="Gay icon">gay icon</a> <a href="/wiki/Judy_Garland" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</a> earlier in the week on June 22, 1969 has been attributed as a significant factor in the riots, but no participants in Saturday morning's demonstrations recall Garland's name being discussed. No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although Sylvia Rivera recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 26, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, p. 190–191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, "When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing." (Deitcher, p. 72.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-71"><b><a href="#cite_ref-71" title="">^</a></b> Rivera was handed a <a href="/wiki/Molotov_cocktail" title="Molotov cocktail">Molotov cocktail</a> (there were no eyewitness accounts of Molotov cocktails the first night although many fires were set), that she identified only because she had seen them on the news: "I'm like, 'What am I supposed to do with this?' And this guy said, 'Well, I'm going to light it, and you're going to throw it.' And I'm like, 'Fine. You light it, I throw it, 'cause if it blows up, I don't want it to blow up on me.' It's hard to explain, except that it had to happen one day...." (Deitcher, p. 67.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-81"><b><a href="#cite_ref-81" title="">^</a></b> One protester needed stitches to repair a knee broken by a night stick; another lost two fingers in a car door. Witnesses recollect that some of the most "feminine boys" were beaten badly. (Duberman, p. 201–202.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-94"><b><a href="#cite_ref-94" title="">^</a></b> Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at <i>The Village Voice</i> reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery. Author Edmund White insists that Smith and Truscott were trying to assert their own heterosexuality by referring to the events and people in derogatory terms.</li>
<li id="cite_note-103"><b><a href="#cite_ref-103" title="">^</a></b> "Hairpin drop" was <a href="/wiki/Gay_slang" title="Gay slang" class="mw-redirect">gay slang</a> that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</li>

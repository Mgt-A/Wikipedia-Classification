<p>The Dashanzi factory complex began as an extension of the "Socialist Unification Plan" of military-industrial cooperation between the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the newly-formed <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a>. By 1951, 156 "joint factory" projects had been realized under that agreement, part of the <a href="/wiki/Chinese_government" title="Chinese government">Chinese government</a>'s first <a href="/w/index.php?title=Five-year_plans_of_China&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Five-year plans of China (page does not exist)">Five-Year Plan</a>. However the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army" title="People's Liberation Army">People's Liberation Army</a> still had a dire need of modern electronic components, which were produced in only two of the joint factories. The Russians were unwilling to undertake an additional project at the time, and suggested that the Chinese turn to <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East Germany</a> from which much of the Soviet Union's electronics equipment was imported. So at the request of then-Premier <a href="/wiki/Zhou_Enlai" title="Zhou Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a>, scientists and engineers joined the first Chinese trade delegation to East Germany in 1951, visiting a dozen factories. The project was greenlighted in early 1952 and a Chinese preparatory group was sent to <a href="/wiki/East_Berlin" title="East Berlin">East Berlin</a> to prepare design plans. This project, which was to be the largest by East Germany in China, was then informally known as Project #157.</p>
<p>The architectural plans were left to the Germans, who chose a functional <a href="/wiki/Bauhaus" title="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a>-influenced design over the more ornamental <a href="/wiki/Soviet_architecture" title="Soviet architecture" class="mw-redirect">Soviet style</a>, triggering the first of many disputes between the German and Russian consultants on the project. The plans, where <a href="/wiki/Form_follows_function" title="Form follows function">form follows function</a>, called for large indoor spaces designed to let the maximum amount of natural light into the workplace. Arch-supported sections of the ceiling would curve upwards then fall diagonally along the high slanted banks or windows; this pattern would be repeated several times in the larger rooms, giving the roof its characteristic sawtooth-like appearance. Despite Beijing's northern location, the windows were all to face north because the light from that direction would cast fewer shadows.</p>
<p>The chosen location was a 640,000 square metres area in Dashanzi, then a low-lying patch of farmland northeast of Beijing. The complex was to occupy 500,000 square metres, 370,000 of which were allocated to living quarters. It was officially named <b>Joint Factory 718</b>, following the Chinese government's method of naming military factories starting with the number 7. Fully funded by the Chinese side, the initial budget was enormous for the times: 9 million <a href="/wiki/Soviet_ruble" title="Soviet ruble">rubles</a> or approximately 140 million <a href="/wiki/Renminbi" title="Renminbi">RMB</a> (<a href="/wiki/US$" title="US$" class="mw-redirect">US$</a>17 million) at today's rates; actual costs were 147 million RMB.</p>
<p>Ground was broken in April 1954. Construction was marked by disagreements between the Chinese, Soviet and German experts, which led at one point to a six-month postponement of the project. The Germans' harshest critic was the Russian technology consultant in charge of Beijing's two Soviet-built electronics factories (714 and 738), who was also head consultant of the Radio Industrial Office of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry. The disputes generally revolved around the Germans' high but expensive quality standards for buildings and machines, which were called "over-engineering" by the Russians. Among such points of contention was the Germans' insistence, historical seismic data in hand, that the buildings be built to whistand <a href="/wiki/Earthquakes" title="Earthquakes" class="mw-redirect">earthquakes</a> of magnitude 8 on the <a href="/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale" title="Richter magnitude scale">Richter scale</a>, whereas the Chinese and Russians wanted to settle for 7. Communications expert Wang Zheng, head of Communications Industry in the Chinese Ministry of National Defense and supporter the East German bid from the start, ruled in favor of the Germans for this particular factory.</p>
<p>At the height of the construction effort, more than 100 East German foreign experts worked on the project. The resources of as many as 22 of their factories supplied the construction; at the same time, supply delays were caused by the Soviet <a href="/wiki/Red_Army" title="Red Army">Red Army</a>'s tremendous drain on East Germany's industrial production. The equipment was transported directly through the Soviet Union via the <a href="/wiki/Trans-Siberian_railway" title="Trans-Siberian railway" class="mw-redirect">Trans-Siberian railway</a>, and a 15 km track of railroad between <a href="/wiki/Beijing_Railway_Station" title="Beijing Railway Station">Beijing Railway Station</a> and <a href="/wiki/Beijing_east_railway_station" title="Beijing east railway station" class="mw-redirect">Dongjiao Station</a> was built especially to service the factory. US-educated scientist Dr. Luo Peilin (罗沛霖), formerly head of the preparatory group in 1951-1953, was Head Engineer of Joint Factory 718 during its construction phase. Dr. Luo, now retired in Beijing, is remembered by his former colleagues as a dedicated <a href="/wiki/Perfectionist" title="Perfectionist" class="mw-redirect">perfectionist</a> whose commitment to the obstacle-strewn project was a major factor of its eventual success.</p>
<p><a name="Operation" id="Operation"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=798_Art_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Operation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Operation</span></h2>
<p>Joint Factory 718 began production in 1957, amid a grandiose opening ceremony and display of Communist brotherhood between China and East Germany, attended by high officials of both countries. The first director was Li Rui (李瑞), who had been involved in the early negotiations in Berlin.</p>
<p>The factory quickly established a reputation for itself as one of the best in China. Through its several <i>danwei</i> or "<a href="/wiki/Work_unit" title="Work unit">work units</a>", it offered considerable social benefits to its 10,000-20,000 workers, especially considering the relative poverty of the country during such periods as the <a href="/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward" title="Great Leap Forward">Great Leap Forward</a>. The factory boasted, among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>the best housing available to workers in Beijing, providing fully furnished rooms to whole families for less than 1/30 of the workers' income;</li>
<li>diverse extracurricular activities such as social and sporting events, dancing, swimming, and training classes;</li>
<li>its own athletics, soccer, basketball and volleyball teams for men and women, ranked among the best in inter-factory competitions;</li>
<li>a brigade of German-made motorcycles, performing races and stunt demonstrations;</li>
<li>an orchestra that played not only revolutionary hymns, but also German-influenced classical Western music;</li>
<li>literary clubs and publications, and a library furnished with Chinese and foreign (German) books;</li>
<li>Jiuxianqiao hospital, featuring German equipment and offering the most advanced dental facilities in China.</li>
</ul>
<p>The factory even had its own volunteer military reserves or <i>jinweishi</i> (近卫师), which numbered hundreds and were equipped with large-scale weapons and <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft_gun" title="Anti-aircraft gun" class="mw-redirect">anti-aircraft guns</a>.</p>
<p>Workers' skills were honed by frequent personnel exchanges, internships and training in cooperation with East Germany. Different incentives kept motivation high, such as rewards systems and "model worker" distinctions. At the same time, political activities such as <a href="/wiki/Maoism" title="Maoism">Maoism</a> study workshops kept the workers in line with <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" title="Communist Party of China">Communist Party of China</a> doctrine. During the <a href="/wiki/Cultural_revolution" title="Cultural revolution" class="mw-redirect">Cultural revolution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> slogans for <a href="/wiki/Mao_Zedong_Thought" title="Mao Zedong Thought" class="mw-redirect">Mao Zedong Thought</a> were painted on the ceiling arches in bright red characters (where they remain today at the latter tenants' request).</p>
<p>Frequent VIP visits contributed to the festive atmosphere. Notable guests included <a href="/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jiang_Zemin" title="Jiang Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi" title="Liu Shaoqi">Liu Shaoqi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zhu_De" title="Zhu De">Zhu De</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kim_Il-Sung" title="Kim Il-Sung" class="mw-redirect">Kim Il-Sung</a>.</p>
<p>The Joint Factory produced a wide variety of military and civilian equipment. Civilian production included acoustic equipment for Beijing's <a href="/wiki/Workers%27_Stadium" title="Workers' Stadium" class="mw-redirect">Workers' Stadium</a> and <a href="/wiki/Great_Hall_of_the_People" title="Great Hall of the People">Great Hall of the People</a>, as well as all the <a href="/wiki/Loudspeaker" title="Loudspeaker">loudspeakers</a> on <a href="/wiki/Tiananmen_Square" title="Tiananmen Square">Tiananmen Square</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chang%27an_Avenue" title="Chang'an Avenue">Chang'an Avenue</a>.

<p>After 10 years of operation, Joint Factory 718 was split into more manageable components, such as sub-Factories 706, 707, 751, 761, 797 and 798. The first Head of sub-Factory 798 (the largest) was Branch Party Secretary Fu Ke (傅克), who played a major role in recruiting skilled workers from southern China and among returned <a href="/wiki/Overseas_Chinese" title="Overseas Chinese">overseas Chinese</a>.</p>
<p>However, the factory came under pressure during Deng Xiaoping's <a href="/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform" title="Chinese economic reform" class="mw-redirect">reforms</a> of the 1980s. Deprived of governmental support like many <a href="/wiki/State-owned_enterprises" title="State-owned enterprises" class="mw-redirect">state-owned enterprises</a>, it underwent a gradual decline and was eventually rendered obsolete. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, most sub-factories had ceased production, 60% of the workers had been <a href="/wiki/Unemployment" title="Unemployment">laid off</a>, and the remains of the management were reconstituted as a real-estate operation called "Seven-Star Huadian Science and Technology Group", charged with overseeing the industrial park and finding tenants for the abandoned buildings.</p>

<p>The Dashanzi factory complex was vacated at around the time when most of Beijing's contemporary artist community was looking for a new home. <a href="/wiki/Avant-garde" title="Avant-garde">Avant-garde</a> art being frowned upon by the government, the community had traditionally existed on the fringes of the city. From 1984 to 1993, they worked in run-down houses near the <a href="/wiki/Old_Summer_Palace" title="Old Summer Palace">Old Summer Palace</a> (Yuanmingyuan) in northwestern Beijing, until their <a href="/wiki/Eviction" title="Eviction">eviction</a>. They had then moved to the eastern Tongxian County (now <a href="/w/index.php?title=Tongzhou_District,_Beijing&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tongzhou District, Beijing (page does not exist)">Tongzhou District</a>), more than an hour's drive from the city center.</p>
<p>Then in 1995, Beijing's <a href="http://www.cafa.com.cn/asp/index.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.cafa.com.cn/asp/index.asp" rel="nofollow">Central Academy of Fine Arts</a> (CAFA), looking for cheap, ample workshop space away from downtown, set up in the now defunct Factory 706. The temporary move became permanent and in 2000 Sui Jianguo (隋建国), Dean of the Department of <a href="/wiki/Sculpture" title="Sculpture">Sculpture</a>, located his own studio in the area. The cluttered sculpture workshops have always remained open for visitors to peek at the dozens of workers milling about.</p>
<p>In 2001, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texan</a> Robert Bernell moved his <a href="http://www.timezone8.com" class="external text" title="http://www.timezone8.com" rel="nofollow">Timezone 8 Art Books</a> bookshop and publishing office (founded in 1997) into a former factory canteen; he was the first <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/laowai" class="extiw" title="wikt:laowai">foreigner</a> to move in. One of Timezone 8's early employees was fashion designer Xiao Li, who along her husband, performance artist <a href="/wiki/Cang_Xin" title="Cang Xin">Cang Xin</a>, helped artists secure and rent spaces in the area.</p>
<p>Through word-of-mouth, artists and designers started trickling in, attracted to the vast cathedral-like spaces. Despite the lack of any conscious aesthetic in the Bauhaus-inspired style, which grounded architectural beauty in practical, industrial function, the swooping arcs and soaring <a href="/wiki/Chimney" title="Chimney">chimneys</a> had an uplifting effect on modern eyes, a sort of <a href="/wiki/Post-industrial" title="Post-industrial" class="mw-redirect">post-industrial</a> chic. At the artists' requests, workers renovating the spaces preserved the prominent Maoist slogans on the arches, adding a touch of ironic "<a href="/wiki/Mao_Zedong" title="Mao Zedong">Mao</a> <a href="/wiki/Kitsch" title="Kitsch">kitsch</a>" to the place.</p>
<p>Later that year, Mr. Tabata Yukihito from Japan's <a href="http://www.tokyo-gallery.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tokyo-gallery.com" rel="nofollow">Tokyo Gallery</a> set up <a href="http://www.tokyo-gallery.com/btap/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tokyo-gallery.com/btap/index.html" rel="nofollow">Beijing Tokyo Art Projects</a> (BTAP, 北京东京艺术工程) inside a 400-m² division of Factory 798's main area; this was the first renovated space featuring the high arched ceilings that would become synonymous with the Art District. BTAP's 2002 opening exhibition "Beijing Afloat" (<a href="/wiki/Curator" title="Curator">curator</a>: <a href="/wiki/Feng_Boyi" title="Feng Boyi">Feng Boyi</a>), drew a crowd of over 1,000 people and marked the beginning of the popular infatuation with the area.</p>
<p>In 2002, designer artist Huang Rui (黄锐) and <a href="/wiki/Hutong" title="Hutong">hutong</a> photographer Xu Yong (徐勇) set up the <a href="http://www.798space.com" class="external text" title="http://www.798space.com" rel="nofollow">798 Space gallery</a> (时态空间) next to BTAP. With its cavernous 1200-m² floor and multiple-arched ceilings at the center of Factory 798, it was and still is the symbolic center of the whole district. (Huang and Xu since designed at least seven spaces in the area and became the prime movers and <a href="/wiki/De_facto" title="De facto">de facto</a> spokespersons of the District.) A glass-fronted café was set up in the former office section at the back of the 798 space, opening into a back alley now lined with studios and restaurants such as Huang's own At Café, and Cang Xin's #6 <a href="/wiki/Szechuan_cuisine" title="Szechuan cuisine">Sichuan</a> restaurant, the area's "canteen".</p>
<p>In 2003, Lu Jie (卢杰) set up the <a href="http://longmarchfoundation.org" class="external text" title="http://longmarchfoundation.org" rel="nofollow">Long March Foundation</a>, an ongoing project for artistic re-interpretation of the historical <a href="/wiki/Long_March" title="Long March">Long March</a>, inside the 25,000 <a href="/wiki/Chinese_units" title="Chinese units" class="mw-redirect"><i>Li</i></a> Cultural Transmission Center (二万五千里文化传播中心). Around that time, Singapore-owned China Art Seasons (北京季节画廊) opened for display for pan-Asian art, and was one of several new galleries setting up at that time.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=798_Art_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Notable exhibitions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Notable exhibitions</span></h2>
<p>Several <a href="/wiki/Art_exhibition" title="Art exhibition">exhibitions</a> of note took place in 2003. In March, Huang Rui and Shu Yang's "Transborder Language 2003" (curator: <a href="/wiki/Li_Xianting" title="Li Xianting">Li Xianting</a>) combined <a href="/wiki/Poetry" title="Poetry">poetry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Performance_art" title="Performance art">performance art</a>. "Blue Sky Exposure" was held outdoors in southern Beijing and then relocated to the Art District. On April 13, despite widespread fear of public gatherings during <a href="/wiki/SARS" title="SARS" class="mw-redirect">SARS</a>, the exhibitions "Reconstruction 798" (798 space) and "Operation Ink Freedom" (25,000 <i>Li</i> Cultural Transmission Center) drew crowds of 5,000 and definitely confirmed the area's widespread appeal.</p>
<p>In July, with Beijing in full <a href="/wiki/Construction" title="Construction">construction</a> boom, Wang Wei's "Temporary Space" (curator: Philip Tinari) featured workers completely enclosing an area of the exhibition with a brick wall and then removing the bricks one by one. In September, "Left Hand - Right Hand" (curator: <a href="/wiki/Feng_Boyi" title="Feng Boyi">Feng Boyi</a>) showcased Chinese and German sculptors at 798 Space and Daoyaolu Workshop A. Among the works was Sui Jianguo's enormous <a href="/wiki/Concrete" title="Concrete">concrete</a> sculpture "Mao's Right Hand", which is just what the name suggests, and an example of modern Chinese art's ironic reflections on history.</p>
<p>The first <a href="http://www.bjbiennale.com.cn" class="external text" title="http://www.bjbiennale.com.cn" rel="nofollow">Beijing Biennale</a> was held in <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2003-09-18"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="09-18"><a href="/wiki/September_18" title="September 18">September 18</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/2003" title="2003">2003</a></span> at the Art District and featured 14 exhibitions. "Tui-Transfiguration" (curator: Wu Hung; <i>tui</i> here roughly means <i><a href="/wiki/Moult" title="Moult">moult</a></i>) featured photographs by <a href="/w/index.php?title=East_Village_(Beijing)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="East Village (Beijing) (page does not exist)">East Village</a> chronicler Rong Rong (荣荣) and his wife, Japan-born Inri (映里). Their works notably featured their own <a href="/wiki/Nudity" title="Nudity">naked</a> bodies in various strange locales, and were generally well-received despite being criticized by some as typical of the self-centered nature of much art in the area.</p>
<p>The first <a href="http://diaf.vip.myrice.com" class="external text" title="http://diaf.vip.myrice.com" rel="nofollow">Dashanzi International Art Festival</a>, directed by the ever-present Huang Rui, was held from <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="04-24"><a href="/wiki/April_24" title="April 24">April 24</a></span> to <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2004-05-23"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="05-23"><a href="/wiki/May_23" title="May 23">May 23</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/2004" title="2004">2004</a></span>. This first edition, named <i>Radiance and Resonance/Signals of Time</i> (光•音 / 光阴), was beset by logistical problems arising from landowner Seven-Star Group's increasing irritation with the art community. As such, the festival became as much a public protest against the area's upcoming destruction that a showcase of art itself.</p>
<p>One of the most (in)-famous displays at the Festival was performance artist He Yunchang having himself <a href="/wiki/Cement" title="Cement">cemented</a> shut in a wooden box with only two pipes for <a href="/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)" title="Ventilation (architecture)">ventilation</a>, and staying there for 24 hours before being chiseled out, prompting the proverbial "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Is_it_art%3F&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Is it art? (page does not exist)">Is it art?</a>" questionings. "Shock" exhibitions have become increasingly common in the Art District (see <i>China Daily'</i>s article <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/02/content_356928.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/02/content_356928.htm" rel="nofollow">"The avant-garde art goes too far?"</a> for some extreme examples).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=798_Art_Zone&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Gentrification">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gentrification</span></h2>
<p>The district's popularity has exploded since the opening of BTAP and 798 Space in 2002, with scores of <a href="/wiki/Art_gallery" title="Art gallery" class="mw-redirect">galleries</a>, <a href="/wiki/Loft" title="Loft">lofts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Publishing" title="Publishing">publishing</a> firms, <a href="/wiki/Design" title="Design">design</a> companies, high-end <a href="/wiki/Tailor" title="Tailor">tailor</a> shops, and <a href="/wiki/Caf%C3%A9" title="Café">cafés</a> and fancy restaurants setting up. In 2003, around 30 artists and organizations had set up studios or offices in the area, with 200 more reportedly on the waiting list to move in.</p>
<p>Fashionable clubs also sprang up such as Zhou Ying's "Vibes", known for its <a href="/wiki/Fetishism" title="Fetishism">fetish</a> nights. A former factory cafeteria became <a href="http://www.yanclub.com" class="external text" title="http://www.yanclub.com" rel="nofollow">Yan Club</a> (仁俱乐部), owned by well-known Beijing socialite and writer Li Xuebing or "Bing Bing" (冰冰), also owner of <a href="/wiki/Sanlitun" title="Sanlitun">Sanlitun</a>'s Jam House. Notable performers at Yan included <a href="/wiki/Morcheeba" title="Morcheeba">Morcheeba</a> in March 2003.</p>
<p>In keeping with the area's "community spirit", most galleries and spaces in Dashanzi do not charge either exhibitors or visitors. Instead, they generally sustain themselves by hosting profitable fashion shows and corporate events; among others, <a href="/wiki/Sony" title="Sony">Sony</a> had a product launch gala at 798 space, and <a href="/wiki/Watchmaker" title="Watchmaker">watchmaker</a> <a href="/wiki/Omega_SA" title="Omega SA">Omega</a> presented a fashion show at Yan Club. Others include <a href="/wiki/Christian_Dior" title="Christian Dior">Christian Dior</a>, <a href="/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell" title="Royal Dutch Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a> and <a href="/wiki/Toyota" title="Toyota">Toyota</a>; supermodel <a href="/wiki/Cindy_Crawford" title="Cindy Crawford">Cindy Crawford</a> also made an appearance. Even <a href="/wiki/Li_Ka-shing" title="Li Ka-shing">Li Ka-shing</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Cheung_Kong_Holdings" title="Cheung Kong Holdings">Cheung Kong Holdings</a> held an event in the district, which some found unsettling given the real-estate industry's designs on the land it sits on.</p>
<p>As such, Dashanzi is now a center of Beijing's nascent "<a href="/wiki/Bobos_in_Paradise" title="Bobos in Paradise">BoBo</a>" (bourgeois-bohemian) community. Huang Rui and Xu Yong are good representatives of the type. And a local <a href="/wiki/Guru" title="Guru">guru</a> of sorts is artist/curator/architect <a href="/wiki/Ai_Weiwei" title="Ai Weiwei">Ai Weiwei</a> (艾未未), whose self-designed house in Caochangdi just outside the factory complex was a trendsetter. True to BoBo style, he is an icon of <a href="/wiki/Consumerism" title="Consumerism">consumerism</a> as much as <a href="/wiki/Counterculture" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a>, working with <a href="/wiki/Herzog_%26_de_Meuron" title="Herzog &amp; de Meuron">Herzog &amp; de Meuron</a> on the design of the <a href="/wiki/Beijing_National_Stadium" title="Beijing National Stadium">Beijing National Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>In the absence of any <a href="/wiki/Rent_control" title="Rent control">rent control</a>, tenants' costs have escalated. In 2000-2001, rents were 0.8 RMB per square metre per day (24 RMB or US$2.90/m²/month, or about US$0.27/<a href="/wiki/Square_foot" title="Square foot">sq.foot</a>/month). They increased slightly to 30 RMB/m²/month in 2003, and then doubled to 60 RMB/m²/month (US$0.67/sq.foot/month) in 2004. Total costs can be quite high considering the average 200-400 m² area of the spaces, and the overhead of <a href="/wiki/Renovation" title="Renovation">renovating</a> and retrofitting the rooms to use modern appliances.</p>
<p>Another sign of creeping <a href="/wiki/Gentrification" title="Gentrification">gentrification</a> is the increasing number of luxury cars parked near the galleries; local artist Zhao Bandi purchased the first <a href="/wiki/Alfa_Romeo" title="Alfa Romeo">Alfa Romeo</a> convertible in Beijing. Some (but not all) of the resident artists and their patrons are quite rich compared to other occupants of the area, the remaining factory workers. Some of the workshops are still operational on a small scale, mostly doing car repair or industrial laundry.</p>
<p>Some local artists such as Zhang Zhaohui, a New-York trained art critic and curator, and architect Zhu Jun, a new Dashanzi resident, have criticized the Art District as being less about art and more about show. Says Zhang: "Few of the artists come to seriously practice art. Most of them just come for opportunities to exhibit and sell works or just have parties and gatherings." <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/63022.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/63022.htm" rel="nofollow">(<i>China Daily</i>)</a> On the other hand, young artists like Zhang Yue find this atmosphere particularly condusive to establishing one's career. In the course of one summer, Dashanzi Art District's Platform China Contemporary Art Institute and Unlimited Art Gallery afforded this rising artist two well-received solo shows.</p>

<p>In the days of Joint Factory 718, Dashanzi was chosen for its peripheral position well outside the city center. The artists who later moved there were coming from the edges of the city as well. Today however, the area sits right on the strategic corridor between the <a href="/wiki/Beijing_Capital_Airport" title="Beijing Capital Airport" class="mw-redirect">Capital Airport</a> and downtown Beijing along the <a href="/wiki/Airport_Expressway_(Beijing)" title="Airport Expressway (Beijing)">Airport Expressway</a>, considered of vital importance to the <a href="/wiki/2008_Olympic_games" title="2008 Olympic games" class="mw-redirect">2008 Olympic games</a>. In the context of China's current <a href="/wiki/Real_estate" title="Real estate">real estate</a> <a href="/wiki/Bubble_(economics)" title="Bubble (economics)" class="mw-redirect">bubble</a>, the district is highly likely to be destroyed in the near future; the western entrances of the complex are already flanked by the Jiuxian and Hongyuan luxury apartment towers. Current government projects call for the expansion of the neighbouring <a href="/wiki/Industrial_park" title="Industrial park">industrial park</a> to turn all of Dashanzi into a high-tech development zone similar to <a href="/wiki/Zhongguancun" title="Zhongguancun">Zhongguancun</a>. Landowner Seven-Star Group thus hopes to re-employ some of the 10,000 laid-off workers it is still responsible for.</p>
<p>Influential members of the artist community are <a href="/wiki/Lobbying" title="Lobbying">lobbying</a> various government instances to persuade them to allow the old buildings to remain, as part of a cultural center which Beijing otherwise lacks and that can only grow organically. They point out that such communities are important if Beijing, and China, is to become a major source of creative design instead of mere manufacturing. (This issue has far-reaching implications in the domain of <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> protection in China - some experts believe that the local IP laws will start to be enforced only when China becomes a source of its own intellectual property.)</p>
<p>Part of the lobbying effort is resident sculptor Li Xiangqun, professor at the <a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/docsn/msxy/index-en.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/docsn/msxy/index-en.html" rel="nofollow">Academy of Arts and Design</a> of <a href="/wiki/Tsinghua_University" title="Tsinghua University">Tsinghua University</a>, who was elected deputy of the 12th <a href="/wiki/National_People%27s_Congress" title="National People's Congress">National People's Congress</a> in 2004. Li presented the municipal government with a formal bill in February, requesting suspension of the destruction plans and preservation of the buildings as part of an Olympic-caliber cultural center.</p>
<p>Professors from architecture schools such as Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts and the <a href="http://www.sciarc.edu" class="external text" title="http://www.sciarc.edu" rel="nofollow">Southern Californian Institute of Architecture</a> (<a href="/wiki/Southern_California_Institute_of_Architecture" title="Southern California Institute of Architecture">SCI-Arc</a>) have proposed various development plans for the area that involve preserving the buildings, although those do not appear especially profitable financially.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, attempts have been made to appeal to the developers' sense of economics by pointing out similarities with New York's Greenwich Village and SoHo, where the high profitability of real estate is due partly to the presence of former post-industrial artists' dwellings. Those arguments have so far been ignored.</p>
<p>As of 2004, Seven-Star Group has frozen the rental of new spaces and prohibited all renewals. Tenants now resort to subdividing and subleasing their spaces, to which the Group has responded by attempting to forbid subleasing to cultural organizations or to foreigners, hoping to drive out the artists. Tenants, despite some of them having leases still valid for several years, have been given the ultimatum of <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2005-12-31"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="12-31"><a href="/wiki/December_31" title="December 31">December 31</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/2005" title="2005">2005</a></span> to vacate the premises. <a href="http://english.sohu.com/2004/07/05/42/article220864288.shtml" class="external text" title="http://english.sohu.com/2004/07/05/42/article220864288.shtml" rel="nofollow">(<i>China Daily</i>)</a></p>
<p>At the end of 2007 it was decided that the area will continue in its current format.</p>
<p>July 2008: The area is being refurbished and is thriving. The roads have been repaved, new galleries opened as well as a cafe culture emerging.</p>

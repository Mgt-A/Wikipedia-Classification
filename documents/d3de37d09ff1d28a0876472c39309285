<p>The Dicta Boelcke consists of the following 8 rules:<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><b>1.Try to secure the upper hand before attacking. If possible, <a href="/wiki/Sun_position_(air_combat)" title="Sun position (air combat)">keep the sun behind you</a>:</b></p>
<p>'Advantages' for WWI aircraft included <a href="/wiki/Air_speed" title="Air speed" class="mw-redirect">speed</a>, <a href="/wiki/Altitude" title="Altitude">altitude</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ambush" title="Ambush">surprise</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Performance_(aircraft)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Performance (aircraft) (page does not exist)">performance</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Numerical_superiority&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Numerical superiority (page does not exist)">numerical superiority</a>.</p>
<p>Speed - the pilot with the faster of two machines has control over the combat. He has the choice to break off combat and retire. The slower machine can not catch him. The pilot of a slower machine must stay on the defense. He can not run to safety. A fast moving aircraft can perform elaborate maneuvers, giving its pilot many options. A machine flying close to its stall speed can do little beyond wallowing in a more or less straight line. Aircraft engines available in 1914 and 1915 provided just enough thrust to keep machines airborne at 150 km/h (93 mph), and not much more. Level flight was fine, but climbing to a higher altitude took several minutes and cut air speed nearly in half. Diving, on the other hand, could add half again to a plane's top speed. By 1916, engine power and speed increased. By the end of the war, aircraft were operating regularly at speeds over 200 km/h (124 mph). Speed was critical.</p>
<p>Altitude - From the advantage of flying above his opponent, a pilot had more control over how and where the fight takes place. He could dive upon his opponent, gaining a sizable speed advantage for a hit and run attack. Or, if the enemy had too many advantages- numbers for instance- a pilot could fly away with a good head start. On average, WWI aircraft climbed slowly. Altitude was a hard earned 'potential energy' store not to be given away capriciously.</p>
<p>Surprise - getting the first shot before one's opponent is prepared to return fire was the 'safest' and preferred method for attack. Most air victories were achieved in the first pass. Without all-seeing devices like radar, a pilot could approach his foe stealthily, using clouds, haze or even using the enemy aircraft's own wings or tail to conceal his approach. The glare of the sun, especially, provided an effective hiding spot.</p>
<p>Performance- Knowing the strengths, weakness and capabilities of your own aircraft, and that of your foe, was also critical. Who was faster, who could turn tighter, how many were there, etc. He argued against foolish acts of 'heroism.' If he could not 'secure advantages,' he would not attack. One of Boelcke's pupils, <a href="/wiki/Manfred_von_Richthofen" title="Manfred von Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>, learned this rule very well and became the war's top scoring ace.</p>
<p>A documented example of Boelcke 'securing advantages' took place on 17 September 1916. Boelcke and his pilots intercepted a flight of bombers and fighters crossing the lines. He chose not to attack right away, but had his <a href="/wiki/Jasta" title="Jasta">Jasta</a> climb higher above the bombers, keeping themselves between the bombers and the sun. There they circled and waited. When the bomber pilots, observers and fighter escort pilots were preoccupied with the destruction they were causing on the ground, Boelcke signaled for his pilots to attack. Several enemy aircraft went down and Jasta lost no one.</p>
<p><b>2.Always continue with an attack you have begun:</b></p>
<p>Rookie pilots would start a fight, but instinct (fear) would convince them to break it off and run. This inevitably presented the rookie's tail to his opponent's guns, making the rookie an easy victory for his enemy. Boelcke learned that it was far better to stay and continue mixing it up — waiting for his opponent to make mistakes or flee — than to break and run. To turn tail and run was to surrender most, if not all, of the advantages a pilot might have had. As an example, when Manfred von Richthofen met British ace <a href="/wiki/Lanoe_Hawker" title="Lanoe Hawker">Lanoe Hawker</a> in November 1916, each persisted in trying to get on the other's tail. Both stuck to Boelcke's second dictum. When their endless circling had brought them down near the ground behind German lines, Hawker had to choose between landing and capture or fleeing. He chose to flee. Richthofen was then able to get behind him and shoot him down.</p>
<p><b>3.Only fire at close range, and then only when the opponent is properly in your sights:</b></p>
<p>A common rookie's urge was to start blasting away upon sighting his first enemy machine. Shots taken at ranges of 1000 m (3280 ft) stood little chance of hitting their mark. The rattle of machine gun fire would alert the intended target and gave them time to react.</p>
<p>The machine guns available for aircraft during the Great War were not highly accurate at longer ranges. Add to that the difficulty of aiming from a moving, bouncing gun platform at a fast moving target and it is a marvel that anyone ever hit anything. Boelcke preferred to fly to within 100 m (330 ft) or less before firing, to ensure hitting what he aimed at with his opening burst. Once the rattle of his guns was heard, the advantage of surprise was gone, so it was best to make that first shot most effective.</p>
<p>Another aspect of making each shot count was the limited supply of ammunition carried in WWI aircraft — usually only several hundred rounds. This could amount to less than 60 seconds of sustained fire. Reloading in the air varied from dangerous to impossible. Spraying the sky with lead in hopes of hitting something, eventually, was not an option. Shots had to be chosen carefully. Early in the war, when a sense of chivalry still held sway, some men allowed their opponents to depart if they were out of ammunition or had jammed guns. <a href="/wiki/Total_war" title="Total war">Total war</a> did not allow such courtesies to last for long.</p>
<p><b>4.You should always try to keep your eye on your opponent, and never let yourself be deceived by ruses:</b></p>
<p>The first part, 'keeping your eye on your opponent,' sounds obvious enough, but it needed to be stated. In the hustle and bustle of an air fight it was easy to lose sight of your adversary. A restatement of this rule might be: never assume you know where your opponent is or will be. If a pilot 'lost' his foe, the advantage shifted to the foe. A successful pilot did not allow himself to be distracted from his opponent. As far as ruses go, it was not an uncommon practice for a pilot to feign being hit, going into a supposedly uncontrolled spin or dive, in order to exit a fight that was not going well. This practice traded on the chivalry of their opponents. To continue hammering a man who was already going down, was thought unsportsmanlike. Boelcke recognized that too many enemy were being allowed to escape and return to fight another day. War for national survival was not sport. He taught against the accepted notion that once a machine began to spin down, that one could move on. If it were a ruse, the enemy pilot would pull out at the last moment and either escape or return to attack, perhaps now having gained the advantage of surprise. Boelcke wanted his pupils to follow their opponent down. Make sure they were out of the fight or resume the fight if necessary.</p>
<p><b>5.In any type of attack, it is essential to assail your opponent from behind:</b></p>
<p>Firing at a machine flying across one's path required 'leading' the shot -- aiming ahead of a moving target to compensate for its speed. While a few pilots were adept at the mental calculations necessary and good aerial marksmen, most were much less adept. The velocity of a moving gun platform, the speed of bullets plus the speed and direction of a moving target could be a lot to consider in the heat of battle. Furthermore, in deflection firing, the target could cross the stream of fire whose bullets were 50 m (165 ft) or more apart. Such crossing gave less exposure to the bullets.</p>
<p>Head-on attacks or head-to-tail attacks required little or no calculated deflection in aim. Head-on attack, however, exposed one directly to the enemy's guns. Far safer and more effective to have one's target and bullet stream all traveling in more or less the same direction. This required little or no 'leading,' and exposed the target to a greater concentration of fire.</p>
<p>Because of the prevalence of attack from the rear, aircraft design adapted to allow for rear firing guns in two-seaters and larger bombers.</p>
<p><b>6.If your opponent dives on you, do not try to get around his attack, but fly to meet it:</b></p>
<p>This rule is related to dictum #2 above. The instinctive reaction of many rookies was to turn and flee from an approaching attacker -- especially a diving one. This simply presented their tail to the attacker, usually with disastrous results. Boelcke taught that a pilot had to conquer that instinct. Turning to face the attack could force the attacker onto the defensive, or at least keep the situation unsettled, which was far better than presenting your tail. Even though climbing to meet an attack would reduce speed, it was better to try to bring one's own guns to bear than flee.</p>
<p><b>7.When over the enemy's lines, never forget your own line of retreat:</b></p>
<p>If a pilot chose to flee a superior force, or was coming down with damaged machine, it was critical to spend what little time he might have going in the right direction. This rule sounds as though it is stating the obvious, but Boelcke found it necessary to include. More than a few pilots came down behind enemy lines because they got confused and lost their way. In WWI, aerial navigation was done mostly by sight. Taking regular note of landmarks helped a pilot get his bearings quickly, perhaps making the difference between safety and captivity.</p>
<p><b>8.Tip for Squadrons: In principle, it is better to attack in groups of four or six. Avoid two aircraft attacking the same opponent:</b></p>
<p>In the first year or so of WWI, air combat was more of a one-on-one affair. The early aces, like <a href="/wiki/Adolphe_Pegoud" title="Adolphe Pegoud">Pegoud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roland_Garros_(aviator)" title="Roland Garros (aviator)">Garros</a>, Boelcke and <a href="/wiki/Max_Immelmann" title="Max Immelmann">Immelmann</a>, hunted the skies alone. Later in the war the sheer number of machines in the sky increased. Several reconnaissance machines traveled together for mutual protection, further protected by escorting fighters. Boelcke recognized that the days of the lone hunter were over. Many young pilots, however, still came to the front expecting to dash valiantly into battle alone as an errant knight, only to be quickly overwhelmed by multiple enemies. Boelcke tirelessly lectured his pupils on the need for teamwork -- sometimes scolding them for acting too independently. Attacking in a group allowed the leader to concentrate his attention exclusively on his target, while his 'wingmen' protected his tail.</p>
<p>Air battles later in the war could involve dozens of aircraft from each side at the same time. The sky could become a swirling tangle of machines. When 'your' side was at a numerical disadvantage, it was especially important not to double up on one opponent. The concentrated fire was of dubious value, since you were just as likely to get in each other's way as hit the enemy. Doubling up also left an enemy machine somewhere unbothered and free to tail one of your side's machines. Later in the war, teamwork became the primary key to success and survival.</p>

<ul>
<li>For Comparison <a href="/wiki/Edward_Mannock" title="Edward Mannock">Edward Mannock</a>'s rules:</li>
</ul>
<p>Mannock formulated a set of practical rules for air fighting on the Western Front that, like Oswald Boelcke's Dicta, were passed on to new pilots.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pilots must dive to attack with zest, and must hold their fire until they get within one hundred yards (90 m) of their target.</li>
<li>Achieve surprise by approaching from the East. (From the German side of the front.)</li>
<li>Utilise the sun's glare and clouds to achieve surprise.</li>
<li>Pilots must keep physically fit by exercise and the moderate use of stimulants.</li>
<li>Pilots must sight their guns and practise as much as possible as targets are normally fleeting.</li>
<li>Pilots must practise spotting machines in the air and recognising them at long range, and every aeroplane is to be treated as an enemy until it is certain it is not.</li>
<li>Pilots must learn where the enemy's blind spots are.</li>
<li>Scouts must be attacked from above and two-seaters from beneath their tails.</li>
<li>Pilots must practise quick turns, as this manoeuvre is more used than any other in a fight.</li>
<li>Pilot must practise judging distances in the air as these are very deceptive.</li>
<li>Decoys must be guarded against — a single enemy is often a decoy — therefore the air above should be searched before attacking.</li>
<li>If the day is sunny, machines should be turned with as little bank as possible, otherwise the sun glistening on the wings will give away their presence at a long range.</li>
<li>Pilots must keep turning in a dog fight and never fly straight except when firing.</li>
<li>Pilots must never, under any circumstances, dive away from an enemy, as he gives his opponent a non-deflection shot — bullets are faster than aeroplanes.</li>
<li>Pilots must keep their eye on their watches during patrols, and on the direction and strength of the wind.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>For Comparison see <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Malan" title="Adolf Malan">Adolf Malan</a>'s Rules of Air Fighting:</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not an instinctive, gifted pilot Malan was an exceptional shot and a very aggressive air fighter, and above all a superb tactician who instilled the methods and techniques he had honed in 1940 into successive generations of young fighter pilots who followed him.</p>
<p>Malan developed a set of simple rules for fighter pilots, to be disseminated throughout <a href="/wiki/RAF_Fighter_Command" title="RAF Fighter Command">RAF Fighter Command</a>, which eventually could be found tacked to the wall of most airbases:</p>
<p><b>TEN OF MY RULES FOR AIR FIGHTING</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Wait until you see the whites of his eyes. Fire short bursts of one to two seconds only when your sights are definitely "ON".</li>
<li>Whilst shooting think of nothing else, brace the whole of your body: have both hands on the stick: concentrate on your ring sight.</li>
<li>Always keep a sharp lookout. "Keep your finger out".</li>
<li>Height gives you the initiative.</li>
<li>Always turn and face the attack.</li>
<li>Make your decisions promptly. It is better to act quickly even though your tactics are not the best.</li>
<li>Never fly straight and level for more than 30 seconds in the combat area.</li>
<li>When diving to attack always leave a proportion of your formation above to act as a top guard.</li>
<li>INITIATIVE, AGGRESSION, AIR DISCIPLINE, and TEAM WORK are words that MEAN something in Air Fighting.</li>
<li>Go in quickly - Punch hard - Get out!</li>

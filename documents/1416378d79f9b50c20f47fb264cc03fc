			<p>The following are partial <b>lists of changes in <i>Star Wars</i> re-releases</b>. The commercial success of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> has given <a href="/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> the opportunity to alter his original trilogy, which is composed of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back" title="Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back">Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi" title="Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi">Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a></i>. Many changes were motivated by George Lucas's desire to make the original films closer to his vision for them (although he directed only one of the films).</p>
<p>The new versions made heavy use of <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">CGI technology</a> and other new production techniques that emerged in the two decades after the original trilogy was produced. Other changes enhanced the cohesiveness of the films and eliminated <a href="/wiki/Continuity_(fiction)" title="Continuity (fiction)">continuity</a> errors between the <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy" title="Star Wars original trilogy" class="mw-redirect">original trilogy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy" title="Star Wars prequel trilogy" class="mw-redirect">the three</a> <a href="/wiki/Prequel" title="Prequel">prequels</a> (produced in the late 1990s and early 2000s). The changes are controversial, with opponents claiming that these changes detract from the character arc of the films and tend to be more distracting than expedient.</p>
<p>In a <a href="#External_links" title="">September 2004 CNN article</a>, Lucas claimed that the original films were "25 to 30 percent" of what he intended. Despite this statement, the original films were massively popular and regarded as "groundbreaking", and many of his changes have met with lukewarm reception. Along with obvious changes to various scenes, the re-releases improved the visual and audio quality of the films.</p>
<p>Changes to <i>Star Wars</i> films after the theatrical release are not always limited to the original trilogy. In the release of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" title="Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace">The Phantom Menace</a></i> DVD, two deleted portions were either partially or completely restored.</p>
<p>According to <a href="/wiki/Lucasfilm" title="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a>, the 2004 Special Edition is the <a href="/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canonical</a> version of the original trilogy, even though the original, unaltered theatrical editions were first released on DVD on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2006-09-12"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="09-12"><a href="/wiki/September_12" title="September 12">September 12</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/2006" title="2006">2006</a></span>.</p>

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">There will only be one. And it won't be what I would call the "rough cut," it'll be the "final cut." The other one will be some sort of interesting artifact that people will look at and say, "There was an earlier draft of this." The same thing happens with plays and earlier drafts of books. In essence, films never get finished, they get abandoned. At some point, you're dragged off the picture kicking and screaming while somebody says, "Okay, it's done." That isn't really the way it should work. Occasionally, [you can] go back and get your cut of the video out there, which I did on both <i><a href="/wiki/American_Graffiti" title="American Graffiti">American Graffiti</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/THX_1138" title="THX 1138">THX 1138</a></i>; that's the place where it will live forever. So what ends up being important in my mind is what the DVD version is going to look like, because that's what everybody is going to remember. The other versions will disappear. Even the 35 million tapes of <i>Star Wars</i> out there won't last more than 30 or 40 years. A hundred years from now, the only version of the movie that anyone will remember will be the DVD version [of the Special Edition], and you'll be able to project it on a 20' by 40' screen with perfect quality. I think it's the director's prerogative, not the studio's to go back and reinvent a movie.</td>

<p>These are <a href="/wiki/Pan_and_scan" title="Pan and scan">pan and scan</a> versions of the original theatrical releases of the original three films.</p>
<p>None of the original releases of <i>Star Wars</i> on <a href="/wiki/VHS" title="VHS">VHS</a>, <a href="/wiki/Betamax" title="Betamax">Betamax</a>, and RCA's <a href="/wiki/SelectaVision" title="SelectaVision">CED</a> contained the line uttered by C-3PO "The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave." This line was not in the original <a href="/wiki/Dolby_Stereo" title="Dolby Stereo">Dolby Stereo</a> mix, which was the soundtrack used on all early video releases. In 1985 <a href="/wiki/Ben_Burtt" title="Ben Burtt">Ben Burtt</a> re-mixed the soundtrack and the line was heard for the first time on home video.</p>
<p>Due to technical and cost limitations, the <a href="/wiki/SelectaVision" title="SelectaVision">CED</a> editions of <i>Star Wars</i> are presented time-compressed (sped up by 3%) from its original 121-minute length to 118 minutes to fit one double-sided two-hour disc.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/wiki/UK" title="UK" class="mw-redirect">UK</a> and throughout <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Widescreen" title="Widescreen">widescreen</a> VHS versions of the original three films were released in 1991. An <a href="/wiki/Advert" title="Advert" class="mw-redirect">advert</a> before the films explained how widescreen showed more of the picture. They were re-released in 1994 with different artwork and released a third time as THX versions in 1995.</p>
<p>The VHS reissue in 1995, which was the last available release of the Pre–Special Edition trilogy prior to the 2006 DVD release, utilized <a href="/wiki/THX" title="THX">THX</a> digital remastering to enhance the picture and sound quality on all three films.</p>

<p>Due to technical limitations, most pan and scan versions of <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> are presented time-compressed (sped up by 3%) from their respective 121- and 125-minute lengths to fit one double-sided 2-hour disc. <a href="/wiki/Letterbox" title="Letterbox">Letterbox</a> versions of the original theatrical releases of the original three films have also been released.</p>
<p>The initial 1989 North American widescreen release of <i>Star Wars</i> suffered from a shrinking <a href="/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio</a>. The master that was used was the Japanese subtitled <a href="/wiki/Laserdisc" title="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a>, in which the image appeared higher in the screen to allow for <a href="/wiki/Subtitle_(captioning)" title="Subtitle (captioning)">subtitles</a>. For the North American release, it was shifted down, and a black bar was put up to cover the unused parts. However, as the film progresses, the image creeps up on the screen moving underneath the top bar, causing the image to become increasingly wide. By the time the film reaches the Battle of Yavin scenes, the image has widened from 2.35:1 to 2.55:1. This problem was fixed in the 1992 re-issue of the disc. The original shrinking LD has the <a href="/wiki/CBS/Fox_Video" title="CBS/Fox Video">CBS/Fox</a> logo on it, but the fixed edition has the newer "<a href="/wiki/Fox_Video" title="Fox Video" class="mw-redirect">Fox Video</a>" logo on the jacket. The C-3PO line about the tractor beam can be heard on this laserdisc.</p>
<p>In 1993, the <i>Star Wars Trilogy: The Definitive Collection</i> box set was released. This version featured the original trilogy on 9 <a href="/wiki/Constant_Angular_Velocity" title="Constant Angular Velocity" class="mw-redirect">CAV</a> discs, widescreen transfers, THX remastering, audio commentary tracks, assorted bonus features, a copy of the hardcover book <i>George Lucas: The Creative Impulse</i>, and for <i>Star Wars IV: A New Hope</i>, a new surround sound audio mix created from elements of the 70&#160;mm 6 track magnetic, 35&#160;mm Dolby Stereo optical and 35&#160;mm optical mono mixes.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Initial versions of this box set were missing approximately 10 seconds from <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. Fox Video offered a replacement disc, and this mistake was corrected in later pressings.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The final <a href="/wiki/Laserdisc" title="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a> edition of the original trilogy was released in 1995, sourced from the 1993 masters.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

For the re-release, in addition to extensive clean-up and restoration work, Lucas also made a number of changes to the films in order to "finish the film the way it was meant to be" (as Lucas claimed in a September 2004 interview with the <a href="/wiki/Associated_Press" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>).</p>
<p>Many of Lucas's changes for the Special Editions were cosmetic, generally adding special effects which were not originally possible. Other changes, however, are considered to have affected plot or character development. These changes, such as the change referred to by fans as "Han shot first", have proven to be controversial.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In 2004, in addition to an extremely extensive high-definition digital cleanup and restoration job by <a href="/wiki/Lowry_Digital_Images" title="Lowry Digital Images" class="mw-redirect">Lowry Digital Images</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy" title="Star Wars original trilogy" class="mw-redirect">original trilogy</a> films were changed once again for their release on DVD on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="09-21"><a href="/wiki/September_21" title="September 21">September 21</a></span>, 2004. In these new versions of the films, a few changes which had been made for the 1997 Special Editions were removed and fresh changes were made to the films. With this release, Lucasfilm created a new high-definition master of the films, which will be used in future releases as well.</p>
<p>Two of the most notable of these new changes include new footage shot during the filming of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is that of <a href="/wiki/Ian_McDiarmid" title="Ian McDiarmid">Ian McDiarmid</a> portraying Palpatine, which has been inserted into <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, replacing the original performance (voiced by actor <a href="/wiki/Clive_Revill" title="Clive Revill">Clive Revill</a> and portrayed by an uncredited actress wearing a specially made mask, with chimpanzee eyes superimposed over her own) recorded for the film.</li>
<li>The other alteration was to a scene at the end of <i>Episode VI</i>, when the spirits of <a href="/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi" title="Obi-Wan Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Yoda" title="Yoda">Yoda</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a> look upon the Rebels' celebration. <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Shaw_(actor)" title="Sebastian Shaw (actor)">Sebastian Shaw</a>, the original actor who played Anakin in this scene, was replaced by new footage of <a href="/wiki/Hayden_Christensen" title="Hayden Christensen">Hayden Christensen</a>, the actor who played Anakin in Episodes <i>II</i> and <i>III</i>. This act was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette "Return of the Jedi: What has changed?", as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVD releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the vocals of <a href="/wiki/Boba_Fett" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a> were relatively minor to begin with, they were altered for the sake of consistency and continuity. The 2004 edition no longer has the original voice of <a href="/wiki/Jason_Wingreen" title="Jason Wingreen">Jason Wingreen</a> but rather the voice of <a href="/wiki/Temuera_Morrison" title="Temuera Morrison">Temuera Morrison</a>, as the prequel films fleshed out Boba as a clone of <a href="/wiki/Jango_Fett" title="Jango Fett">Jango Fett</a>, portrayed by Morrison with his distinctive New Zealand accent.</p>
<p>In the DVD releases, the lightsaber blades were upgraded to look more like they do in the prequel trilogy, but they are still not quite near their quality. This is most evident in <i>A New Hope</i>, during Luke's training on the Falcon and Obi-Wan's fight with Vader.</p>

<p>In 2005, the 2004 Special Editions were again released on DVD; however, this time they were repackaged and sold as a three-disc set that did not include the bonus materials disc. This was done to provide a more affordable trilogy set. Labeled only as the "<i>Star Wars Trilogy: Episode IV, V, VI</i>" this set was also billed as a "Limited Edition". As of 2007, copies could still be found on many store shelves.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_changes_in_Star_Wars_re-releases&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: 2006 DVD release">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">2006 DVD release</span></h3>
<p>On <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2006-09-12"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="09-12"><a href="/wiki/September_12" title="September 12">September 12</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/2006" title="2006">2006</a></span>, the original trilogy was re-released on DVD for a limited time (until <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2006-12-31"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="12-31"><a href="/wiki/December_31" title="December 31">December 31</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/2006" title="2006">2006</a></span>), though, as of April 2009, copies can still be found in stores. Each film (Episodes <i>IV</i>, <i>V</i>, and <i>VI</i>) is packaged as a two-disc set with the first disc presenting the 2004 Special Edition with remastered THX sound and video and the second disc containing the "original, unaltered theatrical release" of each film as bonus material.</p>
<p>These original editions are said to be presented as they were first shown theatrically. For example, <i>Star Wars</i> has the 1977 <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_opening_crawl" title="Star Wars opening crawl">opening crawl</a> (before "Episode IV: A New Hope" was added and other adjustments made for the <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1981-04-10"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="04-10"><a href="/wiki/April_10" title="April 10">April 10</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a></span> re-issue). However, the video transfer is derived not from original masters, but from the 1993 Laserdisc transfer (aside from the original <i>Episode IV</i> opening scroll taken from a best available original 1977 print), meaning that the film's 2.35:1 Panavision format is <a href="/wiki/Letterboxed" title="Letterboxed" class="mw-redirect">letterboxed</a> into a non-<a href="/wiki/Anamorphic" title="Anamorphic" class="mw-redirect">anamorphic</a> 4:3 video frame (appearing that way even on widescreen televisions.)<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Also, instead of using the original sound mixes from the initial theatrical releases, the 'bonus' DVD presentations use the 1993 laserdisc remixes (presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo). However, the Spanish and French audio tracks on the <i>Star Wars</i> DVD appear to be based on the original theatrical mono sound mix for the film (originally the most widely-heard original theatrical sound mix in 1977, now a rarity), <i>not</i> the Definitive Collection version. Certain sound effects from the 1993 mix are missing (such as all of the "exploding glass" sounds when Luke and Han blast the various cameras and such in the Death Star's detention center), and certain sounds have been added (such as metallic clicks when <a href="/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chewbacca" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> press buttons on the <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a>'s holographic chessboard). <a href="/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> also says "Blast it, <i><a href="/wiki/Wedge_Antilles" title="Wedge Antilles">Wedge</a></i>, where are you?" during the final battle on the alternate language tracks, something he only said in the theatrical mono mix. In all other versions of the film, he says, "Blast it, <i><a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_characters#D" title="List of Star Wars characters">Biggs</a></i>, where are you?"</p>
<p>The French and Spanish audio tracks for <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> 2006 DVD also feature a different sound mix (apparently based on the initial 70&#160;mm mix from 1980) than the 1993 Definitive Collection mix. This alternate mix features additional sounds that were not heard on the 35&#160;mm and subsequent home video versions, but which were later reincorporated into the 1997 and 2004 mixes. Such sounds include additional <a href="/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a> beeps when Yoda rummages through Luke's supplies, which are missing from prior mixes, and additional <a href="/wiki/TIE_fighter" title="TIE fighter">TIE fighter</a> engine sounds in the establishing shot of <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Star_Destroyer" title="Star Destroyer">Star Destroyer</a> (after <a href="/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> beheads the illusory Vader on <a href="/wiki/Dagobah" title="Dagobah">Dagobah</a>), which are missing from the prior 35&#160;mm/home video sound mixes.</p>
<p>This set was dubbed a "Limited Edition", with the original "unaltered" movies being included as a second "bonus disc", and the "default" movie was the 2004 edition. As of today, copies can still be found on most store shelves. The only extras included on the "Bonus Disc" were an Xbox demo of <i><a href="/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars_II:_The_Original_Trilogy" title="Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy">Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy</a></i> and a trailer for the game. Each movie disc had identical bonus content.</p>

<ul>
<li>The line "Episode IV: A NEW HOPE" was added to the opening crawl from 1981 onward. The new opening crawl also capitalized the word 'Rebel' in 'rebel spies', which was not capitalized in the original 1977 opening crawl.</li>
<li>The film was initially released in <a href="/wiki/70mm" title="70mm" class="mw-redirect">70mm</a> 6-track audio; further work on the soundtrack continued for the wider 35&#160;mm release with a 2-track <a href="/wiki/Dolby_Stereo" title="Dolby Stereo">Dolby Stereo</a> (matrixed 4 channel) optical soundtrack. A mono mix was produced later for exhibition in cinemas with no Dolby Stereo support, which contains some changes from the stereo version. Most video releases until the Special Edition were based on the stereo mix.</li>
<li>Alternate takes of C-3PO's dialogue are used in the mono sound version.</li>
<li>The line "close the blast doors!" was added to the mono release.</li>
<li>C-3PO's tractor beam line was added to the mono version (this line was also included in the 1997 special edition and 2004 DVD versions).</li>
<li>The line "Blast it, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_characters#D" title="List of Star Wars characters">Biggs</a>, where are you?" from the original stereo sound version was changed to "Blast it, <a href="/wiki/Wedge_Antilles" title="Wedge Antilles">Wedge</a>, where are you?" for the mono sound releases.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_characters#L" title="List of Star Wars characters">Beru Lars</a> is voiced by a different actress in the mono version.</li>
<li>The 1985 VHS release features a digitally remastered sound mix supervised by <a href="/wiki/Ben_Burtt" title="Ben Burtt">Ben Burtt</a>, which contains C-3PO's tractor beam line.

<p>The 70&#160;mm version included a large number of changes from the 35&#160;mm version that was more widely seen.</p>
<ul>
<li>After the Probe droid lands and moves left, there is an optical <a href="/wiki/Wipe_(transition)" title="Wipe (transition)">wipe</a> to the overhead shot of <a href="/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke</a> on his Tauntaun.</li>
<li>After Luke wanders through the snow and falls face down, there is an optical wipe to Han instead of a straight cut.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Bacta_tank" title="Bacta tank" class="mw-redirect">bacta tank</a> scene starts on a close-up of Two-One-Bee and pans right to a close-up of Luke in the tank. It then cuts to FX-7 extending its arm to the tank. There is no cut to Leia, Han and Threepio observing.</li>
<li>In the snow battle scene, when Luke drops into the snow after throwing a charge into the Imperial walker, the AT-ST in the background has no atmospheric depth. It looks too close and small.</li>
<li>In the Emperor scene, the hologram of the Emperor is already present in the first shot—it does not "tune in" gradually.</li>
<li>The Imperial Fleet establishing shot, after the evil tree scene, has a different TIE fighter sound effect.</li>
<li>When Luke falls from Cloud City into the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, the <i>Falcon'</i>s radar dish is not added to the shot.</li>
<li>The telepathy between Luke and Vader during the "Hyperspace" cue has straight cuts instead of quick dissolves.</li>
<li>On Hoth, right after C-3PO tells R2 to "Switch off", R2 gives out a little "blurp".</li>
<li>When Luke finally collapses in the snow, he lets out a grunt as he lands on his face.</li>
<li>Han says "until I can get the shelter up" instead of "until I can get the shelter built."</li>
<li>Luke says an additional "Ben... Dagobah..." just before Han says, "and I thought they smelled bad on the outside."</li>
<li>When C-3PO tells Luke "It's so good to see you fully functional again", Luke replies, "Thanks, 3PO."</li>
<li>The line "Headquarters personnel report to Command Center" is repeated three times instead of two.</li>
<li>The lines "The first transport is away!" and later "Imperial troops have entered the base!..." over the Echo Base PA system are no longer voiced by Mark Hamill.</li>
<li>When R2 is being loaded into Luke's X-Wing, C-3PO says the word "and" before saying "do take good care of yourself."</li>
<li>Han's line "Transport, this is Solo. Better take off, I can't get to you. I'll get her out on the Falcon" is followed by, "Come on!"</li>
<li>In the asteroid field, after C-3PO says, "Oh, this is suicide", he says, "There's nowhere to go."</li>
<li>In the scene where R2-D2 is rejected by the bog beast, Luke says "You're lucky you don't taste very good", instead of "You were lucky to get out of there."</li>
<li>Yoda makes a frightened "AAHHH" sound just before Luke says, "Like we're being watched", and points his blaster at him.</li>
<li>Yoda says the word "Run" before "Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the force." The following lines "But beware the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side of the force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight" are also much louder and clearer.</li>
<li>In Cloud City, after C-3PO says "That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if it..." he says "Hello?" only once instead of twice.</li>
<li>Before C-3PO gets shot, a different voice says "Who are you?"</li>
<li>While C-3PO is on Chewie's back when they enter the carbon freezing chamber, the line "Now remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish" is louder and heard more clearly.</li>
<li>During the duel, when Luke knocks Vader off the platform, Vader lets out an "ooooh!" instead of an "aaargh!"</li>
<li>Lando's line at the end, "Luke, we're ready for takeoff", is a different take.</li>
<li>In the final scene, there is no tracked music from "Yoda and the Force".</li>

<li>The opening battle sequence was cleaned up.</li>
<li>New scenes on <a href="/wiki/Hoth" title="Hoth">Hoth</a> with a redesigned <a href="/wiki/Wampa" title="Wampa">wampa</a> ice creature, including showing the full-body wampa screeching in agony following the loss of its limb. Two close-up shots of the original wampa mask are still noticeable.</li>
<li>When <a href="/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> heads to the exit of the wampa's cave, his lightsaber's deactivation sound is heard, even though the blade does not retract.</li>
<li>The blaster bolts of the TIE fighters have been made more green.</li>
<li>A shot of Darth Vader's Star Destroyer has additional TIE fighters; one appears to follow a non-linear path.</li>
<li>The TIE fighter that collides with an asteroid and blows up has additional sparking added to it.</li>
<li>The <i>Millennium Falcon</i> casts a digitally created shadow on the asteroid. Though the surface seems to grow closer, the shadow remains the same size.</li>
<li>The scene where the <i><a href="/wiki/Slave_I" title="Slave I">Slave I</a></i> follows the <i>Falcon</i> out of the Star Destroyer's floating garbage includes a newly created CG shot of it pursuing the <i>Falcon</i>.</li>
<li>At the entrance shot of Cloud City, the Cloud Car was replaced by a Tibanna refinery. (The Tibanna refinery is almost <a href="/wiki/Pan_and_scan" title="Pan and scan">panned and scanned</a> out of the full screen DVD version. The right side of the refinery can be seen briefly in the full screen DVD version if <a href="/wiki/Overscan" title="Overscan">played on a PC</a>.)</li>
<li>New and additional shots of <a href="/wiki/Cloud_City" title="Cloud City" class="mw-redirect">Cloud City</a>.</li>
<li>Several wall panels have been digitally replaced with windows to show more of Cloud City.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke</a>'s line, "You're lucky you don't taste very good", after R2-D2 is spit out by a <a href="/wiki/Dagobah" title="Dagobah">Dagobah</a> swamp slug, is changed back to the original "You were lucky to get out of there."</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Lando_Calrissian" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a> says "Attention" twice (instead of once) when he speaks on the Cloud City PA.</li>
<li>Shots of people listening to <a href="/wiki/Lando_Calrissian" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando</a> on the PA ordering the evacuation of the city are added.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke</a> screams as he jumps off the platform in <a href="/wiki/Cloud_City" title="Cloud City" class="mw-redirect">Cloud City</a> (the scream is actually lifted from the <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a>'s death scream from <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi" title="Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi">Return of the Jedi</a></i>)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>'s terse-but-forceful line, "Bring my shuttle", is changed to the more benignly-toned "Alert my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival", a line originally recorded for <i>A New Hope</i>; a wide-angle CGI visual is added, showing Vader boarding his shuttle. This short added scene is spliced directly into the action surrounding Leia, Lando, and Chewie's attempt to rescue Luke as he dangles from a weather vane below Cloud City. The music track that has become known as "Rescue from Cloud City / Hyperspace" — a track that, in the film's original version, begins from the moment Vader cuts off Luke's hand and continues until Vader storms off of the bridge of the <i>Executor</i> after the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> escapes into hyperspace — is also now spliced, in a manner corresponding to the insertion of the short added scene. Specifically, for approximately 5 to 10 seconds, music originally played at the moment Vader informs Luke of his parentage (itself an earlier part of the "Rescue from Cloud City / Hyperspace" track) is incongruously inserted.</li>
<li>A new shot of Darth Vader's shuttle heading toward his star destroyer.</li>
<li>A digital hatch has been added to replace the white light that appears when Lando opens the outer hatch to rescue Luke.</li>
<li>A new scene with <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> landing in the docking bay of his <a href="/wiki/Star_Destroyer" title="Star Destroyer">Star Destroyer</a> is included, taken from an <a href="/wiki/Outtake" title="Outtake">outtake</a> from <i>Return of the Jedi</i> — like the footage of Vader boarding his shuttle, this short scene is similarly spliced directly into the action surrounding the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>'s escape from Bespin, and the music accompanying the added footage (both a few short seconds of music taken from the very beginning of "Rescue from Cloud City / Hyperspace" and then a few seconds of the same music that was used during the shuttle-boarding footage insertion) likewise cuts incongruously into "Rescue from Cloud City / Hyperspace".</li>
<li>"The Imperial March" is partially repeated in the ending credits music to make room for the Special Edition release credits.</li>

In the 2004 DVD, Han Solo shoots at approximately the same time, but is still slightly slower by about 2 frames.</div>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Before R2-D2 and C-3PO enter the escape pod near the beginning of the movie, a beeping sound is added when R2 pushes the switches to open the door to the escape pod.</li>
<li>When the Jawa Sandcrawler stops outside the Lars Homestead, C-3PO says "We've stopped" before telling R2-D2 to wake up.</li>
<li>The long shot of Luke's Landspeeder in the canyon (with the two Tusken Raiders taking aim) has been improved. Now, instead of being merely a moving white 'blob', the landspeeder is actually seen in minute detail.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi" title="Obi-Wan Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>'s scream to scare off the Sand People has been changed to a higher-pitched wail. The old version of Obi-Wan's scream in the original and 1997 versions sounded similar to a dewback. The new version of Obi-Wan's scream in the 2004 version sounds similar to a <a href="/wiki/Krayt_dragon" title="Krayt dragon" class="mw-redirect">krayt dragon</a>.</li>
<li>More debris has been digitally added to the scene at the destroyed <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_races_(F-J)#Jawa" title="List of Star Wars races (F-J)" class="mw-redirect">Jawa</a> <a href="/wiki/Sandcrawler" title="Sandcrawler" class="mw-redirect">sandcrawler</a>.</li>
<li>A brief shot of Luke's landspeeder as it enters <a href="/wiki/Mos_Eisley" title="Mos Eisley">Mos Eisley</a> carrying Luke, Ben Kenobi, and the <a href="/wiki/Droid" title="Droid">droids</a> has been redone. The pink tint is removed from the Mos Eisley entrance scene.</li>
<li>The 'Han vs Greedo' scene is redone again; this time Greedo and Han shoot at almost the exact same moment, but Greedo is still fractionally ahead. Han also dodges Greedo's shot more convincingly. Additionally, Han's original line of, "Yes, I'll bet you have" has been restored (the 1997 Special Edition removed the word 'yes').</li>
<li>An improved <a href="/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">CGI</a> version of <a href="/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt" title="Jabba the Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a> (based on his appearance in <i>The Phantom Menace</i>) now confronts <a href="/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a> in the scene added to the 1997 re-release. Also, when Han steps on Jabba's body to get to the Falcon, Jabba winds up as if to punch him; in the 1997 Special Edition, he yelped in pain.</li>
<li>When the two stormtroopers exit the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, one of them now says "There's no one here."</li>
<li>When the docking bay controller tries to contact TK-421, slightly audible static can be heard over the communicator.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Matte_painting" title="Matte painting">Matte painting</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Detention_(Imprisonment)" title="Detention (Imprisonment)" class="mw-redirect">detention</a> block has been extended, making the corridor seem longer. The painting's perspective has been edited to make it appear more realistic.</li>
<li>The writing on the Death Star tractor beam control panel originally read 'POWER - TRACTOR BEAM 12 (SEC. N6)' and 'INOPERATIVE'. It has been changed from the <a href="/wiki/Latin_alphabet" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> to the standard Star Wars (<a href="/wiki/Aurebesh" title="Aurebesh" class="mw-redirect">Aurebesh</a>) alphabet. The word 'INOPERATIVE' is panned and scanned out of the full screen DVD version.</li>
<li>An audible bump has been added to the infamous gaffe where a screen-right stormtrooper bumps his head on the door-frame when the stormtrooper squadron breaks into the control room. This mistake was hinted at in <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_II:_Attack_of_the_Clones" title="Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones">Episode II</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Jango_Fett" title="Jango Fett">Jango Fett</a> - escaping from Obi-Wan on Kamino - bangs his helmet on the closing door of the <i><a href="/wiki/Slave_I" title="Slave I">Slave I</a></i>.</li>
<li>Luke and Leia's echo when they are trapped in the Death Star chasm is now more convincing.</li>
<li>Despite the revised lightsaber blades, Luke's still appears out of thin air when activated instead of extending out of the hilt and in his training on the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, the lightsaber blade is pale green instead of blue in one shot and it later appears to be plain white, as in previous versions.</li>
<li>During the lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan and Vader, Obi-Wan's lightsaber blade does not look like it is flickering out towards the end of the fight, like it does in previous versions, though it does show a noticeable shimmer of blue light.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a>' score has been flipped in the left and right rear channels and has been quieted or eliminated from some portions of the Battle of Yavin sequence.</li>
<li>The "He's on your tail!" line that was added for the 1997 Special Edition has been removed.</li>
<li>The code cylinders on Grand Moff Tarkin's uniform no longer move up and down between shots.</li>
<li>The shot of the Y-Wings descending to make the first attack run has been fixed. Originally, the two lead Y-Wings disappear when their leading edges touch the bottom of the screen, but the third one smoothly moves out of frame like it should. Now all three move smoothly out of frame.</li>
<li>The colors depicting the destruction of the planet Alderaan and the Death Star have been changed.</li>
<li>When the X-Wings are seen lifting off from the Rebel base before the Death Star battle, the red planet of Yavin is now visible in the upper right of the shot.</li>

<ul>
<li>In a scene where <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> speaks to the Emperor via <a href="/wiki/Hologram" title="Hologram" class="mw-redirect">hologram</a>, the Emperor is now portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Ian_McDiarmid" title="Ian McDiarmid">Ian McDiarmid</a> (in the original film and the Special Edition, the Emperor was portrayed by an uncredited actress wearing a specially made mask with chimpanzee eyes superimposed over her own, with the voice dubbed in by <a href="/wiki/Clive_Revill" title="Clive Revill">Clive Revill</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>) A few lines of new dialogue have been added to this scene as well, in which Palpatine informs Vader that their new enemy is the 'offspring' of <a href="/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker" title="Anakin Skywalker">Anakin Skywalker</a>. McDiarmid actually filmed this scene during <a href="/wiki/Principal_photography" title="Principal photography">principal photography</a> of <a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_III:_Revenge_of_the_Sith" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith">Episode III</a>.</li>
<li>The four lines spoken by <a href="/wiki/Boba_Fett" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a> are now in the voice of <a href="/wiki/Temuera_Morrison" title="Temuera Morrison">Temuera Morrison</a>, the actor who played <a href="/wiki/Jango_Fett" title="Jango Fett">Jango Fett</a> in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>. The voice was originally provided by <a href="/wiki/Jason_Wingreen" title="Jason Wingreen">Jason Wingreen</a>.</li>
<li>Enhancements were made to the shots featuring <a href="/wiki/Cloud_City" title="Cloud City" class="mw-redirect">Cloud City</a>, with additional shots of the following day's landing at the city.</li>
<li>The pink tint is removed from the entrance scene of Cloud City, where the Cloud Car is replaced by the Tibanna refinery for the 1997 version.</li>
<li>In both the original and 1997 versions, during the scene in which Han is lowered into the carbon-freezing chamber, what was thought to be a wardrobe blooper has him wearing his blue vest during one shot. This was eventually discovered to be the result of coincidental shadowing and not a wardrobe blooper, since Han wears a jacket throughout the film, not a vest. In this release, the dark lighting has been digitally erased.</li>
<li>When Luke confronts Vader in the carbon-freezing chamber and ignites his lightsaber, the sound from the original release is overlapped in this scene by the sound produced by Luke's new lightsaber in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.</li>
<li>During the film's lightsaber duel, when Vader jumps off the staircase, his lightsaber blade looks more orange than red, due to miscoloration from the film's restoration team.</li>
<li>The tracked scream of <a href="/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> introduced in the 1997 re-release, which is heard during Luke's voluntary fall from the Cloud City platform after his duel with Vader, was removed. The track was actually the Emperor's death scream from <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.</li>
<li>In the original and 1997 versions, when Darth Vader asks if the <i>Falcon'</i>s hyperdrive is deactivated, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_characters#P" title="List of Star Wars characters">Admiral Piett</a>'s rank plaque and code cylinders are on the wrong side of his uniform (the plaque is supposed to be on the left side of his tunic, but it was on his right side).

<ul>
<li>The matte lines on the rancor have been further altered and the effect is now more realistic.</li>
<li>The dialogue spoken by Jabba the Hutt in the scene where he is discussing the price for Chewbacca that had the subtitles added in the 1997 Special Edition has the subtitles removed, making C-3PO's verbal translations in the scene relevant again.</li>
<li>In Anakin Skywalker's final scene, when he is not wearing his helmet, the eyebrows of actor <a href="/wiki/Sebastian_Shaw_(actor)" title="Sebastian Shaw (actor)">Sebastian Shaw</a> have been digitally removed, indicating what happened to Anakin's eyebrows when he got burned on <a href="/wiki/Mustafar" title="Mustafar">Mustafar</a> in <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. His eyes have also been changed to blue and minor cosmetic alterations have been made to his face to more closely resemble the Anakin portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Hayden_Christensen" title="Hayden Christensen">Hayden Christensen</a> in the prequel trilogy.</li>
<li>During the film's lightsaber duel, Vader's lightsaber blade at times looks more pink than red, once again due to miscoloration from the film's restoration team.</li>
<li>When Anakin, Yoda and Obi-Wan appear together in spirit form at the end of the movie, Sebastian Shaw is replaced by Hayden Christensen, showing a young Anakin with an old Yoda and Obi-Wan.</li>
<li>Another scene of celebration, this one on <a href="/wiki/Naboo" title="Naboo">Naboo</a>, is shown after the Empire is defeated. A <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_races_(F-J)#Gungan" title="List of Star Wars races (F-J)" class="mw-redirect">Gungan</a>, whom many fans assumed to be <a href="/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks" title="Jar Jar Binks">Jar Jar Binks</a>, can be heard saying "Weesa free!" Nevertheless, Jar Jar is not listed in the <i>Star Wars</i> databank as appearing in Episode VI. The rumor of Jar Jar appearing in the film was officially debunked in an episode of <a href="http://www.theforce.net/Podcast/" class="external text" title="http://www.theforce.net/Podcast/" rel="nofollow">The Force-Cast</a> in which it was revealed that the unnamed Gungan was voiced by assistant sound designer <a href="/wiki/Matthew_Wood" title="Matthew Wood">Matthew Wood</a>.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Coruscant" title="Coruscant">Coruscant</a> celebration scene, the Galactic Senate and Jedi Temple have been added to the background. This indicates that the Jedi Temple was not destroyed during the <a href="/wiki/Great_Jedi_Purge" title="Great Jedi Purge">Great Jedi Purge</a>, thus carrying continuity with media released since Episode III, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Unleashed" title="Star Wars: The Force Unleashed">Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</a></i>, which depicts a post-purge Jedi Temple.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in each of the three films, the ending credits have remained unchanged from the Special Edition releases in 1997. Thus, they do not reflect such changes as Ian McDiarmid's Emperor in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> or Hayden Christensen's Anakin in <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. The exception is that the format of the ending credits was changed to that of the prequel trilogy. In the case of pan-and-scan versions of the re-releases, the 2004 DVD releases were pan-and-scanned differently from the 1997 theatrical releases.</p>

<p>In addition to official authorized releases, a black market exists for other versions. These include versions of the film that are no longer available, or versions of the original films in different file formats. "Theatre Rips" are the only source for comparing an actual original theater release of films to changes in recent releases (aside from personal memory). The majority of these are sourced from older releases of the "original" films, such as the pre-1997 VHS/Laserdisc releases.</p>
<p>Bootleg versions also include <a href="/wiki/Fan_edit" title="Fan edit">fan modified/edited</a> versions. One of the most notorious of these was <i><a href="/wiki/The_Phantom_Edit" title="The Phantom Edit">The Phantom Edit</a></i>, a version of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_The_Phantom_Menace" title="Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace">The Phantom Menace</a></i> with certain elements removed, such as scenes of <a href="/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks" title="Jar Jar Binks">Jar Jar Binks</a> that the editor deemed unnecessary. Bootleg versions of the infamous 1970s TV special <i><a href="/wiki/The_Star_Wars_Holiday_Special" title="The Star Wars Holiday Special">The Star Wars Holiday Special</a></i> remain the only source for consumers seeking it, as Lucasfilm has yet to release the special on any format.</p>

<p>This is a partial list of scenes that were not in a <i>film</i> version of the original trilogy or prequels. There are also changes made to deleted scenes as well in some cases. These are included in some home video versions, such as a specific DVD version. Some scenes deleted from the Original Editions of the original trilogy were modified and added back for later versions. For example, a scene where Han Solo talks to a human Jabba the Hutt was not included in the original theater, laser disc, or home video versions of <i>Star Wars</i> (Later renamed <i>Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope</i>), but was modified with CGI (Jabba the Hutt was replaced with a CGI version in the style of the Return of The Jedi Jabba.) and included in the 1997 Special Edition.</p>

<li>While Luke is working on a machine at the Lars homestead, he uses a set of binoculars to look up into the sky. Seeing two starships exchanging laser fire in space, he decides to go to tell his friends at Tosche Station. When he runs to his landspeeder, one of the moisture parolling droids malfunctions. Luke just rolls his eyes and continues to make his way to Anchorhead.</li>
<li>Luke visits his friends at Anchorhead. He tells his friends that he saw a space battle (between the <i>Devastator</i> and the blockade runner <i>Tantive IV</i>) with a set of binoculars; however, the battle is already over and his friends do not believe him. Camie snatches Luke's binoculars and looks up to the stars with them but misses the battle. His friends all head back into the station, leaving Luke outside looking up at the sky.</li>
<li>Biggs tells Luke he wants to defect to the Rebels. This and the preceding two scenes listed above can be viewed on the <a href="/wiki/CD-ROM" title="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars:_Behind_the_Magic" title="Star Wars: Behind the Magic">Star Wars: Behind the Magic</a></i>.</li>
<li>Han and a mysterious woman are seen carousing and kissing in the Cantina before the meeting with Obi Wan and Luke. The intent was to give Han a ladies-man aura.</li>

<li>Grand Moff Tarkin, General Tagge, and General Motti view a <a href="/wiki/Schematic" title="Schematic">schematic</a> of the Death Star and discuss the threat the Rebel incursion aboard holds (the scene features one of the few wire-frame CGI effects created for the film).</li>
<li>After Tarkin destroys <a href="/wiki/Alderaan" title="Alderaan">Alderaan</a>, Princess Leia says: "And you call yourselves humans." (A similar line was included in the NPR radio play: "If there was any shred of humanity in you or these twisted creatures of yours, it's dead now.")</li>

<li>A number of Wampas infiltrate the Rebel base and kill at least one tauntaun. An image exists of a medical droid inspecting a tauntaun carcass. The Wampa attack is mentioned and shown in the Marvel Comics adaptation of the movie.</li>
<li>While travelling through Echo Base's corridors, R2-D2 is attacked by a Wampa. He is rescued and the wampa is killed by Rebel troops.</li>
<li>General Veers is killed when a snowspeeder piloted by Derek "Hobbie" Klivian crashes into his AT-AT Walker cockpit. In Empire where Luke uses a grenade to destroy one of the AT-AT Walkers in the final film by throwing the grenade into its rear, its cockpit actually explodes rather than its rear.</li>
<li>While fleeing Imperial troops, Han suggests they take a shortcut through a room that has a sign on it. Leia tells him "that's where they keep those creatures" (the wampas, which have been confined to the room). They run off and C-3PO tears off the warning sign, hoping the troops will mistake it for another room. (Though never seen in any version of the film, shots of this scene were used in Television ads and trailers for the movie, also the door itself is visible in the movie.) Two Star Wars video games reference this room: <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars:_Shadows_of_the_Empire" title="Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire">Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire</a></i>, and the <i>Star Wars: Trilogy</i> arcade game.</li>
<li>Originally Luke's training on Dagobah was to include a montage sequences showing Luke's training and pace under master Yoda watchful eye, from an extended run across the swamps to various force ability exercises and using his Lightsaber against four seekers orbs (hovering Lightsaber training globes from Episode 4). Black and white pictures exist of Luke training with Yoda on his back while practicing with his Lightsaber (Mark Hamil's prop Lightsaber hilt and rod can be seen in this behind the scenes photo). A page outlining the montage sequences was seen in the Marvel comic book adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back.</li>
<li>In the carbon-freezing sequence, C-3PO's complete line would have been "I'm not ready to die <i>on the back of a demented wookiee!</i>" (the italicized words were deleted from all versions of the film, but were heard in their entirety on the <i>Story of The Empire Strikes Back</i> LP).</li>

<li>Darth Vader lands in the Death Star docking bay with Luke, taking him to the Emperor. This scene was reused in <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> as Vader returns to the <i>Executor</i>. Although Luke cannot be seen, Moff Jerjerrod can be seen mouthing his lines from <i>Return of the Jedi</i>.</li>
<li>When Luke is hiding from Vader in the Throne Room, Luke offers Vader a chance to come and speak with him. Vader rejects the offer saying that he would not give him that kind of advantage. Luke throws his lightsaber to Vader and, after this, Vader realizes that he is protecting Leia from Vader. After Vader discovers his feeling, Luke uses the Force to take the lightsaber from Vader. Evidence of this still exists in the final scene. As Vader talks to Luke, he can be seen holding Luke's lightsaber.</li>

John Scopes in 1925</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) offered to defend anyone accused of teaching the theory of evolution in defiance of the <a href="/wiki/Butler_Act" title="Butler Act">Butler Act</a>. <a href="/wiki/George_Rappleyea" title="George Rappleyea">George Rappleyea</a>, who managed several local mines, convinced a group of businessmen in <a href="/wiki/Dayton,_Tennessee" title="Dayton, Tennessee">Dayton, Tennessee</a>, (a town of 1,756), that the controversy of such a trial would give Dayton much needed publicity. With their agreement, he called in his friend, 24-year-old <a href="/wiki/John_T._Scopes" title="John T. Scopes">John T. Scopes</a>, who was Clark County High School's football coach and had substituted for Principal Ferguson in a science class. Rappleyea asked Scopes to teach the theory of evolution.<sup id="cite_ref-Linder_Introduction_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Linder_Introduction-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Rappleyea pointed out that while the Butler Act prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution, the state required teachers to use a textbook—George Hunter's <i><a href="/wiki/Civic_Biology" title="Civic Biology">Civic Biology</a></i> (1914)—which explicitly described and endorsed the theory of evolution, and that teachers were therefore effectively required to break the law.<sup id="cite_ref-Linder_Introduction_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Linder_Introduction-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Scopes mentioned that while he couldn't remember if he actually taught evolution in class, he did however go through the evolution chart and chapter with the class. Scopes added to the group "If you can prove that I've taught evolution and that I can qualify as a defendant, then I'll be willing to stand trial." <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Scopes became an increasingly willing participant, even incriminating himself and urging students to testify against him.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> He was indicted on May 24, after three students testified against him at the grand jury, at Scopes' behest.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> According to <a href="/wiki/Edward_J._Larson" title="Edward J. Larson" class="mw-redirect">Edward J. Larson</a>, Judge John T. Raulston accelerated the convening of the grand jury and "...all but instructed the grand jury to indict Scopes, despite the meager evidence against him and the widely reported stories questioning whether the willing defendant had ever taught evolution in the classroom."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Scopes was charged with having taught from the chapter on evolution to an April 7, 1925, high school class in violation of the Butler Act (and nominally arrested, though never detained). His bail of $500 was paid by Paul Patterson, owner of the <i><a href="/wiki/Baltimore_Sun" title="Baltimore Sun" class="mw-redirect">Baltimore Sun</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The original <a href="/wiki/Prosecutor" title="Prosecutor">prosecutors</a> were Scopes' friends, Herbert E. and <a href="/wiki/Sue_K._Hicks" title="Sue K. Hicks">Sue K. Hicks</a>, two brothers who were local attorneys, but the prosecution would be ultimately led by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Stewart" title="Tom Stewart">Tom Stewart</a>, a graduate of <a href="/wiki/Cumberland_School_of_Law" title="Cumberland School of Law">Cumberland School of Law</a>, who later became a U.S. Senator.</p>
<p>Hoping to attract major press coverage, George Rappleyea went so far as to write to the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> novelist <a href="/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a> asking him to join the defense team. Wells replied that he had no legal training in Britain, let alone in America, and declined the offer. However, John J. Neal, a law school professor from <a href="/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee" title="Knoxville, Tennessee">Knoxville</a>, announced that he would act as Scopes' attorney—whether Scopes liked it or not—and became the nominal head of the defense team.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Baptist" title="Baptist">Baptist</a> pastor <a href="/wiki/William_Bell_Riley" title="William Bell Riley">William Bell Riley</a>, the founder and president of the <a href="/wiki/World_Christian_Fundamentals_Association" title="World Christian Fundamentals Association">World Christian Fundamentals Association</a>, was instrumental in calling lawyer and three-time <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_the_United_States" title="Democratic Party of the United States" class="mw-redirect">Democratic</a> <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">presidential</a> candidate and lifelong <a href="/wiki/Presbyterianism" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> <a href="/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan" title="William Jennings Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> to act as that organization's counsel. Bryan had originally been invited by Sue Hicks to become an associate of the prosecution and Bryan had readily accepted, despite the fact he had not tried a case in thirty-six years. As Scopes pointed out: "After [Bryan] was accepted by the state as a special prosecutor in the case, there was never any hope of containing the controversy within the bounds of constitutionality."<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In response, <a href="/wiki/Clarence_Darrow" title="Clarence Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Agnosticism" title="Agnosticism">agnostic</a>, volunteered his services to the defense. After many changes back and forth, the defense team consisted of Darrow, ACLU attorney <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Garfield_Hays" title="Arthur Garfield Hays">Arthur Garfield Hays</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Field_Malone" title="Dudley Field Malone">Dudley Field Malone</a>, an international divorce lawyer who had worked at the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State" title="United States Department of State">State Department</a> while Bryan was <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State" title="United States Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a>.</p>
<p>The prosecution team was led by Tom Stewart, <a href="/wiki/District_attorney" title="District attorney">district attorney</a> for the 18th Circuit (and future <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">United States Senator</a>), and included, in addition to Herbert and Sue Hicks, Ben B. McKenzie and William Jennings Bryan. The trial was covered by famous journalists from the South and around the world, including <a href="/wiki/H._L._Mencken" title="H. L. Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a> for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Baltimore_Sun" title="The Baltimore Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a></i>, which was also paying part of the defense's expenses. It was Mencken who provided the trial with its most colorful labels such as the "Monkey trial" of "the infidel Scopes." It was also the first United States trial to be broadcast on national <a href="/wiki/Old_time_radio" title="Old time radio" class="mw-redirect">radio</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/ACLU" title="ACLU" class="mw-redirect">ACLU</a> had originally intended to oppose the <a href="/wiki/Butler_Act" title="Butler Act">Butler Act</a> on the grounds that it violated the teacher's individual rights, and was therefore unconstitutional. Mainly because of Clarence Darrow, this strategy changed as the trial progressed, and the earliest argument proposed by the defense once the trial had begun was that there was actually no conflict between evolution and the creation account in the Bible. In support of this claim, they brought in eight experts on evolution. Other than Dr. Maynard Metcalf, a zoologist from <a href="/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University" title="Johns Hopkins University">Johns Hopkins University</a>, the judge would not allow these experts to testify in person. Instead, they were allowed to submit written statements so that their evidence could be used at the appeal. In response to this decision, Darrow made a sarcastic comment to Judge Raulston (as he often did throughout the trial) on how he had been agreeable only on the prosecution's suggestions, for which he apologized the next day, keeping himself from being found in <a href="/wiki/Contempt_of_court" title="Contempt of court">contempt of court</a>.</p>
<p>The presiding judge John T. Raulston was accused of being biased towards the prosecution which led him to frequently clash with Darrow. On the onset of the trial Raulston quoted Genesis and the Butler act, he also warned the Jury not to judge the merit of the law (which would become the focus of the trial) but on the violation of the act which he called a 'high misdemeanor'. The Jury Foreman himself wasn't convinced with the act but acted as most of the jury did on the instructions of the judge. <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By the later stages of the trial, Clarence Darrow had largely abandoned the ACLU's original strategy and attacked the literal interpretation of the Bible as well as Bryan's limited knowledge of other religions and science.</p>
<p>Only when the case went to appeal did the defense return to the original claim that the prosecution was invalid because the law was essentially designed to benefit a particular religious group, which would be <a href="/wiki/Constitutionality" title="Constitutionality">unconstitutional</a>.</p>
<p>In what proved to be his only extensive speech of the trial, Bryan responded to this theory on behalf of the state. Following Stewart's strategy, Bryan argued that the proposed scientific testimony was neither competent nor proper, given the legal issue in the case, which he insisted was simply whether Scopes had taught evolution in the Rhea County High School. To support his contention that evolution was morally pernicious, Bryan cited the famous <a href="/wiki/Leopold-Loeb" title="Leopold-Loeb" class="mw-redirect">Leopold-Loeb</a> trial involving Darrow the year before the Scopes Trial. Darrow had saved two rich young child murderers from the death sentence, and Bryan cited Darrow's own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This terrible crime was inherent in his organism, and it came from some ancestor ... Is any blame attached because somebody took <a href="/wiki/Nietzsche" title="Nietzsche" class="mw-redirect">Nietzsche</a>'s philosophy seriously and fashioned his life upon it? ... It is hardly fair to hang a 19–year–old boy for the philosophy that was taught him at the university.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bryan chastised evolution for teaching children that humans were but one of (precisely) 35,000 types of mammals and bemoaned the fact that human beings were descended "Not even from American monkeys, but from old world monkeys" (<i>World's Most Famous Court Trial</i>, 174–78).</p>
<p>Malone responded for the defense in a speech that was universally considered the oratorical triumph of the trial.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Arousing fears of "inquisitions," Malone argued that the Bible should be preserved in the realm of theology and morality and not put into a course of science. In his conclusion, Malone declared that Bryan's "duel to the death" against evolution should not be made one-sided by a court ruling that took away the chief witnesses for the defense. Malone promised that there would be no duel because "There is never a duel with the truth." The courtroom went wild when Malone finished, and Scopes declared Malone's speech to be the dramatic highpoint of the entire trial and insisted that part of the reason Bryan wanted to go on the stand was to regain some of his tarnished glory.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>On the sixth day of the trial, the defense ran out of witnesses. The judge declared that all of the defense testimony on the Bible was irrelevant and should not be presented to the jury (which had been excluded during the defense). During the court proceedings (7th day of the trial) the defense asked the judge to call Bryan as a witness to question him on the Bible as their own experts have been rendered irrelevant; Darrow had planned the day before and called Bryan a "Bible expert". This move surprised those present in the court, as Bryan was a counsel for the prosecution and Bryan himself (according to a journalist reporting the trial) never made a claim of being an expert; although he did tout his knowledge of the Bible.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> This testimony revolved around several questions regarding biblical stories and Bryan's beliefs (as shown below), this testimony culminated in Bryan declaring that Darrow was using the court to "slur the Bible" while Darrow replied that Bryan's statements on the Bible were "foolish"<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>On the seventh day of the trial, Clarence Darrow took the unorthodox step of calling William Jennings Bryan, counsel for the prosecution, to the stand as a witness in an effort to demonstrate that belief in the historicity of the Bible and its many accounts of miracles was unreasonable. Bryan accepted, on the understanding that Darrow would in turn submit to questioning by Bryan. Although Hays would claim in his autobiography that the cross-examination of Bryan was unplanned, Darrow spent the night before in preparation.

<p>An area of questioning involved the book of Genesis and if <a href="/wiki/Eve_(Bible)" title="Eve (Bible)" class="mw-redirect">Eve</a> was actually <a href="/wiki/Eve_(Bible)#The_Creation_of_Eve" title="Eve (Bible)" class="mw-redirect">created from Adam's rib</a>, where <a href="/wiki/Cain_and_Abel" title="Cain and Abel">Cain</a> got his wife, and how many people lived in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>. Darrow used these examples to show that the stories of the Bible could not be scientific and should not be used in teaching science with Darrow telling Bryan, "You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion."<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> Bryan's declaration in response was "The reason I am answering is not for the benefit of the superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him."<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Stewart objected, demanding to know the legal purpose of Darrow's questioning. Bryan, gauging the effect the session was having, snapped that its purpose was "to cast ridicule on everybody who believes in the Bible." Darrow, with equal vehemence, retorted, "We have the purpose of preventing bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the United States." (299)</p>
<p>A few more questions followed in the charged open-air courtroom. Darrow asked where Cain got his wife; Bryan answered that he would "leave the agnostics to hunt for her" (302–03). When Darrow addressed the issue of the <a href="/wiki/Eve_(Bible)#The_Temptation.2C_Fall.2C_and_Expulsion_from_the_Garden" title="Eve (Bible)" class="mw-redirect">temptation</a> of Eve by the <a href="/wiki/Serpent_(symbolism)#Judaic_and_Christian_mythology" title="Serpent (symbolism)">serpent</a>, Bryan insisted that the Bible be quoted verbatim rather than allowing Darrow to paraphrase it in his own terms. However, after another angry exchange, Judge Raulston banged his gavel, adjourning court and bringing the drama to a sudden close (303–04).</p>

<p>The confrontation between Bryan and Darrow lasted approximately two hours on the afternoon of the seventh day of the trial. It is likely that it would have continued the following morning but for Judge Raulston's announcement that he considered the whole examination irrelevant to the case and his decision that it should be "expunged" from the record. Thus Bryan was denied the chance to cross-examine the defense lawyers in return, although after the trial Bryan would distribute nine questions to the press to bring out Darrow's "religious attitude." The questions and Darrow's short answers were published in newspapers the day after the trial ended, with the <i>New York Times</i> characterizing Darrow as answering Bryan's questions "with his agnostic's creed, 'I don't know,' except where he could deny them with his belief in natural, immutable law."<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After the defense's final attempt to present evidence was denied, Darrow asked the judge to bring in the jury only to have them come to a guilty verdict:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We claim that the defendant is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue as to whether he taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After they were brought in, Darrow then addressed the jury, telling them that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We came down here to offer evidence in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so all we can do is to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not. . . . we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darrow closed the case for the defense without a final summation. Under Tennessee law, when the defense waived its right to make a closing speech, the prosecution was also barred from summing up its case.</p>
<p>Scopes never testified since there was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution. Scopes later admitted that, in reality, he was unsure of whether he had taught evolution (another reason the defense did not want him to testify), but the point was not contested at the trial (Scopes 1967:59–60).</p>
<p>After eight days of trial, it took the jury only nine minutes to deliberate. Scopes was found guilty on July 21 and ordered to pay a <a href="/wiki/US$" title="US$" class="mw-redirect">US$</a>100.00 <a href="/wiki/Fine_(penalty)" title="Fine (penalty)">fine</a> (approximately $1,165 when adjusted from 1925 for inflation). Raulston imposed the fine before Scopes was given an opportunity to say anything about why the court should not impose punishment upon him and after Neal brought the error to the judge's attention the defendant spoke for the first and only time in court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your honor, I feel that I have been convicted of violating an unjust statute. I will continue in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom&#160;— that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust (<i>World's Most Famous Court Trial</i> 313).</p>

<p><a name="Appeal_to_Supreme_Court_of_Tennessee" id="Appeal_to_Supreme_Court_of_Tennessee"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Scopes_Trial&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Appeal to Supreme Court of Tennessee">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Appeal to Supreme Court of Tennessee</span></h2>
<p>Scopes' lawyers appealed, challenging the conviction on several grounds.</p>
<p>First, they argued that the statute was overly vague because it prohibited the teaching of "evolution," a very broad term. The court rejected that argument, holding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evolution, like <a href="/wiki/Prohibition" title="Prohibition">prohibition</a>, is a broad term. In recent bickering, however, evolution has been understood to mean the theory which holds that man has developed from some pre-existing lower type. This is the popular significance of evolution, just as the popular significance of prohibition is prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors. It was in that sense that evolution was used in this act. It is in this sense that the word will be used in this opinion, unless the context otherwise indicates. It is only to the theory of the evolution of man from a lower type that the act before us was intended to apply, and much of the discussion we have heard is beside this case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, the lawyers argued that the statute violated Scopes' <a href="/wiki/Constitutional_right" title="Constitutional right">constitutional right</a> to <a href="/wiki/Free_speech" title="Free speech" class="mw-redirect">free speech</a> because it prohibited him from teaching evolution. The court rejected this argument, holding that the state was permitted to regulate his speech as an employee of the state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was an employee of the state of Tennessee or of a municipal agency of the state. He was under contract with the state to work in an institution of the state. He had no right or privilege to serve the state except upon such terms as the state prescribed. His liberty, his privilege, his immunity to teach and proclaim the theory of evolution, elsewhere than in the service of the state, was in no wise touched by this law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Third, it was argued that the terms of the Butler Act violated the <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_State_Constitution" title="Tennessee State Constitution">Tennessee State Constitution</a> which provided that "It shall be the duty of the <a href="/wiki/Tennessee_General_Assembly" title="Tennessee General Assembly">General Assembly</a> in all future periods of this government, to cherish literature and science." The argument was that the theory of the descent of man from a lower order of animals was now established by the preponderance of scientific thought, and that the prohibition of the teaching of such theory was a violation of the legislative duty to cherish science.</p>
<p>The court rejected this argument (<i>Scopes v. State</i>, 154 Tenn. 105, 1927), holding that the determination of what laws cherished science was an issue for the legislature, not the judiciary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The courts cannot sit in judgment on such acts of the Legislature or its agents and determine whether or not the omission or addition of a particular course of study tends "to cherish science."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth, the defense lawyers argued that the statute violated the <a href="/wiki/Establishment_Clause_of_the_First_Amendment" title="Establishment Clause of the First Amendment">Establishment Clause</a>, unconstitutionally establishing a state religion.</p>
<p>Writing for the court, Chief Justice <a href="/wiki/Grafton_Green" title="Grafton Green">Grafton Green</a> rejected this argument, holding that the Establishment Clause was designed to prevent the establishment of a state religion as had been the experience in <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">England</a> and <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Scotland" title="Church of Scotland">Scotland</a> at the writing of the Constitution, and held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. So far as we know, the denial or affirmation of such a theory does not enter into any recognized mode of worship. Since this cause has been pending in this court, we have been favored, in addition to briefs of counsel and various amici curiae, with a multitude of resolutions, addresses, and communications from scientific bodies, religious factions, and individuals giving us the benefit of their views upon the theory of evolution. Examination of these contributions indicates that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity among the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, the court held that while the statute <i>forbade</i> the teaching of evolution (as the court had defined it), it did not <i>require</i> the teaching of any other doctrine, so that it did not benefit any doctrine over the others.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, having found the statute to be constitutional, the court set aside the conviction on appeal because of a <a href="/wiki/Legal_technicality" title="Legal technicality">legal technicality</a>: the jury should have decided the fine, not the judge, since Tennessee judges could not at that time set fines above $50. Green added a totally unexpected recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The court is informed that the plaintiff in error is no longer in the service of the state. We see nothing to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case. On the contrary, we think that the peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a <a href="/wiki/Nolle_prosequi" title="Nolle prosequi">nolle prosequi</a> herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.</p>

<p>The trial revealed a growing chasm in American Christianity and two ways of finding truth, one "biblical" and one "scientific."

However in totality, the majority of Christians denounced evolution.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Edwards (2000) contradicts the conventional view that in the wake of the Scopes trial a humiliated fundamentalism retreated into the political and cultural background, a viewpoint evidenced in the movie "Inherit the Wind" and the majority of contemporary historical accounts. Rather, the cause of fundamentalism's retreat was the death of its leader, Bryan. Most fundamentalists saw the trial as a victory and not a defeat, but Bryan's death soon after created a leadership void that no other fundamentalist leader could fill. Bryan, unlike the other leaders, brought name recognition, respectability, and the ability to forge a broad-based coalition of fundamentalist and mainline religious groups to argue for the antievolutionist position.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The trial escalated the political and legal struggles between strict creationists and evolutionists to influence the extent to which evolution would be taught as science in Arizona and California schools. Before the Dayton trial only the <a href="/wiki/South_Carolina" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oklahoma" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> legislatures had dealt with anti-evolution laws or riders to educational appropriations bills.</p>
<p>After Scopes was convicted, creationists throughout the United States sought similar antievolution laws for their states.</p>
<p>By 1927, there were 13 states, both in the <a href="/wiki/Northern_United_States" title="Northern United States">North</a> and <a href="/wiki/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">South</a>, that considered some form of anti-evolution law. At least 41 bills or resolutions were introduced into the state legislatures, with some states facing the issue repeatedly. While most of these efforts were rejected, both <a href="/wiki/Mississippi" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arkansas" title="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> put anti-evolution laws on the books after the Scopes trial that would outlive the Butler Act.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> The Butler Act ended up serving as a model for the anti-evolution crusade, and the ACLU could not find a teacher to volunteer for another test case.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, crusaders included ministers R. S. Beal and Aubrey L. Moore in Arizona and members of the Creation Research Society in California. They sought to ban evolution as a topic for study or, at least, relegate it to the status of unproven theory perhaps taught alongside the biblical version of creation. Educators, scientists, and other distinguished laymen favored evolution. This struggle occurred later in the Southwest than elsewhere and persisted through the Sputnik era after 1957, which inspired increased trust in science in general and evolution in particular.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The opponents of evolution made a transition from the antievolution crusade of the 1920s to the creation science movement of the 1960s. Despite some similarities between these two causes, the creation science movement represented a shift from religious to scientific objections to Darwin's theory. Creation science also differed in terms of popular leadership, rhetorical tone, and sectional focus. It lacked a prestigious leader like Bryan, utilized scientific rather than religious rhetoric, and was a product of California and Michigan instead of the South.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" title=""><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The Scopes trial had both short and long term effects in the teaching of science in schools in the United States.

<p>The immediate effects of the trial are evident in the high school biology texts used in the second half of the 1920’s and the early 1930’s. Of the most widely used textbooks, there is only one which lists evolution in the index and in the wake of the trial, under the pressures of fundamentalist groups, the entry is countered with biblical quotations. <sup id="cite_ref-Effects_of_the_Scopes_Trial_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Effects_of_the_Scopes_Trial-28" title=""><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> The fundamentalist’s target slowly veered off of evolution in the mid 1930's.

<p>In 1958 the National Defence Education Act was passed with the encouragement of many legislators who feared the United States education system was falling behind that of the Soviet Union.

<p>Anticipating that Scopes would be found guilty, the press fitted the defendant for martyrdom and created an onslaught of ridicule. <i>Time'</i>s initial coverage of the trial focused on Dayton as "the fantastic cross between a circus and a holy war." <i>Life</i> adorned its masthead with monkeys reading books and proclaimed, "the whole matter is something to laugh about."<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> Hosts of cartoonists added their own portrayals to the attack (the greatest collection of cartoons available would be the 14 reprinted in <a href="/wiki/L._Sprague_de_Camp" title="L. Sprague de Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Great_Monkey_Trial" title="The Great Monkey Trial">The Great Monkey Trial</a></i>). Both <i><a href="/wiki/Literary_Digest" title="Literary Digest" class="mw-redirect">Literary Digest</a></i> and the popular humor magazine <i>Life</i> (1890–1930) ran compilations of jokes and humorous observations garnered from newspapers around the country.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the butt of these jokes was the prosecution and those aligned with it: Bryan, the city of Dayton, the state of Tennessee, and the entire South, as well as fundamentalist Christians and anti-evolutionists. Rare exceptions were found in the Southern press, where the fact that Darrow had saved <a href="/wiki/Leopold_and_Loeb" title="Leopold and Loeb">Leopold and Loeb</a> from the death penalty continued to be a source of ugly humor. The most widespread form of this ridicule was directed at the inhabitants of Tennessee.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Life</i> described Tennessee as "not up to date in its attitude to such things as evolution."<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Time</i> related Bryan's arrival in town with the disparaging comment, "The populace, Bryan's to a moron, yowled a welcome."<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Attacks on Bryan were predictably frequent and nasty: <i>Life</i> awarded him its "Brass Medal of the Fourth Class," for having "successfully demonstrated by the alchemy of ignorance hot air may be transmuted into gold, and that the Bible is infallibly inspired except where it differs with him on the question of wine, women, and wealth."<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> Papers across the country routinely dismissed the efforts of both sides in the trial, while the European press reacted to the entire affair with amused condescension.</p>
<p>Famously vituperative attacks came from the literary gadfly H.L. Mencken, whose syndicated columns from Dayton for the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> drew vivid caricatures of the "backward" local populace, referring to the people of Rhea county as "Babbits," "morons," "peasants," "hill-billies," "yaps" and "yokels." He chastised the "degraded nonsense which country preachers are ramming and hammering into yokel skulls." The nicest thing Mencken managed to say about the community was that "The Klan has never got a foothold here, though it rages everywhere else in Tennessee."<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> Mencken attempted to perpetuate a hoax, distributing flyers for the "Rev.

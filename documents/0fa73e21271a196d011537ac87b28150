<p><i><b>Sola fide</b></i> (<a href="/wiki/Latin_language" title="Latin language" class="mw-redirect">Latin</a>: by <a href="/wiki/Faith" title="Faith">faith</a> alone), also historically known as the doctrine of <b><a href="/wiki/Justification_(theology)" title="Justification (theology)">justification</a> by faith</b>, is a doctrine that distinguishes most <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestant</a> denominations from <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholicism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Christianity" title="Eastern Christianity">Eastern Christianity</a>, and most <a href="/wiki/Restorationists" title="Restorationists" class="mw-redirect">Restorationists</a> in <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>.</p>
<p>The doctrine of <i>sola fide</i> or "faith alone" asserts God's pardon for guilty sinners is granted to and received through faith or belief alone, to the exclusion of all human efforts or works. All humanity, it is asserted, is fallen and sinful, under the curse of God, and incapable of saving itself from God's wrath and curse. But God, on the basis of the life, death, and resurrection of his Son, <a href="/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ" class="mw-redirect">Jesus Christ</a> alone (<a href="/wiki/Solus_Christus" title="Solus Christus">solus Christus</a>), grants sinners judicial pardon, or <a href="/wiki/Justification" title="Justification">justification</a>, which is received only and solely through the divine gift of faith. Faith is seen as passive, merely receiving Christ and all his benefits, among which benefits are the active and passive righteousness of Jesus Christ. Christ's righteousness is <a href="/wiki/Imputed" title="Imputed" class="mw-redirect">imputed</a> (or accounted) by God to the believing sinner (as opposed to infused or imparted), so that the divine verdict and pardon of the believing sinner is based not upon anything in the sinner, nor even faith itself, but upon Jesus Christ and his righteousness alone, which are received through faith alone. <a href="/wiki/Justification" title="Justification">Justification</a> is by faith alone and is distinguished from the other graces of salvation, which always accompany justification. See the Protestant <a href="/w/index.php?title=Ordo_salutis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ordo salutis (page does not exist)">ordo salutis</a> for more detail on the doctrine of salvation considered more broadly than justification by faith alone.</p>
<p>Historic <a href="/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> (both <a href="/wiki/Lutheran" title="Lutheran" class="mw-redirect">Lutheran</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reformed" title="Reformed" class="mw-redirect">Reformed</a>) has held to sola-fide justification in opposition to Roman Catholicism especially, but also in opposition to significant aspects of Eastern Orthodoxy. Protestants exclude all human works (except the works of Jesus Christ, which form the basis of justification) from the legal verdict / pardon of justification. Thus, "faith alone" is foundational to Protestantism, and distinguishes it from other Christian communions. According to <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a>, justification by faith alone is the article on which the church stands or falls.</p>
<p>Christian traditions answer questions about the nature, function and meaning of justification quite differently. These issues include: Is justification an event occurring instantaneously or is it as an ongoing process? Is justification effected by divine action alone (<i><a href="/wiki/Monergism" title="Monergism">monergism</a></i>), by divine and human action together (<i><a href="/wiki/Synergy" title="Synergy">synergism</a></i>) or by human action? Is justification permanent or can it be lost? What is the relationship of justification to <a href="/wiki/Sanctification" title="Sanctification">sanctification</a>, the process whereby sinners become righteous and are enabled by the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Spirit" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> to live lives pleasing to God?</p>

<p>From 1510 to 1520, Luther lectured on the Psalms, the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians. As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as <a href="/wiki/Penance" title="Penance">penance</a> and <a href="/wiki/Righteousness" title="Righteousness">righteousness</a> by the Roman Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the church was corrupt in their ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity, the most important of which, for Luther, was the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Justification_(theology)" title="Justification (theology)">justification</a> — God's act of declaring a sinner righteous — by faith alone through God's grace. He began to teach that <a href="/wiki/Salvation" title="Salvation">salvation</a> or redemption is a gift of God's <a href="/wiki/Divine_grace" title="Divine grace">grace</a>, attainable only through faith in Jesus.<sup id="cite_ref-Wriedt_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Wriedt-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of God. When God's righteousness is mentioned in the gospel, it is God's action of declaring righteous the unrighteous sinner who has faith in Jesus Christ.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> The righteousness by which the person is justified (declared righteous) is not his own (theologically, <i>proper</i> righteousness) but that of another, Christ, (<i>alien</i> righteousness). "That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law," said Luther. "Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ"<sup id="cite_ref-faith_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-faith-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>. Thus faith, for Luther, is a gift from God, and ". . .a living, bold trust in God's grace, so certain of God's favor that it would risk death a thousand times trusting in it."<sup id="cite_ref-faith_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-faith-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> This faith grasps Christ's righteousness and appropriates it for the believer. He explained his concept of "justification" in the <a href="/wiki/Smalcald_Articles" title="Smalcald Articles">Smalcald Articles</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
<p>The first and chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised again for our justification (Romans 3:24-25). He alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world (<a href="/wiki/Gospel_of_John" title="Gospel of John">John</a> 1:29), and God has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (<a href="/wiki/Book_of_Isaiah" title="Book of Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 53:6). All have sinned and are justified freely, without their own works and merits, by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23-25). This is necessary to believe. This cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work, law or merit. Therefore, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us&#160;... Nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered, even though heaven and earth and everything else falls (<a href="/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark" title="Gospel of Mark">Mark</a> 13:31).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Traditionally, Lutherans have taught <i><a href="/wiki/Forensic" title="Forensic" class="mw-redirect">forensic</a></i> (or legal) justification, a divine verdict of acquittal pronounced on the believing sinner. God declares the sinner to be "not guilty" because Christ has taken his place, living a perfect life according to God's law and suffering for his sins. For Lutherans justification is in no way dependent upon the thoughts, words, and deeds of those justified through faith alone in Christ. The new obedience that the justified sinner renders to God through <a href="/wiki/Sanctification" title="Sanctification">sanctification</a> follows justification as a consequence, but is not part of justification. <sup id="cite_ref-sanct_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sanct-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>For Lutherans, justification provides the power by which Christians can grow in holiness. Such improvement comes about in the believer only after he has become a new creation in Christ. This improvement is not completed in this life: Christians are always "saint and sinner at the same time" (<i>simul iustus et peccator</i>)<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> — saints because they are holy in God's eyes, for Christ's sake, and do works that please Him; sinners because they continue to sin until death.</p>

<p>"Where sin has perverted the social climate, it is necessary to call for the conversion of hearts and appeal to the grace of God. Charity urges just reforms. There is no solution to the social question apart from the Gospel" CCC 1896.</p>
<p>The following is one of explanation given by <a href="/wiki/Trent" title="Trent">Trent</a> on <a href="/wiki/Justification_(theology)" title="Justification (theology)">justification</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In what manner it is to be understood, that the impious is justified by faith, and gratuitously. And whereas the Apostle saith, that man is justified by faith and freely, those words are to be understood in that sense which the perpetual consent of the Catholic Church hath held and expressed; to wit, that we are therefore said to be justified by faith, because faith is the beginning of human salvation, the foundation, and the root of all Justification; without which it is impossible to please God, and to come unto the fellowship of His sons: but we are therefore said to be justified freely, because that none of those things which precede justification-whether faith or works-merit the grace itself of justification. For, if it be a grace, it is not now by works, otherwise, as the same Apostle says, grace is no more grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Catholic position is not one of works alone. The Catholic Church has opposed that position well over one thousand years prior to the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Reformation</a> in the Councils of Carthage and Orange. The Church rejects "works of debt" and works of our "own righteousness" because these works are not done in grace, works are only good if they are done in grace.</p>
<p>In 1999 the Lutheran World Federation and the Roman Catholic Church jointly issued a statement, the <i><a href="/wiki/Joint_Declaration_on_the_Doctrine_of_Justification" title="Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification">Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification</a></i>, that stated that the LWF and the Roman Catholic churches agreed about the basics of Justification and lifted certain Roman Catholic <a href="/wiki/Anathema" title="Anathema">anathemas</a> formerly applying to the LWF member churches.<a href="http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/ecumenicaldialogue/romancatholic/jddj/declaration.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elca.org/ecumenical/ecumenicaldialogue/romancatholic/jddj/declaration.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.

<p><a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> elevated <i>sola fide</i> to the principal cause of the <a href="/wiki/Protestant_Reformation" title="Protestant Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, the rallying cry of the Protestant cause, and the chief distinction between <a href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant" class="mw-redirect">Protestant</a> Christianity and <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholicism" title="Roman Catholicism" class="mw-redirect">Roman Catholicism</a>. <a href="/wiki/John_Calvin" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a>, also a proponent of this doctrine, taught that "every one who would obtain the righteousness of Christ must renounce his own." According to Calvin, it is only because the sinner is able to obtain the good standing of the Son of God, through faith in him, and union with him, that sinners have any hope of pardon from, acceptance by, and peace with God.</p>
<p>While this precise terminology—"by faith alone"—does not appear in the <a href="/wiki/English_Bible_translations" title="English Bible translations" class="mw-redirect">English Bible</a> other than in <a href="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20James&amp;verse=2:24&amp;src=NIV" class="external text" title="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20James&amp;verse=2:24&amp;src=NIV" rel="nofollow">James 2:24</a> where its use in a particular context is certainly rejected<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup>, it is claimed to summarize the teaching of the <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, and especially the <a href="/wiki/Pauline_epistles" title="Pauline epistles">Pauline epistles</a>, which systematically reject the proposition that justification is by obedience to the Law of Moses. Protestants base this on the fact that the <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a> contains almost two hundred statements that appear to imply that faith or belief is sufficient for salvation. For example: "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." (<a href="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20John&amp;verse=11:25&amp;src=KJV" class="external text" title="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20John&amp;verse=11:25&amp;src=KJV" rel="nofollow">John 11:25</a>, emphasis added).

<p>The doctrine proposes that faith in Christ is sufficient for sinners to be accepted by God, to count them among his people, and to equip them with the motive of trust, gratitude and love toward God from which good works are to be done. Some Christian groups such as Catholics believe that faith is necessary for salvation but not sufficient; that is, they assert that <i>sola fide</i> is an error because, in addition to believing, God also requires obedience and acts of love and charity as a prerequisite for acceptance into his kingdom, and for the reward of eternal life. This is in line with the traditional view of faith as faithfulness [to God] in the <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>. See also <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament#Christian_view_of_the_Law" title="Old Testament">Christian view of the Old Testament Law</a>.</p>
<p>The precise relationship between faith and good works remains as an area of controversy in some Protestant traditions, see also <a href="/wiki/Law_and_Gospel" title="Law and Gospel">Law and Gospel</a>. Even at the outset of the Reformation, subtle differences of emphasis appeared. For example, because the <a href="/wiki/Epistle_of_James" title="Epistle of James">Epistle of James</a> emphasizes the importance of good works, Martin Luther sometimes referred to it as the "epistle of straw." Calvin on the other hand, while not intending to differ with Luther, described good works as a consequence or 'fruit' of faith. The <a href="/wiki/Anabaptist" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptists</a> tended to make a nominal distinction between faith and obedience. Recent meetings of scholars and clergy have attempted to soften the <a href="/wiki/Antithesis" title="Antithesis">antithesis</a> between Protestant and Catholic conceptions of the role of faith in salvation, which, if they were successful, would have far reaching implications for the relationship between most Protestants and the Catholic Church. These attempts to form a consensus are not widely accepted among either Protestants or Catholics, so <i>sola fide</i> continues to be a doctrinal distinctive of the Reformation churches, including Lutherans, Reformed and many <a href="/wiki/Evangelicalism" title="Evangelicalism">Evangelicals</a>. Nevertheless, some statements of the doctrine are interpreted as a denial of the doctrine as understood by other groups.</p>
<p>There is a semantic component to this debate as well, which has gained new attention in the past century. Both Latin and English have two words to describe convictions: one is more intellectual (English <i>belief</i>, Latin verb <i>credo</i>) and one carries implications of "faithfulness" (English <i>faith</i>, Latin <i>fides</i>). But Greek and German have only one (German <i>Glaube</i>, Greek <i>pistis</i>). Some historians have suggested that this semantic issue caused some of the disagreement:<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since July 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> perhaps Luther's supporters may have understood "salvation by faith alone" to mean "salvation by being faithful to Christ", while his opponents understood him to mean "salvation by intellectual belief in Christ". Since there are passages in Luther's works that could be taken to support either of these meanings, both sides were able to quote passages from Luther defending their interpretation of what he meant.</p>

This only would I learn of you, Receive ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? ... So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.... Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But the Scripture harh concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."</li>

<p>For a deeper understanding, it is important to note, that there is a distinction between the works necessary for salvation, and the works of the Law. One such example is Romans 3:28, which teaches whether <a href="/wiki/Circumcision_in_the_Bible" title="Circumcision in the Bible" class="mw-redirect">circumcision</a> is needed as a work of the Law. In contrast, there are works, such as those described in Matthew 25 (see above). However, the Mosaic law and the principles of the Gospel (such as the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Judgment of Matthew 25) correspond, and the latter fulfills, clarifies, and expands on the former. So a Protestant believer will claim that "the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good," (Romans 7:12) harmonizing the two principles of the same Bible.

<dl>
<dd><i>Article 23: The Justification of Sinners</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We believe that our blessedness lies in the forgiveness of our sins because of Jesus Christ, and that in it our righteousness before God is contained, as David and Paul teach us when they declare that man blessed to whom God grants righteousness apart from works.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And the same apostle says that we are justified "freely" or "by grace" through redemption in Jesus Christ. And therefore we cling to this foundation, which is firm forever, giving all glory to God, humbling ourselves, and recognizing ourselves as we are; not claiming a thing for ourselves or our merits and leaning and resting on the sole obedience of Christ crucified, which is ours when we believe in him.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That is enough to cover all our sins and to make us confident, freeing the conscience from the fear, dread, and terror of God's approach, without doing what our first father, Adam, did, who trembled as he tried to cover himself with fig leaves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, if we had to appear before God relying-- no matter how little-- on ourselves or some other creature, then, alas, we would be swallowed up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore everyone must say with David: "Lord, do not enter into judgment with your servants, for before you no living person shall be justified."
<dl>
<dd><i>Belgic Confession 1561 (French revision, 1619)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Question 86. Since then we are delivered from our misery, merely of grace, through Christ, without any merit of ours, why must we still do good works?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: Because Christ, having redeemed and delivered us by his blood, also renews us by his Holy Spirit, after his own image; that so we may testify, by the whole of our conduct, our gratitude to God for his blessings, and that he may be praised by us; also, that every one may be assured in himself of his faith, by the fruits thereof; and that, by our godly conversation others may be gained to Christ.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Question 87. Cannot they then be saved, who, continuing in their wicked and ungrateful lives, are not converted to God?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Answer: By no means; for the holy scripture declares that no unchaste person, idolater, adulterer, thief, covetous man, drunkard, slanderer, robber, or any such like, shall inherit the kingdom of God.

<dl>
<dd><b>I.</b> Those whom God effectually calls, He also freely justifies; not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous; not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone; nor by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness; but by imputing the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them, they receiving and resting on Him and His righteousness by faith; which faith they have not of themselves, it is the gift of God.

<dd>The New Testament makes it clear that the gift of salvation is received through faith. "By grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God" (Ephesians 2:8). By faith, which is also the gift of God, we repent of our sins and freely adhere to the gospel, the good news of God's saving work for us in Christ. By our response of faith to Christ, we enter into the blessings promised by the gospel. Faith is not merely intellectual assent but an act of the whole persons involving the mind, the will, and the affections, issuing in a changed life. We understand that what we here affirm is in agreement with what the Reformation traditions have meant by justification by faith alone (<i>sola fide</i>).

<dd><i>4.3 Justification by Faith and through Grace</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>25. We confess together that sinners are justified by faith in the saving action of God in Christ. By the action of the Holy Spirit in Baptism, they are granted the gift of salvation, which lays the basis for the whole Christian life. They place their trust in God's gracious promise by justifying faith, which includes hope in God and love for him. Such a faith is active in love and thus the Christian cannot and should not remain without works. But whatever in the justified precedes or follows the free gift of faith is neither the basis of justification nor merits it.

<dd>5.... Regarding the way in which salvation is appropriated by the believers, Lutherans, by teaching that justification and salvation are by grace alone through faith (sola gratia, sola fide), stress the absolute priority of divine grace in salvation. When they speak about saving faith they do not think of the dead faith which even the demons have (cf. James 2:19), but the faith which Abraham showed and which was reckoned to him as righteousness (cf. Gen. 15:6, Rom. 4:3,9). The Orthodox also affirm the absolute priority of divine grace. They underline that it is God's grace which enables our human will to conform to the divine will (cf. Phil 2:13) in the steps of Jesus praying, "not as I will but as You will" (<a href="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=26:39&amp;src=!" class="external text" title="http://bibref.hebtools.com/?book=%20Matthew&amp;verse=26:39&amp;src=!" rel="nofollow">Matthew 26:39</a>), so that we may work out our salvation in fear and trembling (cf. Phil. 2:12). This is what the Orthodox mean by "synergy" (working together) of divine grace and the human will of the believer in the appropriation of the divine life in Christ. The understanding of synergy in salvation is helped by the fact that the human will in the one person of Christ was not abolished when the human nature was united in Him with the divine nature, according to the Christological decisions of the Ecumenical Councils. While Lutherans do not use the concept of synergy, they recognize the personal responsibility of the human being in the acceptance or refusal of divine grace through faith, and in the growth of faith and obedience to God. Lutherans and Orthodox both understand good works as the fruits and manifestations of the believer's faith and not as a means of salvation.

But he thereby brought Paul into direct verbal conflict with James, who says (James 2:24), "by works a man is justified, and not only by faith" ("nicht durch den Glauben allein"). It is well known that Luther deemed it impossible to harmonize the two apostles in this article, and characterized the Epistle of James as an "epistle of straw," because it had no evangelical character ("keine evangelische Art")."</li>

			<p>The <b>Theory of Positive Disintegration</b> (<b>TPD</b>) by <a href="/wiki/Kazimierz_D%C4%85browski" title="Kazimierz Dąbrowski">Kazimierz Dąbrowski</a> describes a theory of <a href="/wiki/Personality_development" title="Personality development">personality</a> development. Unlike mainstream <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, Dąbrowski's theoretical framework views psychological tension and <a href="/wiki/Anxiety" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a> as necessary for growth. These "disintegrative" processes are therefore seen as "positive," whereas people who fail to go through positive disintegration may remain for their entire lives in a state of "primary integration." Advancing into disintegration and into the higher levels of development is predicated on having developmental potential, including overexcitabilities, above-average reactions to stimuli. Unlike some other theories of development such as <a href="/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development" title="Erikson's stages of psychosocial development" class="mw-redirect">Erikson's stages of psychosocial development</a>, it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels. TPD is not a theory of stages, and levels do not correlate with age.</p>

<p>Kazimierz Dąbrowski (1902 - 1980), a <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Polish</a> <a href="/wiki/Psychiatrist" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychologist" title="Psychologist">psychologist</a>, developed the Theory of Positive Disintegration over his lifetime of clinical and academic work. The Theory of Positive Disintegration is a novel approach to personality development.</p>
<p>Dąbrowski's theory of personality development emphasized several major features including:</p>
<ul>
<li>personality is not a given universal trait, it must be created -- shaped -- by the individual to reflect his or her own unique character (personality shaping)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>personality develops as a result of the action of developmental potential (DP)(overexcitability and the autonomous factor), not everyone displays sufficient DP to create a unique personality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>developmental potential is represented in the population by a <a href="/wiki/Normal_distribution" title="Normal distribution">normal</a> (Bell) curve. Dąbrowski used a multilevel approach to describe the continuum of developmental levels seen in the population.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>developmental potential creates crises characterized by strong anxieties and depressions -- psychoneurosis -- that precipitate disintegration</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>for personality to develop, initial integrations based on instinct and socialization must disintegrate -- a process Dabrowski called positive disintegration</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the development of a hierarchy of individual values -- emotional reactions -- are a critical component in developing one's personality and one's autonomy, thus, in contrast to most psychological theories, emotions play a major role in this approach</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>emotional reactions guide the individual in creating his or her individual personality ideal, an autonomous standard that acts as the goal of individual development</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the individual must examine his or her essence and subsequently make existential choices that emphasize those aspects of essence that are higher and "more myself" and inhibit those aspects that are lower or "less myself" based upon his or her own personality ideal</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>critical components of individual development include autoeducation and autopsychotherapy</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Factors in development">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Factors in development</span></h3>
<p>Dąbrowski observed that most people live their lives in a state of "primary or primitive integration" largely guided by biological impulses ("first factor") and/or by uncritical endorsement and adherence to social convention ("second factor"). He called this initial integration Level I. Dąbrowski observed that at this level there is no true individual expression of the autonomous human self. Individual expression at Level I is influenced and constrained by the first two factors.</p>
<p>The first factor channels energy and talents toward accomplishing self-serving goals that reflect the lower instincts and biological ego — its primary focus is on survival and self-advancement. Often talents are used in antisocial or asocial ways. For example, at the lowest edge of Level I many criminals display this type of selfish behavior. They advance their own goals at the expense of others.</p>
<p>The second factor, the social environment (milieu) and <a href="/wiki/Peer_pressure" title="Peer pressure">peer pressure</a>, constrains individual expression and creativity by encouraging a group view of life and discouraging unique thought and expression. The second factor externalizes values and mores, thereby externalizing conscience. Social forces shape expectations. Behavior and one's talents and creativity are funneled into forms that follow and support the existing social milieu. "My mom says we should always be aware of what our lawn looks like because we want other people to think well of us when they drive by." Because conscience is derived from an external social context, so long as society holds ethical standards people influenced by second factor will behave ethically. However if a society, church, or government becomes corrupt, as in Nazi Germany, people strongly influenced by second factor will not dissent. <a href="/wiki/Socialization" title="Socialization">Socialization</a> without individual examination leads to a rote and robotic existence (the "robopath" described by <a href="/wiki/Ludwig_von_Bertalanffy" title="Ludwig von Bertalanffy">Ludwig von Bertalanffy</a>). Individual reactions are not unique, they are based upon social contexts ("I cry at funerals and laugh at weddings — everyone does"). According to Dąbrowski, people primarily motivated by second factor represent a significant majority of the general population.</p>
<p>Dąbrowski felt that our society was largely influenced by these lower two factors and could be characterized as operating at Level I. For example, our emphasis on corporate success ("a dog eat dog mentality") means that many <a href="/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" title="Chief Executive Officer" class="mw-redirect">CEOs</a> operate on the basis of first factor — they will quickly sacrifice another to enhance their own advancement. As well, our educational, political, corporate, and media systems are self promoting and discourage real examination or individual autonomy — the second factor. Alternatively, social justifications are often used: "of course I break the speed limit, everyone does." Or a soldier may explain that he or she was simply "following orders." Thus, this external value system absolves the individual of any individual responsibility.</p>
<p>Dąbrowski also described a group of people who display a different course: an individualized developmental pathway. These people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which Dąbrowski called negative adjustment) and move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. Dąbrowski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our <a href="/wiki/Status_quo" title="Status quo">status quo</a> and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc. If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy" title="Hierarchy">hierarchical</a> value structure (called positive adjustment). This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for Dąbrowski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One's talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be - how the world ought to be. The person expresses his or her "new" autonomous personality energetically through action, art, social change and so on.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Development potential">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Development potential</span></h3>
<p>Advanced development is often seen in people who exhibit strong developmental potential ("DP"). Developmental potential represents a constellation of genetic features, expressed and mediated through environmental interaction. Many factors are incorporated in developmental potential but three major aspects are highlighted: overexcitability (OE), specific abilities and talents, and a strong drive toward autonomous growth, a feature Dąbrowski called the "third factor."</p>
<p><i><b>Overexcitability</b></i></p>
<p>The most evident aspect of developmental potential is <a href="/wiki/Overexcitability" title="Overexcitability">overexcitability</a> (OE), a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. The greater the OE, the more intense are the day-to-day experiences of life. Dąbrowski outlined five forms of OE: psychomotor, sensual, imaginational, intellectual and emotional. These overexcitabilities, especially the latter three, often cause a person to experience daily life more intensely and to feel the extremes of the joys and sorrows of life profoundly. Dąbrowski studied human exemplars and found that heightened overexcitability was a key part of their developmental and life experience. These people are steered and driven by their value "rudder", their sense of emotional OE. Combined with imaginational and intellectual OE, these people have a powerful perception of the world. "I can hear the grass screaming when my dad cuts the lawn! I shout at him to STOP and he (again) just shakes his head. I can't bear to watch."</p>
<p>Although based in the nervous system, overexcitabilities come to be expressed psychologically through the development of structures that reflect the emerging autonomous self. The most important of these conceptualizations are dynamisms: biological or mental forces that control behavior and its development. "Instincts, drives and intellectual processes combined with emotions are dynamisms" (Dąbrowski 1972, 294). With advanced development, dynamisms increasingly reflect movement toward autonomy.</p>
<p><i><b>Abilities and talents</b></i></p>
<p>The second arm of developmental potential, specific abilities and talents, tends to serve the person's developmental level. As outlined, people at lower levels use talents to support egocentric goals or to climb the social and corporate ladders. At higher levels, specific talents and abilities become an important force as they are channeled by the person's value hierarchy into expressing and achieving the person's vision of his or her ideal personality and his or her view of how the world ought to be.</p>
<p><b>The third factor</b></p>
<p>The third aspect of developmental potential, the third factor, is a drive toward individual growth and autonomy. The third factor is critical as it applies one's talents and creativity toward autonomous expression, and second, it provides motivation to strive for more and to try to imagine and achieve goals currently beyond one's grasp. (Dąbrowski was clear to differentiate third factor from <a href="/wiki/Free_will" title="Free will">free will</a>. He felt that free will did not go far enough in capturing the motivating aspects that he attributed to third factor. For example, an individual can exercise free will and show little motivation to grow or change as an individual. Third factor specifically describes a motivation -- a motivation to become one's self. This motivation is often so strong that in some situations we can observe that one needs to develop oneself and that in so doing, it places one at great peril. This feeling of "I've gotta be me" especially when it is "at any cost" and especially when it is expressed as a strong motivator for self-growth is beyond the usual conceptualization ascribed to free will.</p>
<p>A person whose DP is high enough <i>will generally</i> undergo disintegration, despite any external social or family efforts to prevent it. A person whose DP is low will <i>generally not</i> undergo disintegration (or positive personality growth) even in a conducive environment.</p>
<p>The notion that some people have an innate potential for development that is determined by a higher sensitivity or overexcitability (analogous to the first aspect of DP) and by a related tendency to develop individual differences and autonomy from the group (analogous to the third aspect of DP) was independently developed by Elaine Aron (see <a href="/wiki/Highly_sensitive_person" title="Highly sensitive person">Highly sensitive person</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-ClinicalImplicationsJung_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ClinicalImplicationsJung-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> (although it should be noted that Aron's approach is substantially different than Dabrowski's.)</p>
<p><a name="A_mixed_blessing.3F" id="A_mixed_blessing.3F"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: A mixed blessing?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A mixed blessing?</span></h4>
<p>Dąbrowski called OE "a tragic gift" to reflect that the road of the person with strong OE is not a smooth or easy one. Potentials to experience great highs are also potentials to experience great lows. Similarly, potentials to express great creativity hold the likelihood of experiencing a great deal of personal conflict and <a href="/wiki/Stress_(medicine)" title="Stress (medicine)" class="mw-redirect">stress</a>. This stress both drives development and is a result of developmental conflicts, both intrapsychic and social. <a href="/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">Suicide</a> is a significant risk in the acute phases of this stress. The isolation often experienced by these people heightens the risk of <a href="/wiki/Self-harm" title="Self-harm" class="mw-redirect">self-harm</a>.</p>
<p>Dąbrowski advocated autopsychotherapy, educating the person about OEs and the disintegrative process to give him or her a context within which to understand intense feelings and needs. Dąbrowski suggested giving people support in their efforts to develop and find their own self-expression. Children and adults with high DP have to find and walk their own path, often at the expense of fitting in with their social peers and even with their families. At the core of autopsychotherapy is the awareness that no one can show anyone else the "right" path. Everyone has to find their own path for themselves. As Joseph Campbell described the knights on the Grail Quest: If a path exists in the forest, don't follow it, for though it took someone else to the Grail, it will not take you there, because it is not your path.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: The levels">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The levels</span></h2>
<p>The first and fifth levels are characterized by psychological integration, harmony, and little inner conflict. There is little internal conflict at Level I because just about every behavior is justified — it is either good for the individual and is therefore "right," or the individual's society endorses it and it is therefore "right." In either case, with a high level of confidence the individual acts as he or she perceives anyone else would, and does what anyone is "supposed to do." At Level V there is no internal conflict because what a person does is always in accord with their own internal sense of values. Of course, there is often external conflict at both Levels I and V.</p>
<p>Levels II, III and IV describe various degrees and types of dis-integration and literal dis-ease.</p>
<p><a name="Level_I:_Primary_Integration" id="Level_I:_Primary_Integration"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Level I: Primary Integration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Level I: Primary Integration</span></h3>
<p>As outlined above, the first level is called primitive or primary integration. People at this level are often influenced primarily by either prominent first factor (heredity/impulse) and/or second factor (social environment) forces. The majority of people at Level I are integrated at the environmental or social level (Dąbrowski called them average people); however, many also exhibit shades of both impulse and socialization. Dąbrowski distinguished the two subgroups of Level I by degree: "the state of primary integration is a state contrary to mental health. A fairly high degree of primary integration is present in the average person; a very high degree of primary integration is present in the psychopath" (Dąbrowski 1964, p. 121). Marked by selfishness and egocentrism (both reticent and explicit), those at level one development generally seek self-fulfillment above all, justifying their pursuits through a sort of "it's all about me" thinking; or, more simply put, they adhere strongly to the phrase "the end justifies the means", sometimes disregarding the severity of the "means". Many people who are considered "leaders" often fall into this category.</p>
<p><a name="Level_II:_Unilevel_Disintegration" id="Level_II:_Unilevel_Disintegration"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Level II: Unilevel Disintegration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Level II: Unilevel Disintegration</span></h3>
<p>The character of level II is reflected in its name: unilevel disintegration. The prominent feature of this level is an initial, brief and often intense <a href="/wiki/Crisis" title="Crisis">crisis</a> or series of crises. Crises are spontaneous and only occur on one level (and often involve only one dimension). These crises involve alternatives that may appear to be different but ultimately are on the same level.</p>
<p>Unilevel disintegration occurs during developmental crises such as puberty or menopause, in periods of difficulty in handling some stressful external event, or under psychological and psychopathological conditions such as nervousness and psychoneurosis. Unilevel disintegration consists of processes on a single structural and emotional level; there is a prevalence of automatic dynamisms with only slight self consciousness and self-control (Dabrowski 1964, p. 6).</p>
<p>Conflicts on the same level (horizontal) produce ambitendencies and ambivalences: the person is equally attracted by different but equivalent choices on the same level (ambitendencies) and is not able to decide what to do because he or she has no real preference between the choices (ambivalences). If developmental forces are strong enough, ultimately, the person is thrust into an <a href="/wiki/Existentialism" title="Existentialism">existential</a> crisis: one's social rationales no longer account for one's experiences and there are no alternative explanations. During this phase, existential despair is the predominant emotion. The resolution of this phase begins as individually chosen values begin to replace <a href="/wiki/Social_mores" title="Social mores" class="mw-redirect">social mores</a> that have been ingrained by rote and are integrated into a new hierarchy of personal values. These new values often conflict with the person's previous social values. Many of the status quo explanations for the "way things are," learned through education and from the social order, collapse under conscious, individual scrutiny. This causes more conflicts focused on the person's analysis of his or her own reactions to the world at large and of the behavior of self and others. Common behaviors and the ethics of the prevailing social order come to be seen as inadequate, wrong or hypocritical. Positive maladjustment prevails. For Dabrowski, these crises represent a strong potential for development toward personal growth and mental health. Using a positive definition, mental health reflects more than social conformity: it involves a careful, personal examination of the world and of one's values, leading to the development of an individual personality.</p>
<p>Level II is a transitional period. Dabrowski said you either fall back, move ahead or end negatively, in suicide or <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" title="Psychosis">psychosis</a>. "Prolongation of unilevel disintegration often leads to reintegration on a lower level, to suicidal tendencies, or to psychosis" (Dabrowski 1964, p. 7).</p>
<p>The transition from Level II to Level III involves a fundamental shift that requires a phenomenal amount of energy. This period is the crossroads of development: from here one must either progress or regress. The struggle between Dabrowski's three factors reflects this transitional crisis: "Do I follow my instincts (first factor), my teachings (second factor) or my heart (third factor)?" The developmental answer is to transform one's lower instincts (automatic reactions like anger) into positive motivation, to resist rote and social answers, and to listen to one's inner sense of what one ought to do.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Level III: Spontaneous Multilevel Disintegration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Level III: Spontaneous Multilevel Disintegration</span></h3>
<p>Level III describes a new type of conflict: a vertical conflict between two alternatives that are not simply different, but that exist on different levels. One is literally higher and the other is lower in comparison. These vertical conflicts initially arise from involuntary perceptions of higher versus lower choices in life (because they are involuntary, Dabrowski called it spontaneous multilevel disintegration). You just look at something, maybe for the 1000th time (to use the words of <a href="/wiki/G._K._Chesterton" title="G. K. Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>), and it strikes you — you see this one thing differently and once you do, it changes things. You can no longer "go back and see it the way you did before." Dabrowski called this vertical dimension multilevelness. Multilevelness is a gradual realization of the "possibility of the higher" (a phrase Dabrowski used frequently) and of the subsequent contrasts between the higher and the lower in life. These vertical comparisons often illustrate the lower, actual behavior of a person in contrast to higher, imagined ideals and alternative idealized choices. Dabrowski believed that the authentic individual would choose the higher path as the clear and obvious one to follow (erasing the ambivalences and ambitendencies of unilevel conflicts). IF the person's actual behavior subsequently falls short of the ideal, internal disharmony and a drive to review and reconstruct one's life often follow. Multilevelness thus represents a new and powerful type of conflict, a conflict that is developmental in Dabrowski's approach.</p>
<p>These vertical conflicts are critical in leading to autonomy and advanced personality growth. If the person is to achieve higher levels, the shift to multilevelness must occur. If a person does not have the developmental potential to move into a multilevel view, then he or she will fall back from the crises of Level II to reintegrate at Level I. In the shift to multilevelness, the horizontal (unilevel), stimulus-response model of life is replaced by a vertical and hierarchical analysis. This vertical view becomes anchored by one's emerging individual value structure, and all events are seen in relation to personal ideals. These personal value ideals become the personality ideal: how the person wants to live his or her life. As events in life are seen in relation to this multilevel, vertical view, it becomes impossible to support positions that favor the lower course when higher goals can be identified (or imagined).</p>
<p><a name="Level_IV:_Directed_Multilevel_Disintegration" id="Level_IV:_Directed_Multilevel_Disintegration"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Level IV: Directed Multilevel Disintegration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Level IV: Directed Multilevel Disintegration</span></h3>
<p>In Level IV the person takes full control of his or her development. The involuntary spontaneous development of Level III is replaced by a deliberate, conscious and self-directed review of life from the multilevel perspective. This level marks the real emergence of the third factor, described by Dabrowski as an autonomous factor "of conscious choice (valuation) by which one affirms or rejects certain qualities in oneself and in one's environment" (Dabrowski 1972, p. 306). The person consciously reviews his or her existing belief system and tries to replace lower, automatic views and reactions with carefully thought out, examined and chosen ideals. These new values will increasingly be reflected in the person's behavior. Behavior becomes less reactive, less automatic and more deliberate as behavioral choices fall under the influence of the person's higher, chosen ideals.</p>
<p>Social mores are reviewed and re-accepted by a conscious internalization when the individual feels it is appropriate. Likewise, when the person feels it is proper, a social value is reviewed and may be rejected to be replaced by a self perceived higher alternative value. One's social orientation comes to reflect a deep responsibility based on both intellectual and emotional factors. At the highest levels, "individuals of this kind feel responsible for the realization of justice and for the protection of others against harm and injustice. Their feelings of responsibility extend almost to everything" (Dabrowski 1973, p. 97). This perspective results from seeing life in relation to one's hierarchy of values (the multilevel view) and the subsequent appreciation of the potential of how life could be, and ought to be, lived. One's disagreements with the (lower level) world are expressed compassionately in doing what one can to help achieve the "ought."</p>
<p>Given their genuine (authentic) prosocial outlook, people achieving higher development also raise the level of their society. Prosocial here is not just support of the existing social order. If the social order is lower and you are adjusted to it, then you also reflect the lower (negative adjustment in Dabrowski's terms, a Level I feature). Here, prosocial is a genuine cultivation of social interactions based on higher values. These positions often conflict with the status quo of a lower society (positive maladjustment). In other words, to be maladjusted to a low-level society is a positive feature.</p>

<p>The fifth level displays an integrated and harmonious character, but one vastly different from that at the first level. At this highest level, one's behavior is guided by conscious, carefully weighed decisions based on an individualized and chosen hierarchy of personal values. Behavior conforms to this inner standard of how life ought to be lived and, thus, little inner conflict arises.</p>
<p>Level V is often marked by creative expression. Especially at Level V, problem solving and art represent the highest and noblest features of human life. Art captures the innermost emotional states and is based on a deep empathy and understanding of the subject. Often, human suffering and sacrifice are the subjects of these works. Truly visionary works, works that are unique and novel, are created by people expressing a vision unrestrained by convention. Advances in society, through politics, philosophy and religion, are therefore commonly associated with strong individual creativity or accomplishments.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12" title="Edit section: Therapy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Therapy</span></h3>
<p>The theory of positive disintegration has an extremely broad scope and has implications for many areas. One central application applies to psychological and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Dabrowski advocated a comprehensive, multidimensional diagnosis of the person's situation, including symptoms and developmental potentials.</p>
<p><i><b>Symptoms and developmental potentials</b></i></p>
<p>If the disintegration appears to fit into a developmental context, then the person is educated in the theory and encouraged to take a developmental view of his or her situation and experiences. Rather than being eliminated, symptoms are reframed to yield insight and understanding into life and the person's unique situation.</p>
<p><i><b>The importance of narratives</b></i></p>
<p>Dabrowski illustrated his theory through autobiographies of and biographies about those who have experienced positive disintegration. The gifted child, the suicidal teen or the troubled artist is often experiencing the features of TPD, and if they accept and understand the meaning of their intense feelings and crises, they can move ahead, not fall apart. The completion of an extensive autobiography to help the individual gain perspective on his or her past and present is a very important component in the autopsychotherapy process. In this process, the therapist plays a very small role and acts more as an initial stimulus than an ongoing therapist. Dabrowski asked clients to read his books and to see how his ideas may relate to their lives.</p>
<p><i><b>Autopsychotherapy</b></i></p>
<p>For Dabrowski, the goal of therapy is to eliminate the therapist by providing a context within which a person can understand and help oneself, an approach to therapy that he called autopsychotherapy. The client is encouraged to embark on a journey of self-discovery with an emphasis on looking for the contrast between what is higher versus what is lower within his or her personality and value structure. The person is encouraged to further explore his or her value structure especially as it relates to the rationale and justification of positions. Discrepancies between values and behavior are highlighted. The approach is called autopsychotherapy to emphasize the important role that the individual must play in his or her own therapy process and for that matter, in the larger process of personality development. The individual must come to see that he or she is in charge of determining or creating his or her own unique personality ideal and value structure. This includes a critical review of social mores and values that have been learned.</p>
<p><i><b>Overexcitability</b></i></p>
<p>Dabrowski also encouraged people to see their reactions (overexcitabilities) and their phenomenological view of the world in the context of their developmental potential. The experience of and reaction to, crises are a very important aspect of this approach and people are encouraged to experience personal crises with a positive and developmental view.</p>
<p>Dabrowski's views are somewhat reminiscent of Elaine Aron's approach to development for <a href="/wiki/Highly_sensitive_persons" title="Highly sensitive persons" class="mw-redirect">highly sensitive persons</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ClinicalImplicationsJung_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ClinicalImplicationsJung-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> It’s not immediately clear how Aron’s conceptualization of high sensitivity compares with, or differs from, Dabrowski’s conceptualization of overexcitability. However, Dabrowski's approach in terms of what role sensitivity plays and what we should do about it stands in stark contrast with Aron’s. Aron considers high levels of sensitivity to be an upsetting nuisance that must be avoided or managed to minimize its impact. For example, if an individual is bothered by crowd noise he or she should wear noise canceling headphones as protection. Or, if an individual is bothered by fluorescent lighting, he or she should avoid places where such lights are found. There is no sense of growth associated with higher sensitivity in Aron’s approach, in fact, they are considered more like an allergy that needs to be recognized and then avoided to prevent irritation.</p>
<p>Dabrowski reminds clients that without internal disease there is little stimulus for change or growth. Rather than trying to rapidly ameliorate symptoms, this approach encourages individuals to fully experience their feelings and to try to maintain a positive and developmental orientation to what they may perceive as strong depression or anxiety. Of course, this is a unique approach in today's world of seeking immediate and total relief of any unpleasant psychological experience (although it can be compared to Aron's to some extent).</p>

<p>Another primary focus is on education, in particular, over the past 25 years, on the experience of creative and <a href="/wiki/Gifted" title="Gifted" class="mw-redirect">gifted</a> students. Dabrowski hypothesized that these students will disproportionately show strong overexcitability and therefore will be prone to the disintegrative process.</p>

<p>In an appendix to Dabrowski (1967), results of investigations done in 1962 with Polish youth are reported. Specifically, "a group of gifted children and young people, aged 8 to 23" were examined (p. 251). Of the 80 youth studied, 30 were "intellectually gifted" and 50 were from "drama, ballet, and plastic art schools" (p. 251). Dabrowski found that every one of the children displayed overexcitability, "which constituted the foundation for the emergence of neurotic and psychoneurotic sets. Moreover it turned out that these children also showed sets of nervousness, neurosis, and psychoneurosis of various kinds and intensities, from light vegetative symptoms, or anxiety symptoms, to distinctly and highly intensive psychasthenic or hysterical sets" (p. 253). Dabrowski asked why these children should display such "states of nervousness or psychoneurosis" and suggested that it was due to the presence of OE (p. 255). "Probably the cause is more than average sensitivity which not only permits one to achieve outstanding results in learning and work, but at the same time increases the number of points sensitive to all experiences that may accelerate anomalous reactions revealing themselves in psychoneurotic sets" (p. 255).</p>
<p>The association between OE and giftedness appears to be borne out in the research (Lysy and Piechowski 1983; Piechowski 1986; Piechowski and Miller 1995). It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. Dabrowski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=15" title="Edit section: Key ideas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Key ideas</span></h2>
<p>The theory is based on numerous key ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>That our lower animal instincts (first factor) must be inhibited and transformed into "higher" forces for us to be Human (this ability to transform our instincts is what separates us from animals).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That the common initial personality integration, based upon socialization (second factor), does not reflect true personality.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At the initial level of integration, there is little internal conflict as when one “goes along with the group,” there is little sense of individual wrong doing. External conflicts often relate to the blockage of social goals – career frustrations for example. The social mores and values prevail with little question or conscious examination.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>True personality must be based upon a system of values that are consciously and volitionally chosen by the person to reflect their own individual sense of "how life ought to be" and their "personality ideal" — the ideal person they feel they "ought to be."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The lower animal instincts and the forces of peer groups and <a href="/wiki/Socialization" title="Socialization">socialization</a> are inferior to the autonomous self (personality) constructed by the conscious person.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To break down the initial integration, crises and disintegrations are needed, usually provided by life experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>These disintegrations are positive if the person can achieve positive and developmental solutions to the situation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Unilevel crises" are not developmental as the person can only choose between equal alternatives (go left or go right?).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A new type of perception involves "multilevelness," a vertical view of life that compares lower versus higher alternatives and now allows the individual to choose a higher resolution to a crisis over other available, but lower, alternatives — the developmental solution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Positive disintegration" is a vital developmental process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dabrowski developed the idea of "developmental potential" to describe the forces needed to achieve autonomous personality development.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Developmental potential includes several factors including innate abilities and talents, "overexcitability" and the "third factor."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Overexcitability is a measure of an individual’s level of nervous response. Dabrowski found that the exemplars he studied all displayed an overly sensitive nervous system, also making them prone to <a href="/wiki/Angst" title="Angst">angst</a>, depression and anxiety - psychoneuroses in Dabrowski's terms, a very positive and developmental feature.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The third factor is a measure of an individual's drive toward autonomy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dabrowski's approach is very interesting philosophically as it is Platonic, reflecting the bias of <a href="/wiki/Plato" title="Plato">Plato</a> toward <a href="/wiki/Essence" title="Essence">essence</a> — an individual's essence is a critical determinant of his or her developmental course in life. However, Dabrowski also added a major <a href="/wiki/Existential" title="Existential">existential</a> aspect as well, what one depends upon the anxieties felt and on how one resolves the day to day challenges one faces. Essence must be realized through an existential and experiential process of development. The characterization advanced by <a href="/wiki/Kierkegaard" title="Kierkegaard" class="mw-redirect">Kierkegaard</a> of "Knights of faith" may be compared to Dabrowski’s autonomous individual.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reviewed the role of logic and reasoning in development and concludes that intellect alone does not fully help us know what to do in life. Incorporates <a href="/wiki/Jean_Piaget" title="Jean Piaget">Jean Piaget</a>'s views of development into a broader scheme guided by emotion. Emotion (how one feels about something) is the more accurate guide to life's major decisions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When multilevel and autonomous development is achieved, a secondary integration is seen reflecting the mature personality state. The individual has no inner conflict; they are in internal harmony as their actions reflect their deeply felt hierarchy of values.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rejected <a href="/wiki/Maslow" title="Maslow" class="mw-redirect">Maslow</a>'s description of self-actualization (Dabrowski was a personal friend and correspondent of Maslow's). Actualization of an undifferentiated human self is not a developmental outcome in Dabrowski's terms. Dabrowski applied a multilevel (vertical) approach to self and saw the need to become aware of and to inhibit and reject the lower instinctual aspects of the intrinsic human self (aspects that Maslow would have us "embrace without guilt") and to actively choose and assemble higher elements into a new unique self - this process is what differentiates Man from the Animals. Dabrowski would have us differentiate the initial self into higher and lower aspects, as we define them, and to reject the lower and actualize the higher in creating our unique personality.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Secondary_Integration_versus_self-actualization." id="Secondary_Integration_versus_self-actualization."></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Positive_Disintegration&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16" title="Edit section: Secondary Integration versus self-actualization.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Secondary Integration versus self-actualization.</span></h2>
<p>People have often equated Maslow's concept of self-actualization with Dabrowski's level of secondary integration. There are some major differences between these two ideas, fundamentally, Maslow described self-actualization as a process where the self is accepted "as is" so, both higher and lower aspects of the self are actualized. Dabrowski introduces the notion that although the lower aspects may initially be intrinsic to the self, as human beings, we are able to become aware of their lower nature. We are able to develop self-awareness into how we feel about these low levels -- if we feel badly about behaving in these lower ways, then we are able to cognitively and volitionally decide to inhibit and eliminate these behaviors. In this way, the higher aspects of the self are actualized while the lower aspects are inhibited and, for Dabrowski, this is what is unique about humans and sets us apart from animals -- animals are not able to differentiate their lower instincts and therefore can not inhibit their animalistic impulses. Dabrowski has gone beyond Maslow's idea of self-actualization and it is not appropriate to equate the two authors on this point.</p>

<p>Both Dabrowski and his work have faced many obstacles. Personally, he was severely affected by both <a href="/wiki/World_Wars" title="World Wars" class="mw-redirect">World Wars</a>. His work always went against the grain. One can imagine a humanistic theory promoting personal growth in the political atmosphere of <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a> in the 1950s and 1960s. Another problem has been language. Dabrowski wrote in <a href="/wiki/Polish_language" title="Polish language">Polish</a> and translated his works into <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French</a> and <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>. <a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a> was the last language he learned and likely the most difficult in terms of capturing the subtleties of his ideas. In spite of these problems, Dabrowski persevered with his studies of human development, developed his theory and practiced psychiatry all his life.</p>
<p>Dabrowski died in 1980 and his students went on to explore careers of their own. Many of these students continue to study and speak on the theory, most advancing a deeply personal understanding of what the theory means to them. For many, the theory has become a lifelong friend.</p>
<p>Since 1980, there has been a small but consistent demand for Dabrowski’s works. This demand has largely evolved in the United States where Michael Piechowski applied his vision of the theory to gifted education. Many in education and in <a href="/wiki/Gifted_education" title="Gifted education">gifted education</a> have looked to Dabrowski’s theory to help provide a context for their students. Although a small part of the overall theory, this aspect has generated a number of Master’s and Ph.D. theses and introduced the theory to a large audience, an audience eager to learn more about Dabrowski and his theory.</p>
<p>The reader interested in Dabrowski has faced a serious scarcity of resources, especially of Dabrowski’s English works. His books are long out of print and rare, and his papers are held by a few people but not circulated. There are also many excellent Polish works by Dabrowski (about 20 books) on the theory, on psychotherapy, on education and on philosophy that await translation into English. Several efforts are underway to remedy this scarcity, including the Dabrowski website (see below), a current initiative to reprint Dabrowski’s English books (they are currently available as pdf files on a CD) and ongoing conferences and workshops.</p>
<p>The interested reader should Google Tillier and Dabrowski for more information about the availability of his works in English.</p>

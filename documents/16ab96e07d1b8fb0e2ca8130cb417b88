<p>Prior to the incident in Los Angeles, the <a href="/wiki/Attacks_on_North_America_during_World_War_II#Ellwood_shelling" title="Attacks on North America during World War II">Ellwood shelling</a>, in which the <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" title="Empire of Japan">Japanese</a> <a href="/wiki/Japanese_submarine_I-17" title="Japanese submarine I-17">submarine <i>I-17</i></a> surfaced and fired on an oil production facility near <a href="/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" title="Santa Barbara, California">Santa Barbara</a>, had occurred on February 23, 1942. Reports indicated that afterwards the submarine was heading south, the general direction of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Unidentified objects were reported over Los Angeles during the night of February 24 and the early morning hours of February 25, 1942. <a href="/wiki/Airstrike" title="Airstrike">Air raid</a> sirens were sounded throughout Los Angeles County at 2:25 a.m. and a total <a href="/wiki/Blackout_(wartime)" title="Blackout (wartime)">blackout</a> was ordered. Thousands of <a href="/wiki/Air_Raid_Precautions" title="Air Raid Precautions">air raid wardens</a> were summoned to their positions.</p>
<p>At 3:16 a.m. on February 25, the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade began firing 12.8-pound <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft" title="Anti-aircraft" class="mw-redirect">anti-aircraft</a> shells into the air at the object(s); over 1400 shells would eventually be fired <sup id="cite_ref-Maccabee_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Maccabee-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>. Pilots of the 4th Interceptor Command were alerted but their aircraft remained grounded. The artillery fire continued sporadically until 4:14 a.m. The objects were said to have taken about 20 minutes to have moved from over <a href="/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California" title="Santa Monica, California">Santa Monica</a> to above <a href="/wiki/Long_Beach,_California" title="Long Beach, California">Long Beach</a>. The "<a href="/wiki/All_clear" title="All clear" class="mw-redirect">all clear</a>" was sounded and the blackout order lifted at 7:21 a.m.</p>
<p>In addition to several buildings damaged by <a href="/wiki/Friendly_fire" title="Friendly fire">friendly fire</a>, three civilians were killed by the anti-aircraft fire, and another three died of heart attacks attributed to the stress of the hour-long bombardment.</p>
<p>The incident was front-page news along the U.S. Pacific coast, and earned some <a href="/wiki/Mass_media" title="Mass media">mass media</a> coverage throughout the nation. One <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Los_Angeles_Herald_Express&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Los Angeles Herald Express (page does not exist)">Los Angeles Herald Express</a></i> writer<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> who observed some of the incident insisted that several anti-aircraft shells had struck one of the objects, and he was stunned that the object had not been downed. Reporter Bill Henry of the <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> wrote <sup id="cite_ref-Maccabee_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Maccabee-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>, "I was far enough away to see an object without being able to identify it ... I would be willing to bet what shekels I have that there were a number of direct hits scored on the object."</p>
<p>Editor <a href="/wiki/Peter_Jenkins" title="Peter Jenkins">Peter Jenkins</a> of the <i><a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles_Herald_Examiner" title="Los Angeles Herald Examiner" class="mw-redirect">Los Angeles Herald Examiner</a></i> reported, "I could clearly see the V formation of about 25 silvery planes overhead moving slowly across the sky toward Long Beach." Long Beach Police Chief J.H. McClelland said<sup id="cite_ref-Maccabee_0-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Maccabee-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> "I watched what was described as the second wave of planes from atop the seven-story Long Beach City Hall. I did not see any planes but the younger men with me said they could. An experienced <a href="/wiki/Navy" title="Navy">Navy</a> observer with powerful <a href="/wiki/Zeiss" title="Zeiss">Carl Zeiss</a> binoculars said he counted nine planes in the cone of the searchlight. He said they were silver in color. The group passed along from one battery of searchlights to another, and under fire from the anti-aircraft guns, flew from the direction of <a href="/wiki/Redondo_Beach,_California" title="Redondo Beach, California">Redondo Beach</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inglewood,_California" title="Inglewood, California">Inglewood</a> on the land side of <a href="/wiki/Fort_MacArthur" title="Fort MacArthur">Fort MacArthur</a>, and continued toward <a href="/wiki/Santa_Ana,_California" title="Santa Ana, California">Santa Ana</a> and <a href="/wiki/Huntington_Beach" title="Huntington Beach">Huntington Beach</a>. Anti-aircraft fire was so heavy we could not hear the motors of the planes."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Identification_elusive" id="Identification_elusive"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Los_Angeles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Identification elusive">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Identification elusive</span></h2>
<p>Aside from unidentified airplanes, proposed explanations of the event then and now have included misidentification of <a href="/wiki/Weather_balloon" title="Weather balloon">weather balloons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sky_lanterns" title="Sky lanterns" class="mw-redirect">sky lanterns</a>, and Japanese <a href="/wiki/Fire_balloon" title="Fire balloon">fire balloons</a> or blimps.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>However, in the case of Japanese fire balloons (a proposal from later decades), they did not even exist in 1942. Some witnesses said the object caught in the searchlights was moving too slowly to have been a plane and there was common speculation in the newspapers that it was some type of balloon, such as a weather balloon or a Japanese <a href="/wiki/Blimp" title="Blimp">blimp</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Maccabee_0-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Maccabee-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Various problems noted with such explanations included the fact that many witnesses reported sighting multiple objects, not a single weather balloon or blimp, some moving at much faster aircraft speed, and the extreme unlikelihood that any balloon-like object could have survived such a massive bombardment. American balloon experts also opined it unlikely that the Japanese would use blimps since they had no fireproof helium to fill them and a blimp filled with explosive hydrogen gas would be even more unlikely to survive. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> In any case, no debris from the purported object or objects was ever reported on the ground following the bombardment.</p>
<p>Since some high government officials such as Army Chief of Staff Gen. <a href="/wiki/George_C._Marshall" title="George C. Marshall" class="mw-redirect">George C. Marshall</a> and Secretary of War <a href="/wiki/Henry_Stimson" title="Henry Stimson" class="mw-redirect">Henry Stimson</a> (see below) declared real aircraft to be involved, yet no satisfactory explanation was ever forthcoming, some <a href="/wiki/Ufology" title="Ufology">Ufologists</a> in the present day feel the incident should be treated as an early and true <a href="/wiki/UFO" title="UFO" class="mw-redirect">UFO</a> sighting, much like the so-called <a href="/wiki/Foo_fighter" title="Foo fighter">foo fighters</a> later reported during the war by Allied and Axis flight crews.</p>
<p><a name="Official_response" id="Official_response"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Los_Angeles&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Official response">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Official response</span></h2>
<p>Within hours of the end of the air raid (February 25), Secretary of the Navy <a href="/wiki/Frank_Knox" title="Frank Knox">Frank Knox</a> held a press conference and opined that the entire incident was a "<a href="/wiki/False_alarm" title="False alarm">false alarm</a>" due to anxiety and "war nerves". Many in the press doubted this explanation, some suspecting a <a href="/wiki/Cover_up" title="Cover up" class="mw-redirect">cover up</a>. An editorial in the <i><a href="/wiki/Long_Beach_Independent" title="Long Beach Independent" class="mw-redirect">Long Beach Independent</a></i> wrote, "There is a mysterious reticence about the whole affair and it appears that some form of <a href="/wiki/Censorship" title="Censorship">censorship</a> is trying to halt discussion on the matter." <sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Knox's comments quickly brought a defensive response from the Army that there definitely were flying aircraft and the battle was for real. The following day (February 26) Secretary of War Stimson backed them up. Citing a report from the Army Chief of Staff (Gen. Marshall--see <a href="#Related_documents" title="">next section</a>), Stimson said there may have been as many as 15 aircraft involved, some flying very slowly and others up to 200 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Stimson then commented that, "It seems reasonable to conclude that if unidentified airplanes were involved, they may be some from commercial sources, operated by enemy agents for the purpose of spreading alarm, disclosing location of anti-aircraft positions, or the effectiveness of blackouts." <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Speculation was then rampant as to where airplanes could have been based. Theories ran from a secret base in northern <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to Japanese <a href="/wiki/Submarine_aircraft_carrier" title="Submarine aircraft carrier">submarines stationed offshore with the capability of carrying planes</a>.</p>
<p>Others speculated that the incident was either staged or exaggerated to give coastal defense industries an excuse to move further inland. In fact, Secretary Knox, after declaring it was a false alarm, added that vital defense industries in southern California might have to be moved inland because of enemy activity along the coast. This provoked an acid front page editorial from the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>: "The reasoning is at least extraordinary. If there were no planes and no danger, wherein does this particular incident in any way support the theory that our great aircraft industry should be moved inland. Is it supposed to be damaged by false alarms and jittery nerves on the part of others? ...Least comprehensible of all is what the Navy head sees in the case to abet the desire of some government officials and some inland communities to transfer Coastal industries to the latter." <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The sharply conflicting statements from government and military officials as to what actually happened, plus lack of adequate explanation, brought other harsh criticism in newspaper editorials. In particular, if there truly was nothing to the incident, the possibility that Army personnel had fired heavy <a href="/wiki/Artillery" title="Artillery">artillery</a> shells for nearly an hour at nothing at all — killing three civilians in the process — led some critics to suggest that the <a href="/wiki/U.S._Army" title="U.S. Army" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Army</a> officers in charge were dangerously incompetent. <sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Some Congressmen also demanded answers. For example, Representative <a href="/wiki/Leland_M._Ford" title="Leland M. Ford">Leland Ford</a> of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Monica,_California" title="Santa Monica, California">Santa Monica</a> wanted a Congressional investigation. He was quoted stating, "...none of the explanations so far offered removed the episode from the category of 'complete mystification' ... this was either a practice raid, or a raid to throw a scare into 2,000,000 people, or a mistaken identity raid, or a raid to lay a political foundation to take away Southern California's war industries." <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the end, however, there was no Congressional investigation; it was never clearly established whether there were objects in the sky, or what their origin may have been if they did exist.</p>

<p>An Army history from 1942-1945 of West Coast defenses went into great detail on the raid without drawing any conclusions as to whether the raid was real or not. It noted that the Army had expected attacks on West Coast cities from early February and had been on high alert at the time the incident happened. Naval intelligence specifically expected an attack on Los Angeles sometime on February 24 or February 25. The history goes into the evidence that unidentified aircraft, sometimes traveling in V-formations, were both seen and heard by many Army personnel and also tracked by radar. The first radar contact of an unidentified aircraft occurred at 1:44 a.m. on February 25 and was confirmed by two other radar. An object 120 miles off the coast was picked up at 2:00 a.m. and was "well-tracked" by radar to within three miles of Los Angeles. The history also mentions that in some instances an object spotted may have been a weather balloon recently released. Lt. General <a href="/wiki/John_L._DeWitt" title="John L. DeWitt">John L. DeWitt</a>, commanding general of the Fourth Army and the Western Defense Command, wrote a month later: "It has been definitely ascertained that the blackout and antiaircraft firing... were caused by the presence of from one to five unidentified airplanes. While it is possible that these airplanes were launched from Japanese submarines, it is more likely that they were civilian or commercial planes, operated [by] unauthorized pilots." <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>“The Battle of Los Angeles”<br />
<br />
During the night of 24/25 February 1942, unidentified objects caused a succession of alerts in southern California. On the 24th, a warning issued by naval intelligence indicated that an attack could be expected within the next ten hours. That evening a large number of flares and blinking lights were reported from the vicinity of defense plants. An alert called at 1918 [7:18 p.m., Pacific time] was lifted at 2223, and the tension temporarily relaxed. But early in the morning of the 25th renewed activity began. Radars picked up an unidentified target 120 miles west of Los Angeles. Antiaircraft batteries were alerted at 0215 and were put on Green Alert—ready to fire—a few minutes later. The AAF kept its pursuit planes on the ground, preferring to await indications of the scale and direction of any attack before committing its limited fighter force. Radars tracked the approaching target to within a few miles of the coast, and at 0221 the regional controller ordered a blackout. Thereafter the information center was flooded with reports of “enemy planes, ” even though the mysterious object tracked in from sea seems to have vanished. At 0243, planes were reported near Long Beach, and a few minutes later a coast artillery colonel spotted “about 25 planes at 12,000 feet” over Los Angeles. At 0306 a balloon carrying a red flare was seen over Santa Monica and four batteries of anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, whereupon “the air over Los Angeles erupted like a volcano.” From this point on reports were hopelessly at variance.<br />
<br />
Probably much of the confusion came from the fact that anti-aircraft shell bursts, caught by the searchlights, were themselves mistaken for enemy planes. In any case, the next three hours produced some of the most imaginative reporting of the war: “swarms” of planes (or, sometimes, balloons) of all possible sizes, numbering from one to several hundred, traveling at altitudes which ranged from a few thousand feet to more than 20,000 and flying at speeds which were said to have varied from “very slow” to over 200 miles per hour, were observed to parade across the skies. These mysterious forces dropped no bombs and, despite the fact that 1,440 rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition were directed against them, suffered no losses. There were reports, to be sure, that four enemy planes had been shot down, and one was supposed to have landed in flames at a Hollywood intersection. Residents in a forty-mile arc along the coast watched from hills or rooftops as the play of guns and searchlights provided the first real drama of the war for citizens of the mainland. The dawn, which ended the shooting and the fantasy, also proved that the only damage which resulted to the city was such as had been caused by the excitement (there was at least one death from heart failure), by traffic accidents in the blacked-out streets, or by shell fragments from the artillery barrage.<br />
<br />
Attempts to arrive at an explanation of the incident quickly became as involved and mysterious as the “battle” itself. The Navy immediately insisted that there was no evidence of the presence of enemy planes, and Secretary [of the Navy, Frank] Knox announced at a press conference on 25 February that the raid was just a false alarm. At the same conference he admitted that attacks were always possible and indicated that vital industries located along the coast ought to be moved inland. The Army had a hard time making up its mind on the cause of the alert. A report to Washington, made by the Western Defense Command shortly after the raid had ended, indicated that the credibility of reports of an attack had begun to be shaken before the blackout was lifted. This message predicted that developments would prove “that most previous reports had been greatly exaggerated.” The Fourth Air Force had indicated its belief that there were no planes over Los Angeles. But the Army did not publish these initial conclusions. Instead, it waited a day, until after a thorough examination of witnesses had been finished. On the basis of these hearings, local commanders altered their verdict and indicated a belief that from one to five unidentified airplanes had been over Los Angeles. Secretary Stimson announced this conclusion as the War Department version of the incident, and he advanced two theories to account for the mysterious craft: either they were commercial planes operated by an enemy from secret fields in California or Mexico, or they were light planes launched from Japanese submarines. In either case, the enemy’s purpose must have been to locate anti-aircraft defenses in the area or to deliver a blow at civilian morale.<br />
<br />
The divergence of views between the War and Navy departments, and the unsatisfying conjectures advanced by the Army to explain the affair, touched off a vigorous public discussion. The Los Angeles Times, in a first-page editorial on 26 February, announced that “the considerable public excitement and confusion” caused by the alert, as well as its “spectacular official accompaniments, ” demanded a careful explanation. Fears were expressed lest a few phony raids undermine the confidence of civilian volunteers in the aircraft warning service. In Congress, Representative Leland Ford wanted to know whether the incident was “a practice raid, or a raid to throw a scare into 2,000,000 people, or a mistaken identity raid, or a raid to take away Southern California’s war industries.” <a href="/wiki/Wendell_Willkie" title="Wendell Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a>, speaking in Los Angeles on 26 February, assured Californians on the basis of his experiences in England that when a real air raid began “you won’t have to argue about it—you’ll just know.” He conceded that military authorities had been correct in calling a precautionary alert but deplored the lack of agreement between the Army and Navy. A strong editorial in the Washington Post on 27 February called the handling of the Los Angeles episode a “recipe for jitters,” and censured the military authorities for what it called “stubborn silence” in the face of widespread uncertainty. The editorial suggested that the Army’s theory that commercial planes might have caused the alert “explains everything except where the planes came from, whither they were going, and why no American planes were sent in pursuit of them.” The New York Times on 28 February expressed a belief that the more the incident was studied, the more incredible it became: “If the batteries were firing on nothing at all, as Secretary Knox implies, it is a sign of expensive incompetence and jitters. If the batteries were firing on real planes, some of them as low as 9,000 feet, as Secretary Stimson declares, why were they completely ineffective? Why did no American planes go up to engage them, or even to identify them?... What would have happened if this had been a real air raid?” These questions were appropriate, but for the War Department to have answered them in full frankness would have involved an even more complete revelation of the weakness of our air defenses.<br />
<br />
At the end of the war, the Japanese stated that they did not send planes over the area at the time of this alert, although submarine-launched aircraft were subsequently used over Seattle. A careful study of the evidence suggests that meteorological balloons—known to have been released over Los Angeles —may well have caused the initial alarm. This theory is supported by the fact that anti-aircraft artillery units were officially criticized for having wasted ammunition on targets which moved too slowly to have been airplanes. After the firing started, careful observation was difficult because of drifting smoke from shell bursts. The acting commander of the anti-aircraft artillery brigade in the area testified that he had first been convinced that he had seen fifteen planes in the air, but had quickly decided that he was seeing smoke. Competent correspondents like <a href="/wiki/Ernie_Pyle" title="Ernie Pyle">Ernie Pyle</a> and Bill Henry witnessed the shooting and wrote that they were never able to make out an airplane. It is hard to see, in any event, what enemy purpose would have been served by an attack in which no bombs were dropped, unless perhaps, as Mr. Stimson suggested, the purpose had been reconnaissance.</p>

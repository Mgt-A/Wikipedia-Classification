<p>Nearing was born <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="1883-08-06"><span class="mw-formatted-date" title="08-06"><a href="/wiki/August_6" title="August 6">August 6</a></span>, <a href="/wiki/1883" title="1883">1883</a></span> at Morris Run, <a href="/wiki/Tioga_County,_Pennsylvania" title="Tioga County, Pennsylvania">Tioga County, Pennsylvania</a>, the heart of the state's <a href="/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a> country. Nearing's grandfather, Winfield Scott Nearing, had arrived in Tioga County with his family in 1864, at the age of 35, when he accepted a job as a <a href="/wiki/Civil_engineer" title="Civil engineer">civil</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mining_engineer" title="Mining engineer" class="mw-redirect">mining engineer</a>. Before the end of the year he had assumed full control of mining operations as the superintendent of the Morris Run Coal Company, a position of authority which he held for the remainder of his workng life.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> An intense, driven man, Scott Nearing's grandfather studied science and nature, practiced gardening and carpentry, and regularly received crates of books from New York City, amassing a large personal library.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> In his memoirs written late in his life, Scott Nearing would recall his grandfather as one of the four most influential figures in his life.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing's upbringing was that of a young <a href="/wiki/Bourgeoisie" title="Bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a>, his mother employing a part-time tutor and two <a href="/wiki/Poles" title="Poles">Polish</a> servants to clean the gleaming white house atop a hill overlooking the town.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Scott's brother recalled that the citizens of Morris Run had treated the handsome and intelligent Scott "the way they would treat the heir to the nobleman.... They all treated him with awe."<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Nearing's father was a small businessman and <a href="/wiki/Stockbroker" title="Stockbroker" class="mw-redirect">stockbroker</a>, his mother a vigorous, energetic, and idealistic woman who Nearing later credited for providing an appreciation of the higher things in life â€” nature, books, and the arts.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite an upbringing in a life of privilege made possible at some level by the harsh anti-union politics of his patriarchal grandfather,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> young Scott Nearing nevertheless developed a social conscience, which one of his biographers describes as "a burr under his skin that none of his relatives acquired and that no interpretation satisfactorily explains."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Scott Nearing's radical <a href="/wiki/Weltanschauung" title="Weltanschauung" class="mw-redirect">worldview</a> would stay with him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Nearing graduated from high school in 1901 and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania Law School, "where corporate bias so violated his idealism that after one year he quit."<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Instead he studied oratory at <a href="/wiki/Temple_University" title="Temple University">Temple University</a> in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and enrolled in the <a href="/wiki/Wharton_School_of_Business" title="Wharton School of Business" class="mw-redirect">Wharton School of Business</a> of the University of Pennsylvania, where he immersed himself in the emerging science of economics. At the Wharton School, Nearing was deeply influenced by <a href="/wiki/Simon_Patten" title="Simon Patten">Simon Nelson Patten</a>, an innovative and unconventional educator and founding father of the <a href="/wiki/American_Economic_Association" title="American Economic Association">American Economic Association</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing was molded as a "Wharton man" for the current progressive era, one of the proverbial "best and brightest" trained in practical economics to be readied for a place as a responsible leader of the community.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> In the words of another of his students, Patten taught innovative thinking â€” "making use of creative intelligence to master new situations irrespective of received dogma."<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing seems to have found these new intellectual tools for potential social change to be exciting and liberating. He completed his undergraduate program in just three years, while simultaneously engaging in campus politics and competitive debate.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Nearing received his BS degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1905 and his PhD in Economics in 1909. From 1905 to 1907, he served as the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Child Labor Committee, a volunteer society working to solve the child labor problem in the state.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> From 1908 until 1915, Nearing himself taught economics and sociology at the Wharton School and Swarthmore College, authoring a stream of books on the economics and social problems.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing was a staunch advocate of a "new economics" which insisted</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"that the economists part company with the ominous pictures of an overpopulated, starving world, prostrate before the throne of 'competition,' 'individual initiative,' 'private property,' or some other pseudo-god, and tell men in simple, straightforward language how they may combine, re-shape, or overcome the laws and utilize them as a blessing instead of enduring them as a burden and a curse."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much as <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> drew radical implications from the ideas of the conservative <a href="/wiki/Hegel" title="Hegel" class="mw-redirect">Hegel</a>, Nearing took the economic logic of his department head, Simon Patten, and made radical inferences about wealth and the distribution of income that his mentor had himself hesitated to draw.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" title=""><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> He believed that unfettered wealth stifled initiative and impeded economic advancement, and hoped that progressive thinkers among the ownership class itself would come to realize the negative impact of economic parasitism and accept their civic duty of enlightened leadership.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing instead outlined an economic republicanism based upon "four basic democratic concepts â€” equality of opportunity, civic obligation, popular government, and human rights."<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" title=""><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Nearing's aggressive social activism in the classroom and through the printed word brought him into conflict with his own employers at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, resulting in his dismissal and his emergence as a <i><a href="/wiki/Cause_c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre" title="Cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre">cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre</a></i> of the American radical movement for the next decade. On the morning of June 16, 1915, Nearing's secretary telephoned him to report that a letter from the <a href="/wiki/Provost" title="Provost">Provost</a> had arrived, which noted that "as the term of your appointment as assistant professor of economics for 1914-1915 is about to expire, I am directed by the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania to inform you that it will not be renewed."<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" title=""><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> The Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania was heavily stacked with bankers, corporation lawyers, financiers, and corporation executives, and Nearing's writing had not gone unnoticed.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" title=""><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing's tenuous situation had been exacerbated by an open letter to <i>The North American</i> in which he challenged the right wing evangelist <a href="/wiki/Billy_Sunday" title="Billy Sunday">Billy Sunday</a> to apply the Gospel to the conditions of industrial capitalism, including "the railroad interests... the traction company... the manufacturers... the vested interests."<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" title=""><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Reaction to Nearing's dismissal from the academy was swift, with department head Patten and others issuing statements condemning the decision. Progressives in the Wharton School quickly compiled a summary of the facts of the case and sent it to 1500 newspapers, journals, and academics around the country.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" title=""><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> Even conservatives in the faculty were deeply troubled since, as one Wharton professor observed, "the moment Nearing went, any conservative statement became but the spoken word of a 'kept' professor."<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" title=""><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> Conversely, some radicals were satisfied for being validated in their belief of the conservative nature of the American academy. Socialist writer <a href="/wiki/Upton_Sinclair" title="Upton Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a> told Nearing in no uncertain terms in an open letter that "You do not belong in a university. You belong with us Socialists and free lances.... Instead of addressing small numbers of college boys, you will be able to address large audiences of men."<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" title=""><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> Retrospectively called by one historian "the most famous breach of academic freedom" of the era,<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" title=""><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> the University of Pennsylvania's action had the effect of making Scott Nearing into a public figure and fueled a long-running discussion about the proper role and rights of the teacher.</p>

<p>From the Fall of 1915, Scott Nearing was established as a radical "public man." He joined the American Union Against Militarism in 1916 and delivered a series of speeches condemning the "Preparedness" campaign then being promoted by Woodrow Wilson and the nation's political elite.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" title=""><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> He also remained a university professor, teaching Social Science at city-owned <a href="/wiki/University_of_Toledo" title="University of Toledo">Toledo University</a> from 1915 through 1917. The intense nationalistic feeling that swept the country now that America was embroiled at last in the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">war in Europe</a> spelled the end of Nearing's Toledo days, as he later recalled in his memoirs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Al Miller, Chairman of the Toledo Forum, asked me to come to his office. He greeted me pleasantly and then said, 'As you know, I am attorney for the Toledo Chamber of Commerce, on a permanent retainer. I am their legal spokesman; they are among my clients. They have directed me to introduce a resolution at the next meeting of the Toledo university trustees, ending your connection with the institution.' He waited a moment for this announcement to sink in.<br />
<br />
'Of Course,' I said quietly. 'That is one of the symptoms of war fever. Those who tell the truth or try to tell the truth are among the first victims of any war.'<br />
<br />
Al hurried on, 'You understand, there is nothing personal about this. You and I have worked together on the Forum and other projects with never a real disagreement, certainly never a fight.'<br />
<br />
'That is true,' I said, 'and I think our joint efforts have helped to make some real advances here in Toledo.'<br />

<p>Nearing packed up his things and moved to <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where he became a founding member of the broad anti-war organization the People's Council, the establishment of which took place at the so-called First American Conference for Peace and Democracy, held May 30-31, 1917.

<p>The prosecution attempted to show that Nearing, by writing against militarism, had illegally interfered with the ability of the United States government to recruit and conscript troops for its military activities in Europe. It spent its effort making Nearing admit that he had written and spoken against militarism and the war in Europe â€” which he was quite willing to do. But at the end of the trial, Nearing addressed the jury and made a key point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The prosecution has not been able to show a single instance in which recruiting was obstructed. They have not been able to show a single instance in which insubordination, disloyalty, and refusal to duty was caused."<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" title=""><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearing noted the evil implications of the government's attempt to illegalize written dissent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The only way to have intelligent public opinion is to have discussion, and the moment you check discussion you destroy democracy....<br />
<br />
"The Constitution does not guarantee us only the right to be correct, we have a right to be honest and in error. And the views that I have expressed in this pamphlet I expressed honestly. I believe they were right. The future will show whether or not I was correct, but under the laws, as I understand it, and under the Constitution, as I understand it, every citizen in this country has the right to express himself...on public questions."<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" title=""><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The judge in the case, Julius M. Mayer, dismissed the first two counts of the indictment, alleging conspiracy, without sending them to the jury. Following deliberation, the jury found Scott Nearing not guilty but the American Socialist Society guilty on the third and fourth counts of the indictment. On March 21, 1919, sentence was passed and the American Socialist Society was fined $3,000 (short of the maximum fine of $10,000),<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" title=""><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup> a sum which was ultimately collected through small donations from Socialists, labor groups, and civil libertarians in New York City.</p>

<p>The <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_America" title="Socialist Party of America">Socialist Party of America</a> split in the summer of 1919, with a factionalized <a href="/wiki/Communist" title="Communist" class="mw-redirect">Communist</a> movement leaving to forge an underground existence in the years after the <a href="/wiki/Palmer_Raids" title="Palmer Raids">Palmer Raids</a>.

Scott Nearing, 1919</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The dramatic decline of the size and strength of the Socialist Party in the first years of the 1920s took its toll on Nearing. The plummeting membership of the SPA â€” down below the 13,500 member mark for 1921 â€” stood in marked contrast to the new and rapidly-growing "Legal Political Party" of the Communists, the <a href="/wiki/Workers_Party_of_America" title="Workers Party of America">Workers Party of America</a> (WPA), which passed the Socialist Party in size after only a few months of existence in 1922.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" title=""><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing searched his soul in a lecture delivered in January 1923 at the Rand School, later published in the Socialist press, posing the question "What Can the Radical Do?" Nearing argued that the function of the radical was not administrative, but that of external critic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Communist radical of today will be the administrator of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical as badly as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be the business of the radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function as a part of the established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time."<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" title=""><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the radical's additional function to get in touch with like-minded people in the unions, cooperatives, and in the sphere of political propaganda, Nearing added. In the unions, it was the Communist Party's <a href="/wiki/Trade_Union_Educational_League" title="Trade Union Educational League">Trade Union Educational League</a> that was currently "the liveliest thing in the trade unionism of the Middle West," attempting at "boring from within" to radicalize the <a href="/wiki/American_Federation_of_Labor" title="American Federation of Labor">American Federation of Labor</a>. Outside the AF of L, on the "extreme left" was the <a href="/wiki/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW), attempting to found <a href="/w/index.php?title=Revolutionary_industrial_unionism&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Revolutionary industrial unionism (page does not exist)">revolutionary industrial unions</a>. Cooperators were, by the nature of their task, localized and conservative in their makeup, in Nearing's view. Publishing was in disarray, with <a href="/wiki/Charles_H._Kerr_%26_Co." title="Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co." class="mw-redirect">Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co.</a> disorganized by wartime repression and the nature of the economics of publishing such that the production of low cost books a veritable impossibility. With regards to political action, Nearing produced concrete figures to show that since 1912, membership in the Socialist Party had "steadily declined."<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" title=""><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing drew an explosive conclusion from this situation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That means, if it means anything, that in the United States as it is at present organized, the radical political movements are short-lived. And if that is true, then the Socialist Party has had its day. Through the Middle West recently I found the Socialist Party almost extinct. Since 1920 it has had first the Communist Party and then the Workers Party as rivals....<br />
<br />
"The Workers Party has fallen heir to the present radical political situation in the United States. Is it build to represent the American worker? So far the radical movement has represented the European worker in the United States. The opportunities for a radical political party are as great as, or greater than, ever before; the important problem before the Workers Party is to get radical ideas before the workers. Its second and more serious problem is to establish proper relations with Moscow. Moscow is strong; the Workers Party is weak; Moscow can dominate without any trouble."<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" title=""><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these misgivings, the potential of the growing organization appealed to Nearing over the malaise of the fading organization. Nearing finally applied for membership in the WPA in December 1924; he was, however, initially rejected from membership, living for the next two years as a non-party <a href="/wiki/Fellow_traveler" title="Fellow traveler">fellow traveler</a> of the organization. He finally gained admission to the Workers (Communist) Party only in 1927. Nearing went to work on the staff of the CP's daily newspaper, <i>The Daily Worker,</i> on May 9, 1928, remaining in that position until resigning in January 1930 to publish a study on <a href="/wiki/Imperialism" title="Imperialism">imperialism</a> which failed to meet the ideological scrutiny of the organization. According to at least one historian, Nearing was formally expelled from the CPUSA in 1930 in connection with this decision.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" title=""><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 1925, Nearing spent two months in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> visiting schools and talking with educational authorities. "It was a fascinating experience to visit this important educational laboratory in its opening experimental stages," he later recalled, noting that theories were then being actively tested with regards to subject matter, method of instruction, and social organization of students and teachers alike.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" title=""><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> The result of this visit was one of the first serious studies of the nascent Soviet educational system, a book entitled <i>Education in Soviet Russia.</i></p>
<p>In 1927, Nearing made his first trip to Asia, traveling to China by ship for a three month stay. En route, the <a href="/wiki/Kuomintang" title="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> Party split, with forces loyal to <a href="/wiki/Chiang_Kai_Shek" title="Chiang Kai Shek" class="mw-redirect">Chiang Kai Shek</a> attacking and summarily executing their former <a href="/wiki/Communist_Party_of_China" title="Communist Party of China">Communist</a> allies. As Nearing later recalled</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Leftists were liquidated on sight. The procedure was summary. When one was captured by Chiang's forces, his arms were held by two Chiang soldiers while a third, with a sword, hacked off his head. The remains were left lying as a warning to other Leftists to follow Chiang or perish. I saw some heads mounted on poles."<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" title=""><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there Nearing rather boldly gave a speech at Yenching University on his book, <i>The American Empire,</i> in a room darkened so that audience members could not be later identified and denounced. Upon his return to the United States, Nearing authored a book offering his views on the Chinese situation, entitled <i>Whither China?</i></p>
<p>Nearing remained a prominent figure of the American Left throughout the decade of the 1920s, producing a seemingly ceaseless series of pamphlets on various radical political themes. He was also engaged professionally on the lecture circuit, making use of an agent to arrange speaking tours for about 20 years. These speaking tours continued into the early 1930s, by which time public interest in attending live speeches and debates on political themes had waned and ill health forced Nearing's agent into retirement.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" title=""><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. 'We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We know that we can take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialst society are diverted and preoccupied by war.

<blockquote>
<p>"I have spent 70 years of study and travel in order to equip myself with information that would enable me to speak and write with authority on the course of world affairs. The authority I have sought is not in any sense political. It is the authority that results from collecting and classifying information on a scientific level and interpreting facts as I have found them.

<p>Through the years, these foreign affairs writings made use of several different channels of distribution.

Scott Nearing c. 1983.</div>

</div>
<p>During his 1919 trial for allegedly obstructing American military recruitment during World War I, at which he testified in his own defense, the prosecution asked Scott Nearing whether he was a "pacifist socialist." Nearing's reply was illuminating â€” he replied that he was a "pacifist" and left it at that. Prosecutor Earl B. Barnes was taken aback and asked for clarification:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Half a century later, writing in his 1972 autobiography, <i>The Making of a Radical</i>, Scott Nearing described himself as a <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" title="Pacifism">pacifist</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Vegetarianism" title="Vegetarianism">vegetarian</a>. In his autobiography he says "I became a vegetarian because I was persuaded that life is as valid for other creatures as it is for humans. I do not need dead animal bodies to keep me alive, strong and healthy. Therefore, I will not kill for food".<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> Nearing listed his four most influential teachers as <a href="/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Simon_Patten" title="Simon Patten">Simon Nelson Patten</a>, his grandfather and mother.

<p>Scott Nearing's journey over a century was neatly (albeit perhaps facilely) described by one biographer as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nearing's intellectual development followed a path of increasing awareness of the intransigence of the dominant classes of capitalist culture to adopt reforms that would spread the enlightenment and opportunities of the leisure classes to society as a whole. From the time of his firing from the University of Pennsylvania in 1915 through the aftermath of World War I, he experienced the limits of permissible questioning of conventional wisdom. His long, difficult journey from an orthodox reformer of the ruling class from within to a complete secessionist from capitalist cultural hegemony led him by 1932 to choose homesteading â€” an experiment Nearing called 'living the good life.'<br />
<br />
"In that spirit, Nearing moved through a series of secessions â€” from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the wilderness as if on a pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing's perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.<br />
<br />
"In his devotion to conscientious self-reliance, Nearing emerged as a twentieth-century colleague of Emerson and Thoreau."<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57" title=""><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view, that Nearing chose to "drop out" of politics and society itself and live life as a rugged agrarian individualist at one with nature, is a common interpretation â€” and certainly one with some merit. Another possible reading of Nearing's motivations and decision-making lies in his own writing. Nearing repeatedly drew inspiration from the life story of <a href="/wiki/Leo_Tolstoi" title="Leo Tolstoi" class="mw-redirect">Count Leo Tolstoi</a>, whose life Nearing clearly saw as analogous to his own:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Count Leo Tolstoi is a classic example of an individual in potential and actual conflict with his group. He was talented and had immense vitality. Until young manhood he accepted his place in the Tsarist social pattern and generally conformed to it. After some drastic experiences and much soul searching, Leo Tolstoi challenged the social system under which he lived to mortal combat. From that point until the day he left home and died in a railway station in his final attempt to win out against group pressures, his life consisted of combats with members of his family, with members of the neighboring nobility, with the army, with the Tsarist autocracy and with the established church."<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58" title=""><span>[</span>59<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tension between the dissident individual and the group was an unenviable one, Nearing believed. In the conflict between the solitary individual and the community, Nearing saw only three possible outcomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"(1) The individual may win out and impose himself and his ideas upon the group. The normal consequence of such an outcome is a personal dictatorship or the imposition upon the community of an <a href="/wiki/Oligarchy" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a> in which the dissident individual or individuals play a prominent role. (2) The division of the community into factions, one of which upholds the dissident individual, with a stalemate leading to feuding, rebellion, civil war. (3) The group wins out, imposes its will and eliminates the non-conformist. Such conflict sequences have occurred repeatedly in contemporary and in earlier history."<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59" title=""><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearingâ€™s chosen lifestyle of "Tolstoian," ascetic, rural self-sufficiency may be reasonably interpreted as the attempt of a self-aware dissident individual to avoid inevitably negative participation in the internal life of the group (be it government or political party), while retaining a keen and almost obsessive interest in the dynamics of society and the world as a whole.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Allen_Ginsberg" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Beat_Generation" title="Beat Generation">Beat Generation</a> poet, referred to Nearing as a "grand old man, a real mensch" in his poem <i><a href="/wiki/America_(poem)" title="America (poem)">America</a>.</i></p>

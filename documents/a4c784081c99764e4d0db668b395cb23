<p><b>Francis Bacon</b> (28 October 1909 – 28 April 1992) was an Irish born British figurative painter. Bacon's artwork is known for its bold, austere, homoerotic and often violent or nightmarish imagery, which typically shows room-bound masculine figures isolated in glass or steel geometrical cages set against flat, nondescript backgrounds. A late starter, Bacon did not begin painting until he was in his late 20s. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> His breakthrough came with the 1944 triptych <i><a href="/wiki/Three_Studies_for_Figures_at_the_Base_of_a_Crucifixion" title="Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion">Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion</a></i>, and it was this work and his heads and figures of the late 1940 through to the early 1960s that sealed his reputation as a chronicler of the grotesque. From the mid 1960's, Bacon mainly produced portrait heads of friends. He often said in interviews that he saw images "in series", and his artistic output often saw him focus on single themes for sustained periods (including his crucifixion, Papal heads, and later single and triptych heads series). Bacon began painting variations on the Crucifixion, and later focused on half human-half grotesque heads, best exemplified by the 1949 "Heads in a Room" series. Following the 1971 suicide of his lover George Dyer, his art became more personal, inward looking and preoccupied with death. The climax of this period came with his 1982 "Study for Self-Portrait", and his masterpiece, "<a href="/wiki/Study_for_a_Self_Portrait_-Triptych,_1985-86" title="Study for a Self Portrait -Triptych, 1985-86">Study for a Self Portrait -Triptych, 1985-86</a>".</p>
<p>Bacon was noted for his larger than life, but often severe, personality, and he spent much of his middle and later life eating, drinking and gambling in London's <a href="/wiki/Soho" title="Soho">Soho</a> with such people as <a href="/wiki/Lucian_Freud" title="Lucian Freud">Lucian Freud</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Deakin" title="John Deakin">John Deakin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Farson" title="Daniel Farson">Daniel Farson</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Bernard" title="Jeffrey Bernard">Jeffrey Bernard</a>, <a href="/wiki/Muriel_Belcher" title="Muriel Belcher">Muriel Belcher</a> and <a href="/wiki/Henrietta_Moraes" title="Henrietta Moraes">Henrietta Moraes</a>. Following Dyer's suicide he moved away from this circle and became less involved with <a href="/wiki/Rough_trade" title="Rough trade" class="mw-redirect">rough trade</a> to settle with his eventual heir John Edwards. Since his death, Bacon's reputation has steadily grown. He still draws admiration and disgust in equal measures; <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> famously described him as "that man who paints those dreadful pictures".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Bacon was the subject of two major <a href="/wiki/Tate" title="Tate">Tate</a> retrospectives during his life time and received a third in 2008. He always professed not to depend on preparatory works and was resolute that he never drew. Yet since his death, a number of sketches have emerged and although the Tate recognised them as canon, they have not yet been acknowledged as such by the art market. In addition, in the late 1990's, several presumedly destroyed major works, including <i>Popes</i> from the early 1950s and <i>Heads</i> from the 1960s, have surfaced on the art market which are considered equal to any of his "official" output.</p>

<p>Francis Bacon was born in <a href="/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> to an Irish-born mother,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> and Australian-born English father.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> His father, Eddy Bacon, was a veteran of the South African <a href="/wiki/Boer_War" title="Boer War" class="mw-redirect">Boer War</a> who became a <a href="/wiki/Horse_racing" title="Horse racing">racehorse</a> trainer. His mother Winnie (née Firth), an heiress to a <a href="/wiki/Sheffield" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> steel business and coal mine, was noted for her outgoing, gregarious nature, a stark contrast to her highly strung and argumentative husband.</p>
<p>Bacon was raised by the family <a href="/wiki/Nanny" title="Nanny">nurse</a>, Jessie Lightfoot. A sickly child with asthma and a violent allergy to dogs and horses, Bacon was often given <a href="/wiki/Morphine" title="Morphine">morphine</a> to ease his suffering during attacks. The family shifted houses often, moving back and forth between Ireland and England several times during this period, leading to a feeling of displacement that would remain with the artist throughout his life. In 1911 the family lived in Cannycourt House near <a href="/wiki/Kilcullen" title="Kilcullen">Kilcullen</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_Kildare" title="County Kildare">County Kildare</a>, but later moved to Westbourne Terrace, London, close by to where Eddy Bacon worked at the <a href="/wiki/Territorial_Army" title="Territorial Army">Territorial Force</a> Records Office.</p>

<p>On returning to Ireland after <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Bacon was sent to live for a time with his maternal grandmother, Winifred Supple, and her husband Kerry, at Farmleigh, <a href="/wiki/Abbeyleix" title="Abbeyleix">Abbeyleix</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_Laois" title="County Laois">County Laois</a>. Eddy Bacon later bought Farmleigh from his mother-in-law, though they soon moved again to Straffan Lodge in <a href="/wiki/Naas" title="Naas">Naas</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_Kildare" title="County Kildare">County Kildare</a>, the birthplace of his mother. Though Francis was a shy child, he enjoyed dressing up. This, coupled with his effeminate manner, often enraged his father and created a distance between them. A story emerged in 1992<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> of his father having had Francis horsewhipped by their Irish <a href="/wiki/Groom_(horses)" title="Groom (horses)">groom</a>. In 1924 his parents moved to <a href="/wiki/Gloucestershire" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, first to Prescott House in <a href="/wiki/Gotherington" title="Gotherington">Gotherington</a>, then to Linton Hall, situated near the border with <a href="/wiki/Herefordshire" title="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>. Francis spent eighteen months boarding at <a href="/wiki/Dean_Close_School" title="Dean Close School">Dean Close School</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cheltenham" title="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>, from the third term of 1924 until April 1926. This was to be his only brush with a formal education as he ran away after several weeks.</p>
<p>At a <a href="/wiki/Costume_party" title="Costume party">fancy-dress party</a> at the Firth family house at Cavendish Hall, <a href="/wiki/Suffolk" title="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, Francis dressed up as a <a href="/wiki/Flapper" title="Flapper">flapper</a> with an Eton crop, beaded dress, lipstick, high heels, and a long cigarette holder. In 1926 the family moved back to Ireland, and Straffan Lodge. His sister, Ianthe (b. 1921), recalls that Bacon made <a href="/wiki/Drawing" title="Drawing">drawings</a> of ladies with <a href="/wiki/Cloche" title="Cloche">cloche</a> hats and long cigarette holders.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Later that year, Francis was banished from Straffan Lodge following an incident in which his father found him admiring himself in front of a large mirror draped in his mother's <a href="/wiki/Undergarment" title="Undergarment">underwear</a>.</p>

<p>Bacon spent the autumn and winter of 1926 in London, with the help of an allowance of £3 a week from his mother's trust fund, living on his instincts, simply 'drifting', and reading <a href="/wiki/Nietzsche" title="Nietzsche" class="mw-redirect">Nietzsche</a>. When he was broke, Bacon found that by the simple expedient of rent-dodging and petty theft, he could manage a reasonable economy. To supplement his income, he briefly tried his hand at domestic service, but although he enjoyed cooking, he quickly became bored and resigned. He was sacked from a telephone answering position at a shop selling women's clothes in Poland Street, Soho, after writing a <a href="/wiki/Poison_pen_letter" title="Poison pen letter">poison pen letter</a> to the owner. He discovered that he attracted a certain type of rich man, an attraction he was quick to take advantage of, having developed a taste for good food and wine. One of the men was an ex-army friend of his father, another breeder of race-horses, named Harcourt-Smith. Bacon later claimed that his father had asked this friend to take him 'in-hand' and 'make a man of him'. Francis had a difficult relationship with his father, once admitting to being sexually attracted to him. Doubtless, Eddy Bacon was aware of his friend's reputation for virility, but not of his penchant for young men.</p>
<p>In the early Spring of 1927, Bacon was taken by Harcourt-Smith to the opulent, decadent, "wide open" Berlin of the <a href="/wiki/Weimar_Republic" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a>, staying together at the <a href="/wiki/Hotel_Adlon" title="Hotel Adlon">Hotel Adlon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> It is likely that Bacon saw <a href="/wiki/Fritz_Lang" title="Fritz Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)" title="Metropolis (1927 film)" class="mw-redirect">Metropolis</a></i> during this time.</p>
<p>Bacon spent two months in Berlin, though Harcourt-Smith left after just one — "He soon got tired of me, of course, and went off with a woman...I didn't really know what to do, so I hung on for a while, and then, since I'd managed to keep a bit of money, I decided to go to Paris." Bacon then spent the next year and a half in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>. He met Yvonne Bocquentin, pianist and connoisseur, at the opening of an exhibition. Aware of his own need to learn the <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">French language</a>, Bacon lived for three months with Madame Bocquentin and her family at their house near <a href="/wiki/Chantilly,_Oise" title="Chantilly, Oise">Chantilly</a>.

<p>Bacon returned to London in late 1928 or early 1929, and started work as an interior designer. He took a studio in a converted <a href="/wiki/Garage_(house)" title="Garage (house)">garage</a>, 17 Queensberry Mews West, <a href="/wiki/South_Kensington" title="South Kensington">South Kensington</a>, and shared the upper floor with Eric Alden (who was later to become his first collector) and his nanny, Jessie Lightfoot. In the first issue of Cahiers d'Art for 1929, Bacon saw Picasso's painted biomorphic figures, reproduced in an article by editor <a href="/wiki/Christian_Zervos" title="Christian Zervos">Christian Zervos</a>: <i>Picasso à <a href="/wiki/Dinard" title="Dinard">Dinard</a>, Été 1928</i>. (Likely to have been bought either from Zwemmers bookshop, on the <a href="/wiki/Charing_Cross_Road" title="Charing Cross Road">Charing Cross Road</a>, or in Paris.) The 1927 show at Rosenberg's in Paris had been of <a href="/wiki/Neoclassicism" title="Neoclassicism">Neo-classical</a> drawings, and it was the 1928 <i>Les Baigneuses</i> and <i>Le Baiser</i> in <i>Cahiers d'Art</i>, that gave Bacon his direction as a painter.</p>
<p>Bacon was befriended by Geoffrey Gilbey, then the racing correspondent for the <a href="/wiki/Daily_Express" title="Daily Express">Daily Express</a>, and for a time worked as his racing secretary. Gilbey had a house in Ormonde Gate, <a href="/wiki/Chelsea,_London" title="Chelsea, London">Chelsea</a>. Bacon advertised himself as a "gentleman's companion" in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, on the front page (then reserved for personal messages and insertions).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Among the many answers carefully vetted by Nanny Lightfoot was one from an elderly cousin of Douglas Cooper, at that time owner of one of the finest collections of <a href="/wiki/Modern_art" title="Modern art">modern art</a> in England. The gentleman, having paid Bacon for his services, found him part-time work as a <a href="/wiki/Telephone_operator" title="Telephone operator">telephone operator</a> in a London club and further sought Cooper's help in promoting Bacon's developing skill as a designer of furniture and interiors. Cooper also commissioned a desk from Bacon in battleship gray around this time.</p>
<p>In 1929 he met Eric Hall at the Bath Club, <a href="/wiki/Dover_Street" title="Dover Street">Dover Street</a>, London, where Bacon was working at the telephone exchange. Hall (who was general manager of <a href="/wiki/Peter_Jones_(department_store)" title="Peter Jones (department store)">Peter Jones</a>) was to be both <a href="/wiki/Patronage" title="Patronage">patron</a> and lover to Bacon, in an often torturous relationship.</p>

<p>The first show in the winter of 1929, at Queensberry Mews, was of Bacon's carpet rugs and furniture (a rug was purchased by Hall), but may have included <i>Painted screen</i> (c.1929–1930) and <i>Watercolour</i> (1929), both bought by Eric Alden. <i>Watercolour</i> (1929) his earliest surviving painting, seems to have evolved from his rug designs, in turn influenced by the paintings and <a href="/wiki/Tapestry" title="Tapestry">tapestries</a> of <a href="/wiki/Jean_Lur%C3%A7at" title="Jean Lurçat">Jean Lurçat</a>. Sydney Butler (daughter of <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Courtauld" title="Samuel Courtauld">Samuel Courtauld</a> and wife of <a href="/wiki/Rab_Butler" title="Rab Butler">Rab Butler</a>) commissioned a glass and steel table and a set of stools for the dining room of her <a href="/wiki/Smith_Square" title="Smith Square">Smith Square</a> house.... Bacon's Queensberry Mews studio was featured in the August 1930 issue of <i>The Studio</i> magazine, in a double page article entitled "The 1930 Look in British Decoration". The piece showed work including a large round mirror, some rugs and tubular steel and glass furniture largely influenced by the <a href="/wiki/International_style_(architecture)" title="International style (architecture)">International Style</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Breuer" title="Marcel Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Le_Corbusier#Furniture" title="Le Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a> / Charlotte Perriand and <a href="/wiki/Eileen_Gray" title="Eileen Gray">Eileen Gray</a>.</p>
<p>He returned to Germany in 1930. A dramatic studio portrait taken of Bacon by <a href="/wiki/Helmar_Lerski" title="Helmar Lerski">Helmar Lerski</a>, a Swiss photographer and cinematographer,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> probably dates from this visit. Bacon was later to tell <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Spender" title="Stephen Spender">Stephen Spender</a> that he had been very impressed by the work of a photographer who had produced striking effects using mirrors and natural light filtered through screens, but that he could not remember the artist's name. Later that year Francis Bacon met Roy de Maistre, an Australian painter who was to become a close friend and mentor. De Maistre's circle included <a href="/wiki/Graham_Sutherland" title="Graham Sutherland">Graham Sutherland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Moore" title="Henry Moore">Henry Moore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Patrick_White" title="Patrick White">Patrick White</a> and Douglas Cooper. A second exhibition was held between 4-22 November at 17 Queensberry Mews. Alongside de Maistre and Jean Sheppeard, Bacon showed four paintings and one print. <i>Gouache</i> (1929) may be the piece titled as <i>A Brick Wall</i> in the hand-list. <i>Painting</i> (1929–1930) (probably the work listed as <i>Tree by the Sea</i>) is Bacon's earliest surviving oil painting. Both were bought by Alden. The two other paintings (<i>Self-portrait</i> and <i>Two Brothers</i>) and <a href="/wiki/Printmaking" title="Printmaking">print</a> (<i>Dark Child</i> in an edition of three) are now lost.</p>
<p>Bacon left the Queensberry Mews West studio in 1931, and was not to have a settled space for some years. Bacon probably shared a studio with Roy de Maistre, about 1931/1932, at Carlyle Studios, (just off the Kings Road), in Chelsea. <i>Portrait</i> (1932) and <i>Portrait</i> (c.1931–1932) (the latter bought by Diana Watson) both show a round-faced youth with <a href="/wiki/List_of_skin_diseases" title="List of skin diseases" class="mw-redirect">diseased</a> skin (painted after Bacon saw <a href="/wiki/Ibsen" title="Ibsen" class="mw-redirect">Ibsen</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Ghosts_(play)" title="Ghosts (play)">Ghosts</a></i>), and date from a brief stay in a studio on the Fulham Road. In 1932, Bacon was commissioned by Gladys MacDermot, an Irish woman who had lived in Australia, to redesign much of the decoration and furniture of her flat at 98 Ridgmount Gardens in Bloomsbury. Bacon recalled that she was 'always filling me up with food'.</p>
<p>In April 1933, he moved to 71 Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea Road from <a href="/wiki/Ebury_Street" title="Ebury Street">Ebury Street</a>, where de Maistre had his temporary studio). The studio there was in a converted garage (like the Queensberry Mews West studio), a friend, the interior designer (and property developer) Arundell Clarke, had had his showroom there before moving on to Mayfair.</p>

<p>Douglas Cooper, then curator of the Mayor Gallery in <a href="/wiki/Cork_Street" title="Cork Street" class="mw-redirect">Cork Street</a>, arranged for one of Bacon's paintings, <i>Women in the Sunlight</i>, to be included in a group show in April 1933. It was also thanks to Cooper that Bacon's <i>Crucifixion</i> was reproduced in <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Read" title="Herbert Read">Herbert Read</a>'s book <i>Art Now</i> (opposite a 1929 <i>Baigneuse</i> by Picasso — plates 60/61). The publication was accompanied by an exhibition of the works, in October, at the Mayor Gallery, where <i>Crucifixion</i> was shown as <i>Composition. 1933</i>. <i>Crucifixion</i> was subsequently purchased by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Michael_Ernest_and_Sadler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Michael Ernest and Sadler (page does not exist)">Sir Michael Sadler</a> (who, other than friends or relations, was the first to buy a painting), and who also commissioned a second version, <i>Crucifixion</i> (chalk, gouache and pencil), and sent Bacon an <a href="/wiki/X-ray" title="X-ray">x-ray</a> photograph of his own <a href="/wiki/Skull" title="Skull">skull</a>, with a request that he paint a portrait from it.

<i>Composition (Figure)</i> (1933) (gouache, pastel and pen and ink on paper)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the start of 1934, with the help of Arundell Clarke, who had just taken over the building, Bacon set up a gallery space in the cellar of Sunderland House, <a href="/wiki/Curzon_Street" title="Curzon Street">Curzon Street</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mayfair" title="Mayfair">Mayfair</a>, with plans to deal in his own work and organize his own shows. In February 1934, Bacon held his first solo show, <i>Paintings by Francis Bacon</i>, of seven of his oil paintings and five or six <a href="/wiki/Gouache" title="Gouache">gouaches</a>, at the new Transition gallery. This was to be the only show at the Transition gallery. All but two gouaches of figures in flight (<i>Composition (Figure)</i> (1933) (gouache, pastel and pen and ink on paper) and <i>Composition (Figures)</i> (1933) (gouache, pastel and pen and ink on paper)) purchased by his cousin Diana Watson were afterwards destroyed by Bacon. Among these was the <i>Wound for a Crucifixion</i>, destroyed despite having a prospective purchaser in Eric Alden, and one of a very few that Bacon was to express regret at its loss.</p>
<p>Two studio interiors survive from 1934: <i>Studio Interior</i> (1934) and <i>Corner of the Studio</i> (1934) (purchased by Gladys MacDermot). <i>Interior of a Room</i> survives from circa 1935 (c.1933 in Alley/Rothenstein).</p>
<p>Bacon visited Paris in 1935, purchasing there a second-hand book on <a href="/wiki/Oral_pathology" title="Oral pathology" class="mw-redirect">diseases of the mouth</a> containing high quality hand-coloured plates of both open mouths and oral interiors, which both haunted and obsessed him for the remainder of his life. (Bacon had <a href="/wiki/Paranasal_sinus" title="Paranasal sinus" class="mw-redirect">sinus</a> problems since childhood and had undergone an operation on the <a href="/wiki/Palate" title="Palate">roof</a> of his mouth at some stage in the mid-1930s.) He also saw, for the first of many times, <a href="/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein" title="Sergei Eisenstein">Eisenstein</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Battleship_Potemkin" title="The Battleship Potemkin">The Battleship Potemkin</a></i> in 1935,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> the scene of the nurse screaming on the <a href="/wiki/Potemkin_Stairs" title="Potemkin Stairs">Odessa steps</a> later becoming a major theme in his paintings, with the angularity of Eisenstein's image often combined with the thick red palette of his recently purchased medical tome.</p>
<p>In the Winter of 1935-6, Roland Penrose and <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Read" title="Herbert Read">Herbert Read</a>, making a first selection for the <i>International Surrealist Exhibition</i> (which was to be held in London from 11 June to 4 July 1936), visited his studio at 71 Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea, saw "three or four large canvases including one with a grandfather clock," but found his work "insufficiently <a href="/wiki/Surrealism" title="Surrealism">surreal</a> to be included in the show." Bacon claimed that Penrose had said to him "Mr. Bacon, don't you realize a lot has happened in painting since the <a href="/wiki/Impressionism" title="Impressionism">Impressionists</a>?" In 1937 (or late in 1936), Bacon moved from 71 Royal Hospital Road to the top floor of 1 Glebe Place, Chelsea, which Eric Hall had rented (and kept until 1943). <a href="/wiki/Patrick_White" title="Patrick White">Patrick White</a> had moved to London, into a small flat in Ebury Street, in 1936, and, on meeting de Maistre in his ground-floor studio there, quickly fell in love with him. The following year, White moved to the top two floors of the building where de Maistre now had his studio, on Eccleston Street, and commissioned from Bacon, who was by now a friend, a writing desk (with wide drawers and a red linoleum top). White also bought the glass and steel dining table from Rab and Sydney Butler.</p>
<p>In January 1937, at <a href="/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Agnew_and_Sons&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Thomas Agnew and Sons (page does not exist)">Thomas Agnew and Sons</a>, 43 Old Bond Street, London, Bacon was in a group show, <i>Young British Painters</i>, which included <a href="/wiki/Graham_Sutherland" title="Graham Sutherland">Graham Sutherland</a>, <a href="/wiki/Victor_Pasmore" title="Victor Pasmore">Victor Pasmore</a>, and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Roy_de_Maistre&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Roy de Maistre (page does not exist)">Roy de Maistre</a>. <a href="/wiki/Eric_Hall" title="Eric Hall">Eric Hall</a>, also a friend of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Jerry_Agnew&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Jerry Agnew (page does not exist)">Jerry Agnew</a>, organized the show; Agnew's was then known for shows of <a href="/wiki/Old_Master" title="Old Master">Old Master</a> paintings. Four works by Bacon were shown: <i>Figures in a Garden</i> (1936), purchased by Diana Watson; <i>Abstraction</i>, and <i>Abstraction from the Human Form</i>, known from magazine photographs (they prefigure <i>Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion</i> (1944) in variously having a <a href="/wiki/Tripod" title="Tripod">tripod</a> structure (<i>Abstraction</i>), bared <a href="/wiki/Tooth" title="Tooth">teeth</a> (<i>Abstraction from the Human Form</i>), and both being biomorphic in form); <i>Seated Figure</i> is lost entirely.</p>
<p>Only <i>Figures in a Garden</i> remains of paintings from 1936, however, a small <a href="/wiki/Sketch_(drawing)" title="Sketch (drawing)">sketch</a> in black ink on lined paper, <i>Biomorphic Drawing</i>, in the collection of the Estate, at the <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Lane_gallery" title="Hugh Lane gallery" class="mw-redirect">Hugh Lane gallery</a>, which resembles <i>Abstraction</i> (1936), may be a survivor from this year.</p>
<p>A small <a href="/wiki/Self-portrait" title="Self-portrait">self-portrait</a>, putatively dated to 1930 and identified with the <i>self-portrait</i> in the hand-list to the Queensberry Mews show, was exhibited at the <i>Fine Arts and Antiques Fair, Olympia</i>, London in 1998; however, it has been claimed on technical grounds that it dates from 1937 onwards (the canvas board on which it was painted was not available until then, although this has been disputed). Stylistically, the work fits best around the mid 1930s. The work has an unusual provenance (it was kept by Bacon until 1982 and then given away), but the attribution to Bacon is sound (although a detailed technical analysis remains to be done).</p>
<p>On 1 June 1940 Bacon's father died. Bacon was named sole <a href="/wiki/Trustee" title="Trustee">Trustee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Executor" title="Executor">Executor</a> of his father's will, which requested that the <a href="/wiki/Funeral" title="Funeral">funeral</a> be as 'private and simple as possible'.</p>

So, at the height of <a href="/wiki/The_Blitz" title="The Blitz">The Blitz</a>, Eric Hall rented a cottage for Bacon and himself at Bedales Lodge, Steep, near <a href="/wiki/Petersfield,_Hampshire" title="Petersfield, Hampshire" class="mw-redirect">Petersfield, Hampshire</a>. <i>Figure Getting Out of a Car</i> (c. 1939 - 1940) was painted here but is known only from an early 1946 photograph taken by Peter Rose Pulham (taken shortly before it was painted over by Bacon and retitled <i>Landscape with Car</i>). An ancestor to the biomorphic form of the central panel of <i>Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion</i> (1944), the composition was suggested by a photograph of Hitler getting out of a car at one of the <a href="/wiki/Nuremberg_rallies" title="Nuremberg rallies" class="mw-redirect">Nuremberg rallies</a>, (Bacon claims to have "copied the car and not much else.")</p>
<p><i>Man in a Cap</i>, and <i>Seated Man</i> (recto) / <i>Man Standing</i> (verso) (now separated), both on composition board and from about 1943, are abandoned works.

<p>Returning from Hampshire at the latter part of 1943, Bacon and Hall took the ground floor of 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington, <a href="/wiki/John_Everett_Millais" title="John Everett Millais">John Everett Millais</a>' old house and studio.

<p>- Excerpt from the October 1962 interview with David Sylvester for the BBC.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Graham_Sutherland" title="Graham Sutherland">Graham Sutherland</a> saw <i>Painting</i> (1946) in the Cromwell Place studio, and urged his dealer, Erica Brausen, then of the Redfern Gallery, to go to see the painting and to buy it. Brausen wrote to Bacon several times, and visited his studio in early autumn 1946 and promptly bought the work for £200. (<i>Painting</i> (1946) was shown in several group shows including in the British section of <i>Exposition internationale d'arte moderne</i> (18 November - 28 December 1946) at the <a href="/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_National_d%27Art_Moderne" title="Musée National d'Art Moderne" class="mw-redirect">Musée National d'Art Moderne</a>, for which Bacon travelled to Paris.)</p>
<p>Within a fortnight of the sale of <i>Painting</i> (1946) to the Hanover Gallery, with the proceeds, Bacon had decamped from London to <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo" title="Monte Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>. After staying at a succession of hotels and flats, including the Hôtel de Ré, Bacon settled in a large <a href="/wiki/Villa" title="Villa">villa</a>, La Frontalière, in the hills above the town. Eric Hall and Nanny Lightfoot would come to stay. Bacon spent much of the next few years in Monte Carlo, short visits to London apart. From Monte Carlo, Bacon wrote to Graham Sutherland and Erica Brausen. His letters to Erica Brausen show that he did paint there, but no paintings are known to survive.</p>
<p>In 1948, <i>Painting</i> (1946) finally sold to <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Barr" title="Alfred Barr" class="mw-redirect">Alfred Barr</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> for £240. Bacon wrote to Sutherland asking that he apply <a href="/wiki/Fixative" title="Fixative">fixative</a> to the patches of <a href="/wiki/Pastel" title="Pastel">pastel</a> on <i>Painting</i> (1946) before it was shipped to New York. <i>Painting</i> (1946) is now too fragile to be moved from MoMA for exhibition elsewhere.</p>

<i>Head I</i> (1948)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bacon returned to London and Cromwell Place to paint, late in 1948. <i>Head I</i> was shown at the <i>Summer Exhibition</i> at the Redfern gallery from July to September 1948. By the end of 1948 Erica Brausen, who had advanced Bacon money for works, left the Redfern Gallery. Brausen had found private capital to start her own gallery in Mayfair. In the spring, a Bacon painting, presumably <i>Head I</i>, was shown at her new Hanover Gallery (and was noted by <a href="/wiki/Wyndham_Lewis" title="Wyndham Lewis">Wyndham Lewis</a>, as a preview of the main show, in an exhibition review of 12 May 1949). Held between 8 November and 10 December 1949 at the Hanover Gallery, <i>Francis Bacon: Paintings; Robert Ironside: Coloured Drawings</i>, was, in effect, his first professional one-man show (Robert Ironside's watercolors were on an upper floor). A series of six paintings <i>Head I</i> to <i>Head VI</i>, with <i>Study from the Human Body</i> (1949) and <i>Study for Portrait</i> (1949) formed the core of the show with four other paintings by Bacon.</p>
<p>Bacon's paintings attracted the support of Wyndham Lewis writing in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Listener" title="The Listener">The Listener</a></i>. "The Hanover [Gallery] Show is of exceptional importance. Of the younger painters none actually paints so beautifully as Francis Bacon", Lewis wrote, adding: "Bacon is one of the most powerful artists in Europe today and he is perfectly in tune with his time".<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> The following year he wrote of another exhibition: "Three large new canvases by Bacon prove him once more to be the most astonishingly sinister artist in England, and one of the most original". <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><i>Head I</i> differs from <i>Head II</i> - <i>Head VI</i> in one important respect: while the first is painted on <a href="/wiki/Hardboard" title="Hardboard">hardboard</a> and dates from 1948 (or 1947-8), the rest of the series date from 1949 and are painted on the reverse of a (commercially) primed <a href="/wiki/Canvas" title="Canvas">canvas</a>.</p>
<p>"Well, I was living once down in Monte Carlo and I had lost all my money, and, I had no canvases left and so, the few I had I just turned them, and I found that the, that the, what is called the wrong side, the unprimed side of the canvas worked for me very much better. So I've always used them. So it was just by chance that I had no money to buy canvases with." - Excerpt from an interview with Melvyn Bragg in <i>Francis Bacon</i> (1985), for the <a href="/wiki/South_Bank_Show" title="South Bank Show" class="mw-redirect">South Bank Show</a> for London Weekend Television.</p>
<p><i>Head II</i> is, for Bacon, very thickly painted, this was one of very few instances when he had been able to 'rescue' a painting after it had become overworked and the weave of the canvas clogged<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> (as happened with two abandoned works on canvas from the <i>Head</i> series, from 1949, also in the 1949 Hanover show). The arrow, or pointer, <a href="/wiki/Motif_(art)" title="Motif (art)" class="mw-redirect">motif</a> in <i>Head II</i> is taken from the book <i>Positioning in <a href="/wiki/Radiography" title="Radiography">Radiography</a></i> by Kathleen Clara Clark, 1939.</p>

<p><i>Head VI</i> was Bacon's first surviving engagement with <a href="/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez" title="Diego Velázquez">Velázquez</a>'s great <i>Portrait of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Innocent_X" title="Pope Innocent X">Pope Innocent X</a></i> (three 'popes' were painted in Monte Carlo in 1946 but were destroyed). The Cobalt Violet <a href="/wiki/Mozzetta" title="Mozzetta">mozzetta</a>, crimson in Velázquez's painting, may reflect Bacon's use of printed reproductions of the painting. Bacon later said that, although he admired "the magnificent color" of the Velázquez, Velázquez "wanted to make it as much like a <a href="/wiki/Titian" title="Titian">Titian</a> as possible but, in a curious way he cooled Titian".</p>
<p>An article by <a href="/wiki/Robert_Melville_(art_critic)" title="Robert Melville (art critic)">Robert Melville</a> titled <i>Francis Bacon</i> appeared in the December 1949 – January 1950 issue of <i>Horizon</i> magazine (edited by <a href="/wiki/Cyril_Connolly" title="Cyril Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a>).

<p><a href="/wiki/The_Colony_Room" title="The Colony Room">The Colony Room</a> is a private drinking club at 41 Dean Street, Soho, also known as Muriel's after <a href="/wiki/Muriel_Belcher" title="Muriel Belcher">Muriel Belcher</a>, the formidable proprietor. Belcher, who had run a club called the Music-box in <a href="/wiki/Leicester_Square" title="Leicester Square">Leicester Square</a> during the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">war</a>, had secured a 3pm - 11pm drinking licence for the Colony Room bar as a private-members club (<a href="/wiki/Public_house" title="Public house">public houses</a> had¨to, by law, close at 2:30pm). Bacon was a founding member, and joined the day after its opening in 1948. He was 'adopted' by Belcher as a 'daughter', and was allowed free drinks and £10 a week to bring in friends and rich patrons. It was here that Bacon became friends with <a href="/wiki/Lady_Rose_McLaren" title="Lady Rose McLaren">Lady Rose McLaren</a>.</p>
<p>Bacon met the painter and illustrator <a href="/wiki/John_Minton_(artist)" title="John Minton (artist)">John Minton</a> in 1948. Minton was soon to become a regular at 'Muriel's, as were the painters <a href="/wiki/Lucian_Freud" title="Lucian Freud">Lucian Freud</a>, <a href="/wiki/Frank_Auerbach" title="Frank Auerbach">Frank Auerbach</a>, Timothy Behrens, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Andrews_(artist)" title="Michael Andrews (artist)">Michael Andrews</a>, the two Roberts, Colquhoun and MacBride, and above all the sometime <i><a href="/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a></i> photographer, <a href="/wiki/John_Deakin" title="John Deakin">John Deakin</a>.

Sylvester had admired and written about his work (first writing about Bacon for a French periodical, <i>L'Age nouveau</i>, in 1948) but had erroneously perceived it to be a form of <a href="/wiki/Expressionism" title="Expressionism">Expressionism</a>. <i>Head I</i>, in particular, at the 1949 Hanover Gallery show, was, for Sylvester, proof of Bacon's importance as a <i>painter</i>. John Minton left for the West Indies in September 1950.

On condition that he did no formal teaching, Bacon agreed. So for three months, he was on hand to talk to the students for two days a week.</p>
<p><i>Painting</i> (1950) and <i>Fragment of a Crucifixion</i> (1950) were among the works shown at <i>Francis Bacon: Recent Paintings; Hilly: Paintings</i>, at the Hanover gallery, 14 September - 21 October 1950. Also <i>Study for Figure</i> (1950) (destroyed) and <i>Man at a Curtain</i> (1949) - an abandoned work.</p>

<i>Figure in Frame</i> (1950)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This series of three paintings after Velázquez were painted for the September 1950 Hanover gallery exhibition. The exhibition was advertised as <i>Francis Bacon: Three Studies from the Painting of Innocent X by Velázquez</i> but the series was withdrawn before the start of the show by Bacon. In November 1950, after Bacon had gone off to South Africa, the Hanover gallery offered on his behalf <i>Study after Velázquez</i> (1950) to the <a href="/wiki/Arts_Council_of_Great_Britain" title="Arts Council of Great Britain">Arts Council</a>, for the <a href="/wiki/Festival_of_Britain" title="Festival of Britain">Festival of Britain</a> show <i>Sixty Paintings for '51</i>. On his return in May, Bacon again withdrew the painting before it was shown, although it is in the catalogue to the exhibition. <i>Study after Velázquez</i> (1950) and <i>Study after Velázquez II</i> (1950) were sent to his art supplier for the frames and stretchers to be reused. Bacon apparently believed them destroyed.</p>
<p><i>Study after Velázquez</i> (1950) and <i>Study after Velázquez II</i> (1950) were rediscovered carefully rolled-up at Bacon's art supplier in September 1998 (and shown at the Tony Shafrazi gallery). <i>Study after Velázquez II</i> (1950) (also known as <i>Untitled (Pope)</i> (1950)) is an abandoned work. <i>Study after Velázquez III</i> (1950) is destroyed (but was photographed). In January 1951 Bacon was featured in <i>World Review</i> in <i>The Iconoclasm of Francis Bacon</i> by Robert Melville (describing <i>Study after Velázquez</i> (1950) seen at the studio and on the destruction of the three paintings in the series of studies after Velázquez; <i>Fragment of a Crucifixion</i> (1950) and <i>Man at a Curtain</i> (1949) are shown in monochrome).</p>
<p><i>Study for Nude Figures</i> (1950) (also known as <i>Untitled (Crouching Figure)</i> (1950)), and <i>Figure in Frame</i> (1950) (also known as <i>Untitled (figure)</i> (1950-1)), were among the abandoned paintings found in storage after the painter's death. <i>Figure in Frame</i> (1950), in particular, is a compellingly beautiful wreck, with thin dry-brushed paint on raw linen over a spectral smear and scrapes of oil paint.</p>
<p>By 1950, Bacon's affair with Eric Hall had come to an end - he no longer appears on the electoral register with Bacon and Jessie Lightfoot at 7 Cromwell Place - but he was to remain a loyal patron, friend and supporter. During November 1950, Bacon visited his mother in South Africa. This suited his asthma better than spending winter in London. Bacon was impressed by the African landscapes and wildlife, and took photographs in <a href="/wiki/Kruger_National_Park" title="Kruger National Park">Kruger National Park</a>. On his return journey he spent a few days in <a href="/wiki/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, and wrote to Erica Brausen of his intent to visit <a href="/wiki/Karnak" title="Karnak">Karnak</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luxor" title="Luxor">Luxor</a>, and then go via <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> to <a href="/wiki/Marseilles" title="Marseilles" class="mw-redirect">Marseilles</a>. The visit confirmed his belief in the supremacy of Egyptian art, embodied by the <a href="/wiki/Great_Sphinx_of_Giza" title="Great Sphinx of Giza">Sphinx</a>. He returned in the Spring of 1951.</p>
<p>On 30 April 1951 Jessie Lightfoot, Bacon's old nurse, died at Cromwell Place. Bacon was gambling in <a href="/wiki/Nice" title="Nice">Nice</a> when he learnt of her death. Lightfoot was Bacon's closest companion and had joined him in London on his return from Paris, and had lived with him and Eric Alden at Queensberry Mews West, and with him and Eric Hall at the cottage near Petersfield, in Monte Carlo and at Cromwell Place. Stricken, Bacon sold the 7 Cromwell Place apartment.</p>

<p>In 1964, Bacon began a relationship with 39-year-old Eastender George Dyer, whom he met, he claimed, while the latter was burgling his apartment. A petty criminal with a history of <a href="/wiki/Borstal" title="Borstal">borstal</a> and prison, Dyer was a somewhat tortured individual, insecure, alcoholic, appearance obsessed and never really fitting in within the bohemian set surrounding Francis. The relationship was stormy and in 1971, on the eve of Bacon's major retrospective at the Paris <a href="/wiki/Grand_Palais" title="Grand Palais">Grand Palais</a>, Dyer committed suicide in the hotel room they were sharing, overdosing on <a href="/wiki/Barbiturate" title="Barbiturate">barbiturates</a>.

In 1974, Bacon met John Edwards, a young, illiterate Eastender with whom he formed one of his most enduring friendships.</p>
<p>Bacon died of a heart attack on 28 April 1992, in Madrid, Spain. He bequeathed his entire estate (then valued at £11 million) to John Edwards. Edwards, in turn, donated the contents of Francis Bacon's chaotic studio at 7 Reece Mews, <a href="/wiki/South_Kensington" title="South Kensington">South Kensington</a>, to the <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Lane_gallery" title="Hugh Lane gallery" class="mw-redirect">Hugh Lane gallery</a> in Dublin.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Bacon's studio contents were moved and the studio carefully reconstructed in the gallery. Additionally draft materials, perhaps intended for destruction, were according to Canadian Barry Joule bequeathed to Joule who later forwarded most of the materials to create the Barry Joule Archive in Dublin with other parts of the collection given later to the Tate museum.</p>
<p>The tiny and cramped nature of Bacon's London] studio and apartment were subjected to some critical analysis in an article in <a href="/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> by Aida Edemariam. She claims Bacon being frequently locked screaming for hours in a cupboard as a young boy, by a nanny, formed the basis of his preference for working in cramped conditions and his unwillingness to work on a larger scale.

I wasn't in Berlin very long, but I did see Berlin about 1927–28, which was, one of the, what is called, the great [decadent years, they say, of Berlin. And I went with a, somebody, who had picked me up, whatever you like to say, and we went and stayed at the Hotel Adlon, which is the most wonderful hotel, because I always remember, the wheeling the breakfast in the morning, with these wonderful trollies with enormous swans necks coming out of the four corners. And then, the night life of Berlin at that time, to go down the <a href="/wiki/Kurf%C3%BCrstendamm" title="Kurfürstendamm">Kurfürstendamm</a> and that kind of thing was really very exciting in those times because I had never seen anything from coming from a very puritanical country, in a way, like Ireland, going to a city which at that time was wide open, was very exciting for me." — from an interview with David Sylvester (March 1984) in <i>Francis Bacon: The Brutality of Fact</i> dir. Michael Blackwood, for the BBC, broadcast 16 November 1984 (used in interview 9, <i>Interviews with Francis Bacon</i> David Sylvester).</li>

And then I saw — or perhaps I even knew by then — the <i>Potemkin</i> film, and I attempted to use the <i>Potemkin</i> still as a basis on which I could also use these marvelous illustrations of the human mouth. It never worked out though." — from interview 2, (May 1966) (<i>Interviews with Francis Bacon</i> David Sylvester)</li>

<li id="cite_note-11"><b><a href="#cite_ref-11" title="">^</a></b> "La distinction aujourd'hui classique entre conscient et inconscient est très féconde, me semble-t-il. Elle ne recouvre pas tout à fait ce à quoi je pense par rapport à la peinture, mais elle a l'avantage de ne pas recourir à une explication métaphysique pour parler de ce qui échappe à la compréhension logique des choses. L'inconnu n'est pas renvoyé du côté de la mystique ou de quelque chose comme ça. Et c'est très important pour moi, parce que j'ai horreur de toute explication de cet ordre." ("The classic distinction today between the conscious and the <a href="/wiki/Unconscious_mind" title="Unconscious mind">unconscious</a> is a useful one I think. It doesn't quite cover what I think about painting, but it has the advantage of not having to resort to a metaphysical explanation to talk about what cannot be explained in rational terms. The unknown is not relegated to the realm of the mystical or something similar. And that's very important to me because I loathe all explanations of that sort.") – Francis Bacon Entretiens avec Michel Archimbaud, 1992 (Francis Bacon in conversation with Michel Archimbaud)</li>

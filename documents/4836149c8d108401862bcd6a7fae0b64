<dt>3-3-5 defense</dt>
<dd>A variation of the Nickel formation with 3 linemen (2 De &amp; 1 DT), 3 linebackers (2 OLB &amp; 1 MLB), and 5 defensive backs (3 CB, 1 SS &amp; 1 FS). Often called a <b>3-3 stack.</b> Also called the "Rule Breaker" due to the fact that it often changes blocking schemes for the offensive line.</dd>
<dt>3-4 defense</dt>
<dd>a <a href="/wiki/Defensive_team" title="Defensive team" class="mw-redirect">defensive</a> formation with 3 <a href="/wiki/Lineman_(football)" title="Lineman (football)" class="mw-redirect">linemen</a> and 4 linebackers. A professional derivative in the 1970s of the earlier <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma" title="University of Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> or <b>"50" defense</b>, which had 5 linemen and 2 linebackers. The 3-4 outside linebackers resemble "stand-up ends" in the older defense.</dd>
<dt>4-3 defense</dt>
<dd>a defensive formation with 4 linemen and 3 linebackers. Several variations are employed. First used by coach <a href="/wiki/Joe_Kuharich" title="Joe Kuharich">Joe Kuharich</a><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Tom_Landry" title="Tom Landry">Tom Landry</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
<dt>4-4-4 Defense</dt>
<dd>Illegal participation (name so derived from the fact that 4+4+4=12 men on the field; each team is limited to 11). Coined by coach and color commentator <a href="/wiki/John_Madden_(football)" title="John Madden (football)" class="mw-redirect">John Madden</a>. (However, this formation is legal in Canadian football, as there are 12 players on the Field)</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/46_defense" title="46 defense">46 defense</a></dt>
<dd>(pronounced <i>forty-six defense</i>) a formation of the 4-3 defense (four linemen and three linebackers) in which three defensive backs (the two cornerbacks and the strong safety) crowd the line of scrimmage. The remaining safety, which is the free safety, stays in the backfield. It was invented by <a href="/wiki/Buddy_Ryan" title="Buddy Ryan">Buddy Ryan</a> while with the Chicago Bears and popularized by the <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XX" title="Super Bowl XX">Super Bowl XX Champion</a> 1985 Chicago Bears.</dd>
<dt>50 defense</dt>
<dd>a once popular college defense with 5 defensive linemen and 2 linebackers. Also known as the "Oklahoma Defense," it is structurally very similar to the 3-4. In the 50-defense, the team uses a nose tackle (NT), 2 defensive tackles(DTs) lined up over or slightly inside the offensive tackles(OTs), and 2 defensive ends (DEs) lineup over or outside the tight end (TE). It maximizes size along the line of scrimmage and is mostly used only in high school against teams that run the ball a lot.</dd>

<dl>
<dt><a href="/wiki/A-11_offense" title="A-11 offense">A-11 offense</a></dt>
<dd>an offensive philosophy designed to appear as if all 11 players are eligible receivers. The offense exploits a loophole in the American football rulebook to technically make the formation a <a href="/w/index.php?title=Scrimmage_kick&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Scrimmage kick (page does not exist)">scrimmage kick</a>, and the offensive line is spread across the field, all wearing numbers of eligible receivers, in an effort to confuse and deceive the defense. It was banned in 2009.</dd>
<dt>Air Raid</dt>
<dd>an offensive philosophy derived from the <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_Offense" title="West Coast Offense" class="mw-redirect">West Coast Offense</a> but adapted to the shotgun formation. In this offense the running game is heavily de-emphasized while the quick pass, medium pass, and screen game are highly developed.</dd>
<dt><a href="/w/index.php?title=Air_Yards&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Air Yards (page does not exist)">Air Yards</a></dt>
<dd>the yards gained by a pass through the air. It is the distance gained by a pass forward of the line of scrimmage to the spot of the reception. Alternatively, it is the total passing yards minus the yards run after catch (RAC).</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/All-purpose_yardage" title="All-purpose yardage">all-purpose yardage</a></dt>
<dd>the sum of all yards gained by a player who is in possession of the ball during a play. This includes rushing and receiving yards gained on offense, yards gained on returns of interceptions and fumbles, and yards gained on kickoff and punt returns.</dd>
<dt>audible</dt>
<dd>a play called by the quarterback at the line of scrimmage to make a change from the play that was called in the huddle.</dd>
<dt>automatic first down</dt>
<dd>for several of the most severe fouls against the defensive team, a first down is awarded to the offensive team even if the result of the penalty does not advance the ball beyond the line to gain. In the NFL and NCAA, the fouls include pass interference and all personal fouls. Under NFHS (High School) rules only roughing the snapper, holder, kicker, or passer and forward pass interference by the defense are penalized with an automatic first down.</dd>

<dt><a href="/wiki/Blitz_(American_football)" title="Blitz (American football)">blitz</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>a defensive maneuver in which one or more linebackers or defensive backs, who normally remain behind the line of scrimmage, instead charge into the opponents' backfield. However, in the 3-4 defense, one linebacker typically rushes the passer with the three down linemen. This is not considered a blitz. If an additional linebacker is sent, bringing the total number of rushers to five, it is a blitz.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Blocking_(American_football)" title="Blocking (American football)">blocking</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>when a player obstructs another player's path with his body. Examples: Cut block, Zone block, Trap block, Pull block, Screen block, Pass block, Double-team block.</dd>

<dt><a href="/wiki/Bootleg_play" title="Bootleg play">bootleg</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>an offensive play predicated upon misdirection in which the quarterback pretends to hand the ball to another player, and then carries the ball in the opposite direction of the supposed ballcarrier with the intent of either passing or running (sometimes the quarterback has the option of doing either). A <b>naked bootleg</b> is a risky variation of this play when the quarterback has no blockers pulling out with him. Contrast with <b>scramble</b>, <b>sneak</b>, and <b>draw</b>.</dd>
<dt>the box</dt>
<dd>an area on the defensive side of the ball, directly opposite the offensive linemen and about 5 yards deep; having 8 players in the box means bringing in a defensive back, normally the strong safety, to help stop the offensive team's running game</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Bust" title="Bust">bust</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>term often used to refer to a player, usually one drafted in the first day of the NFL Draft, who failed to meet the expectations of the drafting team.

<dt>buttonhook (hook,dig)</dt>
<dd>The buttonhook route is when a receiver runs straight upfield a certain distance and then plants hard and runs straight back towards the quarterback. Often simply called a hook route or a dig route. In some cases, a dig route is considered a very long buttonhook, such as 15+ yards downfield. Hence the receiver must dig his cleats in hard to stop and come back at the quarterback after running so far and fast.</dd>

<dt>center-eligible&#160;</dt>
<dd>a trick play; at the snap, the entire offensive line is to one side of the center so that he is on the end and therefore is an eligible receiver. A center-eligible play was featured in the film <i><a href="/wiki/MASH_(film)" title="MASH (film)">M*A*S*H</a></i>.</dd>
<dt>centre&#160;</dt>

<dt><a href="/wiki/Checkdown" title="Checkdown">checkdown</a></dt>
<dd>The checkdown pass is when the quarterback has to complete a short pass to a running back or tight end as a last resort to avoid a sack. Handling a checkdown situation is for a running back to catch these short pass, then use his speed, agility and power to run for extra yardage.</dd>
<dt>clipping&#160;</dt>
<dd>an illegal block in which the victim is blocked from the back and at or below the waist; the penalty is 15 yards. Originally, clipping was defined as any block from the back, but is now restricted to blocks at or below the waist. Other blocks from the back are now punished with 10-yard penalties.</dd>
<dt>coffin corner</dt>
<dd>the corner of the field of play. A punter, if he is close enough, will often attempt to kick the ball out of bounds close to the receiving team's goal line and pin them back near their own end zone.</dd>
<dt>comeback route</dt>
<dd>a receiver or tight end route where the player runs straight upfield a specified number of yards (could be a short or medium route), plants hard, and turns and runs back towards the sideline at a 45 degree angle. Often confusingly named, a wide receiver doesn't come back towards the quarterback, instead he tries to catch the ball and guarantee getting out of bounds.</dd>
<dt>completion percentage</dt>
<dd><a href="/wiki/Percentage" title="Percentage">percentage</a> of passing accuracy. Passes Attempted divided by passes completed.</dd>
<dt>contain&#160;</dt>
<dd>a defensive assignment. On outside runs such as the sweep, one defensive player (usually a <a href="/wiki/Cornerback" title="Cornerback">cornerback</a> or outside linebacker) is assigned to keep the rusher from getting to the edge of the play and turning upfield. If executed properly, the rusher will have to turn upfield before the play calls for it, giving the linebackers a better chance of stopping the play for little or no gain.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Cornerback" title="Cornerback">cornerback</a> (CB)</dt>
<dd>a <a href="/wiki/Defensive_back" title="Defensive back">defensive back</a> who lines up near the line of scrimmage across from a <b>wide receiver</b>. Their primary job is to disrupt passing routes and to defend against short and medium passes in the passing game, and to contain the rusher on rushing plays.</dd>

<dd>There are two general schemes for defending against the pass:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Man-to-man, where each eligible receiver is covered by a defensive back or a linebacker.</li>
<li>Zone, where certain players (usually defensive backs and/or linebackers, though occasionally linemen as well) are assigned an area on the field (Flat, Hook, Curl and Deep) that they are to cover.</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Common types of coverage:</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Cover Zero - Strict man-to-man coverage with no help from safeties (usually a blitz play with at least five men crossing the line of scrimmage)</li>
<li>Cover One - Man-to-man coverage with at least one safety not assigned a player to cover who can help out on deep pass routes.</li>
<li>Cover Two - Zone coverage with the safeties playing deep and covering half the field each. Can be Cover 2 man, where every receiver is covered by a defensive player, or Cover 2 Zone (also known as Tampa 2), where CB covers Flat zone, OLB Hook Zone and MLB Curl Zone.</li>
<li>Cover Three - Zone coverage as above, but with extra help from Strong Safety/Cornerback, so that each player covers one-third of a deep zone.</li>
<li>Cover Four - As above, with the corners and safeties dropping into deep coverage, with each taking one-fourth of the width of the field. Also referred to as Quarters.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>counter</dt>
<dd>a running play in which the running back will take a step in the apparent direction of the play (i.e., the direction the line is moving), only to get the handoff in the other direction. <b>Weak side</b> linemen will sometimes <b>pull</b> and lead the back downfield (sometimes called a <b>counter trap</b>), but not necessarily. The play is designed to get the defense to flow away from the action for a few steps as they follow the linemen, allowing more room for the running back.</dd>
<dt>crackback block</dt>
<dd>an illegal block delivered below the opponent's waist by an offensive player who had left the area of close line play and then returned to it, or was not within it at the snap. The term is also used to describe a legal block (delivered from the front, or from the side with the offensive player's helmet in front of the blocked player) by a wide receiver on a player who lined up inside of him.</dd>
<dt>cut</dt>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>a sharp change of direction by a running player. Also called a <a href="/wiki/Cutback_(football_move)" title="Cutback (football move)">cutback</a>.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>cut blocking</dt>
<dd>a blocking technique in which offensive linemen, and sometimes other blockers, block legally below the waist (i.e., from the front of the defensive player) in an attempt to bring the defenders to ground, making them unable to pursue a running back for the short time needed for the back to find a gap in the defense. The technique is somewhat controversial, as it carries a risk of serious leg injuries to the blocked defenders.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> of the 1980s and early 90's were noted for their cut-blocking (and leg-whipping, which is illegal), a tactic that was later adopted in mid-90's by the <a href="/wiki/NFL" title="NFL" class="mw-redirect">NFL</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Denver_Broncos" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>. The Broncos gained a degree of notoriety for their cut-blocking techniques (often called "dirty" play by their opponents) which produced the NFL's best rushing attack for a decade, but also resulted in several defensive players opponents of the Broncos being injured by cut blocks. In a <a href="/wiki/Monday_Night_Football" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a> game in 2004, defensive lineman Anthony Williams of the <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals" title="Cincinnati Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a> was lost to the season on a block (by the Broncos tackle George Foster), and in 2005, <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars" title="Jacksonville Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> defensive lineman <a href="/wiki/Paul_Spicer" title="Paul Spicer">Paul Spicer</a> was badly injured on block by Broncos tackle <a href="/wiki/Matt_Lepsis" title="Matt Lepsis">Matt Lepsis</a>. Responding to the criticism, in 2004 Broncos coach <a href="/wiki/Mike_Shanahan" title="Mike Shanahan">Mike Shanahan</a> showed local reporters some NFL game film (only seen and used by coaches) that demonstrated how nearly every team in the NFL uses cut-blocking.</dd>

<dt><a href="/wiki/Formation_(American_football)" title="Formation (American football)">formation</a>&#160;</dt>
<dd>An arrangement of the offensive skill players. A formation usually is described in terms of how the running backs line up (e.g. <a href="/wiki/I_formation" title="I formation">I formation</a>, which refers to the half back is lined up about 7 yard deep, and the fullback is lined up about 5 yards deep, both directly behind the quarterback) or how the wide receivers line up (e.g. Trips left, in which three wide receivers line up to the left of the linemen). Frequently, the formation will allude to both, such as with Strong I Slot Right, in which the halfback is lined up 7 yards deep behind the quarterback, the fullback is 5 yards deep behind the guard or tackle on the strong side, and both wide receivers are lined up on the right side of the offensive line. There are rules limiting what is legal in a formation. All five offensive linemen must be on the line of scrimmage (a small amount of leeway is given to tackles when lined up for pass protection). Also, there must be one receiver (usually one tight end and one wide receiver) lined up on the line on either side of the offensive linemen (it doesn't matter how close they are to the tackles, as long as they are on the line), with a total of no fewer than seven players on the line, 5 of which must be numbered between 50-79. A numbering exception exists if the offense is in a scrimmage kick formation which allows a player whose number is 1-49 or 80-99 to take the place of a lineman numbered 50-79. A receiver who is on the line may not go in motion.</dd>

<dt>fourth down</dt>
<dd>The final of a set of four downs. Unless a first down is achieved or a penalty forces a replay of the down, the team will lose control of the ball after this play. If a team does not think they can get a first down, they often punt on fourth down or kick a field goal if they are close enough to do so.</dd>
<dt>fourth down conversion</dt>
<dd>The act of using a fourth down play to make a first down. These are comparatively uncommon. If a team is close enough, they will generally attempt a field goal on fourth down. Otherwise, they will usually punt. However, the coach may elect to try to get a new first down. This is more likely if the amount of yardage needed for the conversion is small, or if the team is trailing by a significant amount (likelihood of such a try increasing as it gets later in the game).</dd>

However, if the defense does not go offside, the offense will take a five-yard penalty for delay of game and punt the ball away</dd>
<dt>hash marks</dt>
<dd>lines between which the ball begins each play. The lines are parallel to and a distance in from the side lines and marked as broken lines. If a play is blown dead while the ball is between the hash marks, the ball is spotted where it is blown dead for the following play. If the play ends outside the hash marks, the ball is spotted at the nearer hash mark.</dd>

<dd>a player who holds the ball upright for a place kick. Often backup quarterbacks are used for their superior ball-handling ability and in the event of a bad snap requiring a pass play, or punters for their ability to catch long snaps.</dd>
<dt>holding</dt>
<dd>there are two kinds of holding: offensive holding, illegally blocking a player from the opposing team by grabbing and holding his uniform or body; and defensive holding, called against defensive players who hold offensive players, but who are not actively making an attempt to catch the ball (if the defensive player were to impede an offensive player in the act of catching the ball, that would be the more severe foul of pass interference)</dd>
<dt>Home and away</dt>
<dd>a method of scheduling opponents, such that the two teams play one game at each team's home stadium. In college football, conferences such as the Big12, where a team does not play all the other teams each year, use a "home and away" schedule to play an opponent two years in a row and then rotate to another opponent. Teams also use this method to schedule non-conference opponents of roughly equal skill so that ticket revenue is split evenly. When scheduling teams of a lower calibre, the higher-rated team usually plays at home and provides a cash payout to the other team.</dd>
<dt><a href="/wiki/Hook_and_lateral" title="Hook and lateral">hook and lateral</a> (hook and ladder)</dt>
<dd>a trick play in which a receiver (usually a wide receiver) runs a hook pattern (i.e., moving toward the line of scrimmage to make a catch), and then laterals the ball to a second player (generally another receiver or a running back) going in a different direction. One of the most famous uses of this play was by <a href="/wiki/2006_Boise_State_Broncos_football_team" title="2006 Boise State Broncos football team">Boise State</a> in its epic <a href="/wiki/2007_Fiesta_Bowl" title="2007 Fiesta Bowl">2007 Fiesta Bowl</a> win over <a href="/wiki/2006_Oklahoma_Sooners_football_team" title="2006 Oklahoma Sooners football team">Oklahoma</a>.</dd>

<dd>A formation that includes a <b>fullback</b> and <b>tailback</b> lined up with the fullback directly in front of the tailback.

<dt>illegal formation</dt>
<dd>On offense, there must be exactly seven players lined up on the line of scrimmage for at least one count before the ball is snapped. If not, then it is an illegal formation.</dd>
<dt>illegal motion</dt>
<dd>On offense, a player may be in motion but cannot be going forward at the time of the snap (except in Arena football where one player is allowed to do so), and a lineman must be set for one second before the snap. Otherwise it is an illegal motion.</dd>

<dt>indirect snap</dt>
<dd>a play in which the ball is handed to the quarterback rather than thrown directly to the ballcarrier by the center as in a <i>direct snap</i> play. So named because the quarterback acts as an intermediary in relaying the ball to the ballcarrier. Also used to refer to formations that use such a snap, as most modern formations do. Indirect snap formations exploded in popularity after World War II.</dd>
<dt>ineligible receiver</dt>
<dd>Certain players on the offense are not allowed to catch passes. For example, in most situations offensive linemen cannot be receivers and they may cause their team to be penalized if they catch the ball. An exception is if the ball has already been tipped by a different player. In <a href="/wiki/Six-man_football" title="Six-man football">six-man football</a> all players are eligible receivers.</dd>
<dt>inside</dt>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>of a player's path: relatively close (in reference to the sides of the field) to where the ball was snapped from. Thus, a ballcarrier's path in crossing the neutral zone may be said to be "inside" of an opponent, or an "inside run" in general, and a rushing defensive player may be said to put on an "inside move" or "inside rush".</li>
<li>of the movement of the ball between players: directed toward a player who cuts between a player in the backfield who throws or hands the ball and the place from which it was snapped. Thus, an "inside pass" or "inside handoff". An "inside reverse" (sometimes called a scissors play) is a reverse play via an inside handoff.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>intentional grounding</dt>
<dd>A type of illegal forward pass; thrown without an intended receiver and no chance of completion to any offensive player, for the sole purpose of conserving time or loss of yardage. This foul costs the offense a loss of down and 10 yards. If it occurs 10 yards behind the line of scrimmage, then the 10 yards is taken from the spot of the foul. If the foul is committed in the end zone the penalty is a safety. Intentional grounding is not called in the case of a <b>spike</b> after a hand to hand snap or if under NFL or NCAA rules, the quarterback was outside the <b>tackle box,</b> (the imaginary area between each tackle) at the time of the pass, provided that the ball travels at least to the line of scrimmage. The <b>Tackle Box</b> is also known as the Pocket. <a href="http://www.nfl.com/fans/rules/intentionalgrounding" class="external text" title="http://www.nfl.com/fans/rules/intentionalgrounding" rel="nofollow">nfl rules</a></dd>

<dt>max protect</dt>
<dd>a modification used on pass plays (usually combined with a shotgun formation) which keeps the tight end and both backs in behind the line of scrimmage to pass protect rather than run a pass route. This is used in obvious blitzing situations to give the quarterback "maximum protection" in the pocket. Although good for holding off a blitz, it leaves the quarterback with only two receivers to throw to (and therefore only two players for the secondary to defend). Some of the logic behind this play might stem from a player's supposed lack of defensibility: when a receiver (such as <a href="/wiki/Randy_Moss" title="Randy Moss">Randy Moss</a>) or quarterback-receiver duo (such as the historic <a href="/wiki/Joe_Montana" title="Joe Montana">Joe Montana</a>-and-<a href="/wiki/Jerry_Rice" title="Jerry Rice">Jerry Rice</a>) is of the caliber that a completion is likely even when the receiver is closely guarded by defenders.

Running a spike play presumes there will be at least one play by the same team immediately afterward; occasionally there is so little time left in the half or game that a quarterback whose first choice was to spike the ball may have to run a regular play instead, because the spike would run the clock out. There is at least one case of a quarterback in the NFL doing just that, although that quarterback's regular play failed.

<dt><a href="/wiki/Tight_end" title="Tight end">tight end</a> <b>(TE)</b></dt>
<dd>a player position on <a href="/wiki/Offensive_team" title="Offensive team" class="mw-redirect">offense</a>, often known as <b>Y</b> receiver, lines up on the line of scrimmage, next to the offensive tackle.

<dt><b>time of possession</b></dt>
<dd>the amount of time one team has the ball in its possession relative to the other team. Since there are 60 minutes in a non-overtime game, and one team or another always has possession of the ball, the two teams divide up the time with which they have the ball out of the 60 minutes. If one team has it 40 minutes the other will have it 20 and so forth. A time of possession advantage is seen as a positive thing and is highly correlative with a win or loss. Teams that dominate time of possession usually have good defenses (that can keep the opposing team's offense from mounting many long drives) and solid offenses (usually with good running games as running plays keep the clock running more often than passing plays).</dd>

<dt><a href="/wiki/Touchback" title="Touchback">touchback</a></dt>
<dd>the act of downing the ball behind one's own goal line on a kickoff or punt after the ball had been propelled over the goal by the opposing team. This can be accomplished by one of several ways: the receiving team player catching the ball in the endzone and dropping down to one knee; by the ball touching any part of the endzone; the ball carrying out of the endzone in any way without being possessed by either team. After a touchback, the team that downed it gets the ball at their own 20-yard line.</dd>
<dt>touchdown</dt>
<dd>a play worth six points, accomplished by gaining legal possession of the ball in the opponent's end zone or by the ball crossing the plane of the opponent's goal line with legal possession by a player.

<dt>trick play</dt>
<dd>Any of a variety of plays that use deception to catch the other team offguard. Famous trick plays include the fake punt (kick), "Statue of Liberty", flea-flicker, center-eligible, surprise on-side kick and halfback pass plays. These plays are often dangerous, as most upper level teams have too much skill and experience to be fooled for long.</dd>
<dt>trips</dt>
<dd>a formation in which 3 wide receivers are lined up on the same side of the field, with one on the LOS and usually the others flanking the WR one yard off the LOS (as in Slot or Wing, though only one yard off the WR, each way.</dd>

<dd>A try is a scrimmage down which is neither timed nor numbered, awarded to a team who has just scored a 6 point touchdown, from close to their opponent's goal line (2-yard line in the NFL, 3 yard line NCAA &amp; NFHS). The try allows the offense (and in some codes, the defense) to score an additional 1 or 2 points. Also called "try-for-point", "conversion", "convert" (Canadian), "extra point(s)", "point(s) after (touchdown)" or PAT.</dd>

The basis of Walsh's offense is to use short routes for receivers, delivering the ball on time and accurately and using short passes to replace runs.

<p><b>Harvey Bernard Milk</b> (May 22, 1930 – November 27, 1978) was an American politician and <a href="/wiki/List_of_gay,_lesbian_or_bisexual_firsts" title="List of gay, lesbian or bisexual firsts" class="mw-redirect">the first</a> openly <a href="/wiki/Homosexual_orientation" title="Homosexual orientation" class="mw-redirect">gay</a> man to be elected to public office in California, as a member of the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors" title="San Francisco Board of Supervisors">San Francisco Board of Supervisors</a>. Politics and gay activism were not Milk's early interests; he did not feel the need to be open about his <a href="/wiki/Homosexuality" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> or participate in civic matters until around age 40, after his experiences in the <a href="/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s" title="Counterculture of the 1960s">counterculture of the 1960s</a>.</p>
<p>Milk moved from <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> to settle in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> in 1972 amid a migration of gay men moving to the <a href="/wiki/The_Castro,_San_Francisco,_California" title="The Castro, San Francisco, California">Castro District</a> in the 1970s. He took advantage of the growing political and economic power of the neighborhood to promote his interests, and ran unsuccessfully for political office three times. His theatrical campaigns earned him increasing popularity, and Milk won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977, a result of the broader social changes the city was experiencing.</p>
<p>Milk served 11 months in office and was responsible for passing a stringent gay rights ordinance for the city. On November 27, 1978, Milk and Mayor <a href="/wiki/George_Moscone" title="George Moscone">George Moscone</a> were <a href="/wiki/Moscone%E2%80%93Milk_assassinations" title="Moscone–Milk assassinations">assassinated</a> by <a href="/wiki/Dan_White" title="Dan White">Dan White</a>, another city supervisor who had recently resigned but wanted his job back. Conflicts between liberal trends that were responsible for Milk's election and conservative resistance to those changes were evident in events following the assassinations.</p>
<p>Despite his short career in politics, Milk has become an icon in San Francisco and "a martyr for gay rights", according to <a href="/wiki/University_of_San_Francisco" title="University of San Francisco">University of San Francisco</a> professor Peter Novak.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> In 2002, Milk was called "the most famous and most significantly open <a href="/wiki/LGBT" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> official ever elected in the United States".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Anne_Kronenberg" title="Anne Kronenberg">Anne Kronenberg</a>, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: "What set Harvey apart from you or me was that he was a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

He was the younger son of <a href="/wiki/Lithuanian_Jews" title="Lithuanian Jews">Lithuanian Jewish</a> parents and the grandson of a salesman, Morris Milk, who owned a department store<sup id="cite_ref-scribner_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-scribner-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ewb_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ewb-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> and helped to organize the first synagogue in the area.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> As a child, Milk was teased for his protruding ears, big nose, and oversized feet, and tended to grab attention as a class clown. He played football in school, and developed a passion for opera; in his teens, he acknowledged his homosexuality, but kept it a guarded secret. Under his name in the high school yearbook, it read, "Glimpy Milk—and they say WOMEN are never at a loss for words".<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

He wrote for the college newspaper and earned a reputation as a gregarious, friendly student. None of his friends in high school or college suspected that he was gay. As one classmate remembered, "He was never thought of as a possible <a href="/wiki/Queer" title="Queer">queer</a>—that's what you called them then—he was a man's man".<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Milk's early career was marked by frequent changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at <a href="/wiki/George_W._Hewlett_High_School" title="George W. Hewlett High School">George W. Hewlett High School</a> on <a href="/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a>.

Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after they moved in together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Quickly growing bored, they decided to move to <a href="/wiki/Dallas" title="Dallas">Dallas</a>, <a href="/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm.<sup id="cite_ref-alch_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-alch-10" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.</p>
<p>Milk tried to separate his early romantic life from his family and work.

In 1962 Milk became involved with <a href="/wiki/Craig_Rodwell" title="Craig Rodwell">Craig Rodwell</a>, who was ten years younger. Though Milk courted Rodwell ardently, waking him every morning with a call and sending him notes, Milk was discouraged by Rodwell's involvement with the New York <a href="/wiki/Mattachine_Society" title="Mattachine Society">Mattachine Society</a>, a gay activist organization. When Rodwell was arrested for walking in Riis Park, charged with inciting a riot and with indecent exposure (the law required men's swimsuits to extend from above the navel to below the thigh), he spent three days in jail. The relationship soon ended as Milk became alarmed at Rodwell's tendency to agitate the police.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

Facing eviction if caught having homosexual sex in a rented apartment, and unwilling to face arrest in gay bars, some men turned to having sex in public parks at night. Mayor Alioto asked the police to target the parks, hoping the decision would appeal to the Archdiocese and his Catholic supporters. In 1971, 2,800&#160;gay men were arrested for public sex in San Francisco.

<p>Milk's reception by the gay political establishment in San Francisco was icy. Jim Foster, who had by then been active in gay politics for ten years, resented the newcomer's asking for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor.

<p>Keeping his promise to Milk, newly elected Mayor George Moscone appointed him to the Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking a position in the <a href="/wiki/California_State_Assembly" title="California State Assembly">California State Assembly</a>. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted.

<p>Milk spent five weeks on the Board of Permit Appeals before Moscone was forced to fire him when he announced he would run for the California State Assembly. Rick Stokes replaced him. Milk's firing, and the backroom deal made between Moscone, the assembly speaker, and Agnos, fueled his campaign as he took on the identity of a political underdog.<sup id="cite_ref-shiltsmachine_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shiltsmachine-51" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> He railed that high officers in the city and state governments were against him.

<p>Milk's role as a representative of San Francisco's gay community expanded during this period. On September 22, 1975, President <a href="/wiki/Gerald_Ford" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a> was visiting San Francisco, walking from his hotel to his car.

Sipple refused to call himself a hero and did not want his sexuality disclosed. Milk, however, took advantage of the opportunity to illustrate his cause that public perception of gay people would be improved if they came out of the closet. He told a friend: "It's too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that ca-ca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms."<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" title=""><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> Milk contacted a newspaper.<sup id="cite_ref-latimes2.2F13.2F89_56-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-latimes2.2F13.2F89-56" title=""><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Milk's continuing campaign, run from the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although volunteers were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers.

Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned with the man who was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.<sup id="cite_ref-shiltsmachine_51-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shiltsmachine-51" title=""><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Anita Bryant's public campaign opposing homosexuality and the multiple challenges to gay rights ordinances across the United States fueled gay politics in San Francisco. Seventeen candidates from the Castro District entered the next race for supervisor; more than half of them were gay. <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> ran an exposé on the veritable invasion of gay people into San Francisco, estimating that the city's gay population was between 100,000 and 200,000 out of a total 750,000.<sup id="cite_ref-Gold11.2F6.2F77_79-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gold11.2F6.2F77-79" title=""><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup> The Castro Village Association had grown to 90&#160;businesses; the local bank, formerly the smallest branch in the city, had become the largest and was forced to build a wing to accommodate its new customers.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80" title=""><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup> Milk biographer Randy Shilts noted that "broader historical forces" were fueling his campaign.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81" title=""><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Milk's most successful opponent was the quiet and thoughtful lawyer Rick Stokes, who was backed by the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club. Stokes had been open about his homosexuality long before Milk had, and had experienced more severe treatment, once hospitalized and forced to endure <a href="/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy" title="Electroconvulsive therapy">electroshock therapy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82" title=""><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup> Milk, however, was more expressive about the role of gay people and their issues in San Francisco politics. Stokes was quoted saying, "I'm just a businessman who happens to be gay", and expressed the view that any normal person could also be homosexual. Milk's contrasting populist philosophy was relayed to <i>The New York Times</i>: "We don't want sympathetic liberals, we want gays to represent gays ... I represent the gay street people—the 14-year-old runaway from <a href="/wiki/San_Antonio" title="San Antonio">San Antonio</a>. We have to make up for hundreds of years of persecution.

This time, even <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i> endorsed him for supervisor.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83" title=""><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup> He won by 30% against sixteen other candidates, and after his victory became apparent, he arrived on Castro Street on the back of his campaign manager's motorcycle—escorted by Sheriff <a href="/wiki/Richard_Hongisto" title="Richard Hongisto">Richard Hongisto</a>—to what a newspaper story described as a "tumultuous and moving welcome".<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84" title=""><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Milk's energy, affinity for pranking, and his unpredictability at times exasperated Board of Supervisors President Dianne Feinstein. In his first meeting with Mayor Moscone, Milk called himself the "number one queen" and dictated to Moscone that he would have to go through Milk instead of the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club if he wanted the city's gay votes—a quarter of San Francisco's voting population.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94" title=""><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></a></sup> Milk, however, became Moscone's closest ally on the Board of Supervisors.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95" title=""><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></a></sup> The biggest targets of Milk's ire were large corporations and real estate developers.

Initially he agreed with fellow Supervisor Dan White, whose district was located two miles south of the Castro, that a mental health facility for troubled adolescents should not be placed there in an old convent. However, after Milk learned more about the facility, he decided to switch his vote, ensuring that White would lose his cause—one he had championed while campaigning. White did not forget it. He opposed every initiative and issue Milk supported.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97" title=""><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Milk began his tenure by sponsoring a civil rights bill that outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation. The ordinance was called the "most stringent and encompassing in the nation", and its passing demonstrated "the growing political power of homosexuals", according to <i>The New York Times</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98" title=""><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup> Only Supervisor White voted against it; Mayor Moscone enthusiastically signed it into law with a light blue pen that Milk had given him for the occasion.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99" title=""><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The second bill Milk concentrated on was designed to solve the number one problem according to a recent citywide poll: dog excrement. Within a month of being sworn in, he began to work on a city ordinance to require dog owners to scoop their pets' feces. Dubbed the "pooper scooper law", its authorization by the Board of Supervisors was covered extensively by television and newspapers in San Francisco. Anne Kronenberg, Milk's campaign manager, called him "a master at figuring out what would get him covered in the newspaper".<sup id="cite_ref-timesdoc_100-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-timesdoc-100" title=""><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> He invited the press to <a href="/wiki/Duboce_Park" title="Duboce Park">Duboce Park</a> to explain why it was necessary, and while cameras were rolling, stepped in the offending substance apparently by mistake.

<p>John Briggs was forced to drop out of the 1978 race for California governor, but received enthusiastic support for Proposition 6, dubbed the <a href="/wiki/Briggs_Initiative" title="Briggs Initiative">Briggs Initiative</a>. The proposed law would have made firing gay teachers—and any public school employees who supported gay rights—mandatory. Briggs' messages supporting Proposition 6 were pervasive throughout California, and Harvey Milk attended every event Briggs hosted.

Milk responded with statistics compiled by law enforcement that provided evidence that <a href="/wiki/Pedophile" title="Pedophile" class="mw-redirect">pedophiles</a> identified primarily as heterosexual, and dismissed Briggs' points with one-liner jokes: "If it were true that children mimicked their teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around".<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-105" title=""><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Dan White's arrest and trial caused a sensation, and illustrated severe tensions between the liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration, as well as the liberal direction of the city government.

<p>After the verdict, the District Attorney Joseph Freitas faced a furious gay community to explain what had gone wrong. The prosecutor admitted to feeling sorry for White before the trial, and neglected to ask the interrogator who recorded White's confession (and who was a childhood friend of White's and his police softball team coach) about his biases and the support White received from the police because, he said, he did not want to embarrass the detective in front of his family in court.<sup id="cite_ref-hinckle49_138-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hinckle49-138" title=""><span>[</span>131<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-148" title=""><span>[</span>141<span>]</span></a></sup> Nor did Freitas question White's frame of mind, lack of a history of mental illness, or bring into evidence city politics, suggesting that revenge may have been a motive.

<p>Milk's and Moscone's murders and White's trial changed city politics and the California legal system. In 1980 San Francisco ended district supervisor elections, fearing that a Board of Supervisors so divisive would be harmful to the city, and that they had been a factor in the assassinations. A grassroots neighborhood effort to restore district elections in the mid-1990s proved successful, and the city returned to neighborhood representatives in 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150" title=""><span>[</span>143<span>]</span></a></sup> As a result of Dan White's trial, California voters changed the law to reduce the likelihood of acquittals of accused who knew what they were doing but claimed their capacity was impaired.<sup id="cite_ref-mounts_140-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mounts-140" title=""><span>[</span>133<span>]</span></a></sup> Diminished capacity was abolished as a defense to a charge, but courts allowed evidence of it when deciding whether to incarcerate, commit, or otherwise punish a convicted defendant.<sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151" title=""><span>[</span>144<span>]</span></a></sup> The "Twinkie defense" has entered American mythology, popularly described as a case where a murderer escapes justice because he binged on junk food, simplifying White's lack of political savvy, his relationships with George Moscone and Harvey Milk, and what <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> columnist <a href="/wiki/Herb_Caen" title="Herb Caen">Herb Caen</a> described as pandemic police "dislike of homosexuals".<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152" title=""><span>[</span>145<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Dan White served a little more than five years for the double murder of Moscone and Milk.

<p>Harvey Milk's political career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, and the importance of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy.<sup id="cite_ref-foss_154-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-foss-154" title=""><span>[</span>147<span>]</span></a></sup> His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide the fact that he was gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.<sup id="cite_ref-foss_154-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-foss-154" title=""><span>[</span>147<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Milk strongly believed that neighborhoods promoted unity and a small-town experience, and that the Castro should provide services to all its residents. He opposed the closing of an elementary school; even though most gay people in the Castro did not have children, Milk saw his neighborhood having the potential to welcome everyone. He told his aides to concentrate on fixing <a href="/wiki/Pothole" title="Pothole">potholes</a>, and boasted that 50 new stop signs had been installed in District 5.<sup id="cite_ref-foss_154-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-foss-154" title=""><span>[</span>147<span>]</span></a></sup> Responding to city residents' largest complaint about living in San Francisco—dog feces—Milk made it a priority to enact the ordinance requiring dog owners to take care of their pets' droppings. Randy Shilts noted, "some would claim Harvey was a socialist or various other sorts of ideologues, but, in reality, Harvey's political philosophy was never more complicated than the issue of dogshit; government should solve people's basic problems."<sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-155" title=""><span>[</span>148<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Karen Foss, a communications professor at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_New_Mexico" title="University of New Mexico">University of New Mexico</a>, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics to the fact that he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose ... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies."<sup id="cite_ref-fossqueer_156-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-fossqueer-156" title=""><span>[</span>149<span>]</span></a></sup> Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor.<sup id="cite_ref-demilio_18-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-demilio-18" title=""><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> His most famous talking points became known as the "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if you help elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.<sup id="cite_ref-157" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-157" title=""><span>[</span>150<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last year of his life, Milk emphasized that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and <a href="/wiki/Violence_against_LGBT_people" title="Violence against LGBT people">violence against them</a>. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects ... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.<sup id="cite_ref-giteck_87-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-giteck-87" title=""><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Milk's assassination has become entwined with his political efficacy, partly because he was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death."<sup id="cite_ref-miller408_133-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-miller408-133" title=""><span>[</span>126<span>]</span></a></sup> His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America".<sup id="cite_ref-shilts348_158-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shilts348-158" title=""><span>[</span>151<span>]</span></a></sup> According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend has been unable to be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him a great deal of the Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one."<sup id="cite_ref-castroII_159-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-castroII-159" title=""><span>[</span>152<span>]</span></a></sup> On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian <a href="/wiki/John_D%27Emilio" title="John D'Emilio">John D'Emilio</a> said, "The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity."<sup id="cite_ref-cloud20_160-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cloud20-160" title=""><span>[</span>153<span>]</span></a></sup> For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process."<sup id="cite_ref-cloud20_160-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cloud20-160" title=""><span>[</span>153<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<li id="cite_note-8"><b><a href="#cite_ref-8" title="">^</a></b> Milk said numerous times that he was discharged from the Navy because he was gay, but Randy Shilts was skeptical of this claim, stating: "The Harvey Milk of this era was no political activist, and according to available evidence, he played the more typical balancing act between discretion and his sex drive." (p. 16) Scholar Karen Foss confirms his discharge from the Navy had no connection to his sexuality and states, "While exaggeration is a frequent campaign tactic, in Milk's case such embellishments served to demonstrate his willingness to be part of the political system while also maintain his distance from it." (See citations list for <i>Queer Words, Queer Images</i>, p. 21.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-47"><b><a href="#cite_ref-47" title="">^</a></b> Gain further alienated the SFPD by attending a raucous party in 1977 called the Hooker's Ball. The party grew out of control and Gain had to call in reinforcements to control the excesses, but a photograph ran in the papers of him holding a champagne bottle standing beside <a href="/wiki/COYOTE" title="COYOTE">prostitution rights</a> activist <a href="/wiki/Margo_St._James" title="Margo St. James">Margo St. James</a> and a drag queen named "Wonder Whore". (Weiss, p. 137–138.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-58"><b><a href="#cite_ref-58" title="">^</a></b> Sipple's case was eventually rejected in 1984 in a California court of appeals. Sipple, who was wounded in the head in Vietnam, was also diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic. He held no ill will toward Milk however, and remained in contact with him. The incident brought him so much attention that, later in life while drinking, he would regret grabbing Moore's gun. Eventually Sipple regained contact with his mother and brother, but was rejected by his father. He kept the letter written by Gerald Ford, framed in his apartment, until he died of pneumonia in 1989. ("Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President's Life", <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, [February 13, 1989], p. 1.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-61"><b><a href="#cite_ref-61" title="">^</a></b> Milk's relationship with the Temple was similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to <i>The San Francisco Examiner</i>, Jones and his parishioners were a "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Jose Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [November 20, 1978]. "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", <i>The San Francisco Examiner</i>, p. C.) Although Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", <i>Time</i>, December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Carter" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> in 1978, (Coleman, Loren (2004)., <i>The Copycat Effect</i>, Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 68.), he and his aides deeply distrusted Jones. When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." (Shilts, p. 139.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-68"><b><a href="#cite_ref-68" title="">^</a></b> Bryant agreed to an interview with <i><a href="/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> magazine, in which she was quoted saying that the civil rights ordinance "would have made it mandatory that flaunting homosexuals be hired in both the public and parochial schools&#160;... If they're a legitimate minority, then so are nail biters, dieters, fat people, short people, and murderers." ("Playboy Interview: Anita Bryant", <i>Playboy</i>, (May 1978), p.&#160;73–96, 232–250.) Bryant would often break into her standard "<a href="/wiki/The_Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic" title="The Battle Hymn of the Republic">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>" while speaking during the campaign, called homosexuals "human garbage", and blamed the drought in California on their sins. (Clendinen, p.&#160;306.) As the special election drew near, a Florida state senator read the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Leviticus" title="Book of Leviticus" class="mw-redirect">Book of Leviticus</a> aloud to the senate, and the governor went on record against the civil rights ordinance. (Duberman, p. 320.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-90"><b><a href="#cite_ref-90" title="">^</a></b> Two gay politicians were already in office: lesbian Massachusetts State Representative <a href="/wiki/Elaine_Noble" title="Elaine Noble">Elaine Noble</a> and Minnesota State Senator <a href="/wiki/Allan_Spear" title="Allan Spear">Allan Spear</a>, who had come out after he had been elected and won re-election.</li>
<li id="cite_note-111"><b><a href="#cite_ref-111" title="">^</a></b> Despite White's financial strain, he had recently voted against a pay raise for city supervisors that would have given him a $24,000 annual salary. (Cone, Russ [November 14, 1978]. "Increase in City Supervisors' Pay Is Proposed Again", <i>The San Francisco Examiner</i>, p. 4.) Feinstein noticed White's financial straits and pointed him toward commercial developers at <a href="/wiki/Pier_39" title="Pier 39">Pier 39</a> near <a href="/wiki/Fisherman%27s_Wharf,_San_Francisco,_California" title="Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco, California">Fisherman's Wharf</a> where he and his wife set up a walk-up restaurant called The Hot Potato. (Weiss, p. 143–146.) <a href="/wiki/Gentrification" title="Gentrification">Gentrification</a> in the Castro District was fully apparent in the late 1970s. In Milk's public rants about "bloodsucking" real estate developers, he used his landlord (who was gay) as an example. Not amused, his landlord tripled the rent for the storefront and the apartment above where Milk lived. (Shilts, p. 227–228.)</li>
<li id="cite_note-120"><b><a href="#cite_ref-120" title="">^</a></b> Though Feinstein was known to carry a handgun in her purse, she became a proponent of gun control. In 1994, Senator Feinstein exchanged words with <a href="/wiki/National_Rifle_Association" title="National Rifle Association">National Rifle Association</a> member and senator from Idaho <a href="/wiki/Larry_Craig" title="Larry Craig">Larry Craig</a>, who suggested during a debate on banning <a href="/wiki/Assault_weapons" title="Assault weapons" class="mw-redirect">assault weapons</a> that "the gentlelady from California" should be "a little bit more familiar with firearms and their deadly characteristics." She reminded Craig that she indeed had experience with the results of firearms when she put her finger in a bullet hole in Milk's neck while searching for a pulse. (Faye, Fiore [April 24, 1995]. "Rematch on Weapons Ban Takes Shape in Congress Arms: Feinstein prepares to defend the prohibition on assault guns as GOP musters forces to repeal it", <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, pg. 3.)</li>

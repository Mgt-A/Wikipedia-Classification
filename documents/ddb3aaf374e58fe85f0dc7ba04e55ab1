			<p>This is a <b>list of keywords</b> in the trading card game <i><b><a href="/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering" title="Magic: The Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></b></i>. A <b>keyword</b> in <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> is a word or phrase (usually one or two words) appearing on a card, used to indicate that the card possesses a certain attribute or ability. These keywords are used in place of the full explanation of the attribute or ability, and are instead explained in detail in sections 501 and 502 of the Comprehensive Rules. However, in certain sets some keywords are immediately followed by italicized, parenthesized text (known as "reminder text") fully explaining the meaning behind the keyword. Every keyword in a Core Set has reminder text.<sup id="cite_ref-remindertext_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-remindertext-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> With the release of <i><a href="/wiki/10th_Edition_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="10th Edition (Magic: The Gathering)">Tenth Edition</a></i>, however, premium (foil) cards in core sets will no longer contain reminder text.<sup id="cite_ref-foilremindertext_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-foilremindertext-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Keywords are typically created to summarize abilities or other attributes which are reasonably common in an individual expansion, expansion block, or in the game as a whole. Many keywords summarize abilities or attributes which are sufficiently complex such that the full explanation would fill the "rules text" area of the card; the smaller, one- or two-word keywords allow cards to be printed with a number of complex abilities, yet still be easily readable by players.</p>
<p>Keywords may also be used to summarize "block mechanics", certain card abilities or types of cards which are only designed and intended for use within a specific three-set "block" of expansions. While these keywords are almost always exclusive to their specific expansion block, they nonetheless become part of the official <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> game rules. Examples of keyworded block mechanics include <a href="#Bushido" title="">Bushido</a>, <a href="#Imprint" title="">Imprint</a>, and <a href="#Suspend" title="">Suspend</a>.</p>
<p>This list also includes ability words, which are italicized words that have no rules meaning but are used on cards with similar abilities. Ability words are usually used for non-keyworded block mechanics.</p>

<p>These are keywords which are currently used in the latest <a href="/wiki/10th_Edition_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="10th Edition (Magic: The Gathering)">Core Set</a>. They are also used in many expert-level expansions, but in those sets they are printed without reminder text.</p>
<p><a name="Defender" id="Defender"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Defender">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Defender</span></h3>
<p>Creatures with Defender can't attack. This is a keyword of an ability that was formerly associated with Walls, as the creature type Wall had implicit "rules baggage" that prevented such creatures from attacking. Some Walls had the reminder text <i>(Walls can't attack.)</i> to make this clear. After the release of <a href="/wiki/Champions_of_Kamigawa" title="Champions of Kamigawa">Champions of Kamigawa</a>, where the keyword was introduced, all Walls were retrofitted with the Defender keyword; however, the keyword isn't restricted to Walls.</p>
<p><a name="Double_Strike" id="Double_Strike"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Double Strike">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Double Strike</span></h3>
<p>A creature with Double Strike deals both <a href="#First_Strike" title="">first strike</a> and normal combat damage. For instance, a 1/2 creature with double strike such as <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade" rel="nofollow">Boros Swiftblade</a> would defeat a 2/1 creature in combat and survive, due to destroying it with first strike damage. It would also destroy a 2/2 creature, though be destroyed itself because the opposing creature survived to deal its own damage.</p>
<p><a name="Enchant" id="Enchant"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Enchant">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enchant</span></h3>
<p>This ability is written "Enchant (quality)". All Auras (Aura is a subtype of Enchantments) have this ability, and only Auras have this ability. An Aura comes into play attached to a permanent with the quality of its Enchant ability. An Aura can only be attached to a permanent with that quality. If an Aura is attached to a permanent that has lost the required quality or if the Aura is in play but not attached to anything (this most often occurs when the object it enchants leaves play), it is put into its owner's graveyard. Like Protection, the quality can be almost anything, but it normally has a permanent type associated with it (most commonly creatures), with exception of <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Volute" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Volute" rel="nofollow">Spellweaver Volute</a>, which targets instant cards in a graveyard. This ability was formerly seen in the type line instead of "Enchantment — Aura". The change started in the <a href="/wiki/Ravnica" title="Ravnica" class="mw-redirect">Ravnica</a> block.</p>
<p><a name="Equip" id="Equip"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Equip">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Equip</span></h3>
<p>This ability is written "Equip (cost)". It is found only on Equipment, a subtype of Artifacts that first appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Mirrodin" title="Mirrodin">Mirrodin</a></i>. A player pays the Equip cost as a sorcery (only during their own main phase when the stack is empty) and attaches it to a creature he or she controls. That creature becomes "equipped" and can then be referenced by the Equipment as the "equipped creature". If the Equipment is already attached to a creature, its controller may pay the Equip cost again to move it to another creature. However, the Equipment cannot simply be "dropped" by the creature it is attached to by paying the Equip cost. When a creature leaves play or stops being a creature (some noncreature cards can temporarily become creatures), any Equipment attached to it "falls off", becoming unattached but remaining in play. Similarly, an Equipment will "fall off" a creature if it becomes a creature. On the other hand, Equipment does not fall off if another player gains control of either the creature or the Equipment. In the first case, the original controller still controls the Equipment, and so can pay the Equip cost to move it to a creature he or she still controls. In the second case, the original controller still controls the creature, but the other player can pay the Equip cost to move it to a creature he or she controls.</p>
<p><a name="Fear" id="Fear"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Fear">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fear</span></h3>
<p>Fear is an example of "retroactive keywording," meaning it was an ability that had existed long before it was given a keyword; its eponymous card, <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Fear" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Fear" rel="nofollow">Fear</a>, was in the original set <i><a href="/wiki/Alpha_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="Alpha (Magic: The Gathering)">Limited Edition Alpha</a></i>. Creatures with Fear can't be blocked except by black creatures and/or artifact creatures. Fear has almost always appeared on black creatures (and a few artifact creatures), with the only exceptions being <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental" rel="nofollow">Dust Elemental</a> and <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Squealing+Devil" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Squealing+Devil" rel="nofollow">Squealing Devil</a>, the latter of which requires black mana to stay in play as a creature.</p>
<p><a name="First_Strike" id="First_Strike"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: First Strike">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Strike</span></h3>
<p>Creatures with first strike deal damage before creatures without first strike in combat. Because this damage "resolves" before other creatures deal their damage, a creature with first strike can potentially enter combat and kill an opposing creature before it can deal its damage.</p>
<p><a name="Flash" id="Flash"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Flash">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flash</span></h3>
<p>Flash is the keyword of an ability that has existed as far back as <i><a href="/wiki/Mirage_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="Mirage (Magic: The Gathering)">Mirage</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Cards with Flash may be played any time its controller could play an instant. Cards with that ability have been updated via rules errata to have Flash; this allows them to work with cards such as <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings" rel="nofollow">Mystical Teachings</a>.</p>
<p><a name="Flying" id="Flying"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Flying">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Flying</span></h3>
<p>Creatures with flying can't be blocked except by other creatures with Flying and/or <a href="#Reach" title="">Reach</a>. This ability is generally blue, though white has many creatures with flying as well. Black and red have relatively few flying creatures. Very few green creatures have flying, but often have the <i>Reach</i> ability, which permits them to block flying creatures without actually having flying.</p>
<p><a name="Haste" id="Haste"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10" title="Edit section: Haste">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Haste</span></h3>
<p>Creatures with this ability are able to attack and tap to activate abilities on the turn a player gains control of them, instead of waiting until their controller's next turn (an effect unofficially dubbed "summoning sickness" prevents a creature from attacking or using abilities with the tap symbol unless its controller controlled it since the start of the turn). Haste is an example of a retroactive keywording, as cards from almost every earlier set have possessed "may attack the turn [they] come into play" or "unaffected by summoning sickness," which was replaced by the word "haste." It was later changed to include untapping to activate abilities as well.</p>
<p><a name="Landwalk" id="Landwalk"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11" title="Edit section: Landwalk">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Landwalk</span></h3>
<p>This ability is written as "(Land type)walk". A creature with this ability is unblockable if the defending player controls a land with the printed land type (e.g. a creature with <i>swamp</i>walk is unblockable if the opponent has a swamp in play). This ability is somewhat rare, with swampwalk and plainswalk being the most common and least common, respectively.</p>
<p>Landwalk is not limited to the five basic lands; cards with <i>Legendary</i> landwalk, <i>nonbasic</i> landwalk, <i>Snow</i> landwalk, artifact landwalk, and landwalk for specific land cards have been printed.</p>

<p>Lifelink is a creature ability. Whenever a creature with lifelink deals damage, its controller gains that much life. Lifelink as a keyword was introduced in <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i>, though the ability itself already existed on numerous cards, which were all issued rules errata to have or grant lifelink, including cards like <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Spirit+Loop" rel="nofollow">Spirit Loop</a> (due to the limit of its enchant ability).

<p>This ability is written as "Protection from (quality)." A creature with protection from a quality cannot be enchanted, equipped, blocked, or targeted by anything with that quality, and all damage that would be dealt by a source of that quality will be prevented unless the damage can't be prevented (e.g. a creature with protection from red cannot be enchanted by red enchantments, blocked by red creatures, targeted by red spells and abilities, or take damage from red sources, barring exceptions which explicitly state otherwise).</p>
<p>Initially the ability was limited to "Protection from (color)", but was later expanded to allow "Protection from artifacts" in <i><a href="/wiki/Urza%27s_Legacy" title="Urza's Legacy">Urza's Legacy</a></i>, and officially expanded to allow "Protection from (quality)" in <i>Odyssey</i> with the printing of <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Beloved+Chaplain" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Beloved+Chaplain" rel="nofollow">Beloved Chaplain</a>.

<p>Reach is a creature ability which allows a creature that has it to block creatures with flying. The flying rules themselves were changed to clarify that interaction. Older cards with the ability to block as though they had flying were issued rules errata to have Reach instead.</p>

<p>Shroud is a static ability of players or permanents. A player or permanent with shroud cannot be the target of spells or abilities (even his or her own). While the keyword "shroud" was introduced in <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i>, the ability itself existed long before, first appearing on the <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=1890" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=1890" rel="nofollow">Svyelunite Priest</a> from <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Fallen_Empires" title="Fallen Empires">Fallen Empires</a></i>; cards which featured this ability were all issued rules errata to have or grant "shroud."</p>

<p>Creatures with trample may deal "excess" damage to the defending player if they are blocked. Under normal circumstances, if a 6/3 attacker is blocked by a 1/1 defender, the attacker's damage is <i>all</i> directed at the defender, despite it being only able to take 1 damage before being killed. If, however, the attacker should have trample, the attacking player <i>may</i> choose to have any excess damage (in this case, 5) "trample" over and be assigned to the defending player; this choice is allotted to the attacking player, and circumstances can arise in which "overkilling" the blocking creature is a more advantageous propositon. Even if the blocker doesn't take the damage (if it is prevented, for instance) the trample damage still carries over and hits the defending player. Furthermore, trample does not work when blocking; if a 6/3 trampling <i>defender</i> blocks a 1/1 attacker, the defender's extra 5 damage cannot be assigned to the attacking player.</p>
<p>Trample and cards which give creatures trample are most often green or red.</p>

<p>Keyword actions are not keyword abilities, but rather specialized game terms used to indicate a special action a player should take. This category of keywords was created with the release of <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-keyword_actions_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-keyword_actions-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> All keyword actions are used as verbs.</p>

<p>The term "attach" is used primarily on cards which can provide effects to certain other cards for an indeterminate amount of time, particularly Auras (see <a href="#Enchant" title="">Enchant</a>), Equipment (see <a href="#Equip" title="">Equip</a>), and Fortifications (see <a href="#Fortify" title="">Fortify</a>).

<p>"Clashing" is an action that determines the results of a spell. When a card says to clash, each player involved in the clash reveals the top card of his or her library, and then puts them on the top or bottom of their respective libraries. The winner of the clash is the player who revealed the card with the highest converted mana cost. If there is a tie, there is no winner. All cards with clash grant a bonus effect if their controller wins the clash.</p>

<p>To "counter" a spell or ability is to remove it from the stack, usually placing it in its owner's graveyard. This prevents the spell or ability from resolving. A spell can be countered in one of two ways. First, another spell can resolve that explicitly counters it. A spell that can "counter" another spell in this way is often referred to as a "counterspell," after the original <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Counterspell" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Counterspell" rel="nofollow">Counterspell</a>. Or, if all the targets of a spell or ability have become illegal (for example, a creature targeted by a black spell gained <a href="#Protection" title="">protection from black</a>), the game rules counter the spell. A spell that is countered this way is said to have "fizzled." Some cards specify that they "cannot be countered by spells or abilities." This only prevents the explicit method of countering spells; such a spell can still be countered by the game rules.</p>

<p>This ability is written as "Fateseal X" and is used as a verb. To fateseal, the controller looks at the top X cards of an opponent's library, and may put any number of those cards on the bottom of that player's library. Thus, this ability is functionally a <a href="#Scry" title="">Scry</a> on the opponent's library. In fact, fateseal was dubbed "evil scry" while in design.<sup id="cite_ref-evil-scry_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-evil-scry-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>This term describes a replacement effect for destruction, is generally written as "Cost: Regenerate", and is an ability only held by permanents. When the ability is played, a "regeneration shield" is set up on the permanent. The next time that permanent would be destroyed, instead all damage is removed from it, it is removed from combat (if it is in combat) and tapped. This ability is generally for creatures, though any permanent can be regenerated.</p>

<p>To "sacrifice" a permanent is to put it into its owner's graveyard, usually as a cost. This can only be done by the player that controls the permanent to be sacrificed. Note that this term is separate from other ways permanents can be put into their owners' graveyards, such as destruction (meaning regeneration has no effect) and state-based effects (a creature having 0 toughness, for example). Players are not allowed to sacrifice unless prompted to by an ability or spell.</p>

<p>Scry originally appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Fifth_Dawn" title="Fifth Dawn">Fifth Dawn</a></i> as a keyword ability, primarily on instants and sorceries as "Scry X," where X is a number. The player looks at the top X cards of his library, puts any number of them on the bottom of his library and the rest on top of his library in any order. In <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i>, Scry was redefined to be a keyword action, allowing it to be placed in the middle of an ability rather than as a "tack-on" to other abilities. In <i>Fifth Dawn</i>, the only version of scry was "Scry 2," though it was designed to allow other values. <i>Future Sight</i> included variations "Scry 1" through "Scry 4."</p>

<p>To "tap" a permanent indicates it is being used, often as a cost, or to indicate a creature that is attacking (except for creatures with <a href="#Vigilance" title="">Vigilance</a>). Most players tap their cards 90 degrees clockwise, though it is a matter of personal preference, and not specified by the game rules. Creatures a player controls that have not been under his or her control since the beginning of his or her turn cannot be tapped for their abilities that include the tap symbol, nor can they attack (regardless of whether they have Vigilance), but they can be tapped for costs that use the word "tap" (for example, "Tap two untapped creatures you control").</p>
<p>To "untap" a permanent is to return it to a vertical orientation, allowing it to be tapped again. A tapped permanent must be untapped before it can be tapped again as a cost.</p>
<p>As of the <i><a href="/wiki/Shadowmoor" title="Shadowmoor">Shadowmoor</a></i> block, untapping can also be a cost for creature abilities. It has its own special untap symbol (often called "Q"), and is separate from normal untapping. To use the untap symbol (Q), the creature must already be tapped.</p>

<p>Deathtouch is a creature ability. Whenever a creature with deathtouch deals damage to a creature, the damaged creature is destroyed. Similar abilities have appeared mostly on green and black cards, but in most cases those abilities were functionally different (typically triggering on combat damage and/or at end of combat). The current Deathtouch ability resolves outside of combat and only has to deal 1 point of damage ex; a creature with deathtouch is enchanted with power of fire and taps to deal 1 point of damage to target creature, when the damage resolves the damaged creature will be destroyed.</p>
<p>This ability was first printed on a single timeshifted creature from <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i>, <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer" rel="nofollow">Thornweald Archer</a>, but has reappeared on several cards in <i><a href="/wiki/Lorwyn" title="Lorwyn">Lorwyn</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Shards_of_Alara" title="Shards of Alara">Shards of Alara</a></i>, and Conflux<i>.

<p>Delve is a static ability that can appear on any card with a cost. When playing a card with delve, its controller may remove any number of cards in his or her graveyard from the game. For each card removed, the spell costs 1 colorless mana less to play.</p>

<p>Devour is a comes-into-play ability. When the creature in question comes into play, its controller may sacrifice any number of creatures in order to put +1/+1 counters on the creature coming into play. The number of +1/+1 counters given per creature sacrificed is determined by the number after the word Devour, i.e. "Devour 1" would give one +1/+1 counter for each creature sacrificed.</p>

<p>Cards with echo require an additional cost, their echo cost, to be paid in their controller's following upkeep phase after being played or gained control of. If the echo cost is not paid, then the card is sacrificed.</p>
<p>In the <i>Urza</i> block, this ability was written only as "Echo" with the mana cost always being the second payment. The rules were altered for Echo's return in <i><a href="/wiki/Time_Spiral" title="Time Spiral">Time Spiral</a></i> to be written as "Echo <i>cost</i>" instead, and all previous Echo cards were issued rules errata to have their echo cost be equal to their mana cost. Additionally, all Echo cards in <i>Time Spiral</i> had echo costs equal to their mana costs. <i><a href="/wiki/Planar_Chaos" title="Planar Chaos">Planar Chaos</a></i> introduced permanents with echo costs different from their mana costs, and <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i> introduced echo costs that are not simply mana payments.</p>

<p>This ability is written "Entwine (cost)". All cards with Entwine are modal spells with two choices. Normally, a player chooses one effect or the other. If the card's Entwine cost is paid in addition to its regular cost, both effects are played.</p>

<p>Epic is an ability that only appears on non-permanent spells. It has two effects: first, when a player plays a card with Epic, he or she can no longer play spells. However, at the beginning of each upkeep phase for the rest of the game, the player puts a (new) copy of the epic spell on the stack. This doesn't count as "playing" it (so it doesn't become a useless ability) and no mana cost is required.</p>

<p>Evoke is an alternate cost for a creature, generally a far lower cost, with the condition that the creature must be sacrificed upon entering play.

<p>When a creature with this ability is blocked by a creature without this ability, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.

<p>This ability is written "Flashback — Cost". When a card with this ability is in a player's graveyard, that player may pay its flashback cost and play the card from the graveyard. Then, instead of the card going to the graveyard, it's removed from the game. This allows a player to get a second use from a card. Cards with Flashback, as well as any card with an ability that acted from the graveyard in the <i><a href="/wiki/Odyssey_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="Odyssey (Magic: The Gathering)">Odyssey</a></i> block, have small headstone markers in front of their names.</p>

<p>Forecast is the ability associated with the <a href="/wiki/Ravnica_(plane)#The_Azorius_Senate" title="Ravnica (plane)">Azorius Senate</a>. It is written "Forecast — Cost: Ability" where the cost always includes revealing the card from the player's hand.

<p>This ability is written "Fortify (cost)". It is found only on Fortifications, a subtype of Artifacts that first appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i>. A player pays the Fortify cost as a sorcery (only during their own main phase when the stack is empty) and attaches it to a land he or she controls. That land becomes "fortified" and can then be referenced by the Fortification as the "fortified land". If the Fortification is already attached to a land, its controller may pay the Fortify cost again to move it to another land. However, the Fortification cannot simply be "dropped" by the land it is attached to by paying the Fortify cost. When a land leaves play or stops being a land, any Fortification attached to it "falls off", becoming unattached but remaining in play. Similarly, a Fortification will "fall off" a land if it becomes a creature. On the other hand, Fortification does not fall off if another player gains control of either the land or the Fortification. In the first case, the original controller still controls the Fortification, and so can pay the Fortify cost to move it to a land he or she still controls. In the second case, the original controller still controls the land, but the other player can pay the Fortify cost to move it to a land he or she controls.</p>

When a Modular creature is put into a graveyard, its controller may put all the +1/+1 counters on that creature onto another artifact creature. The second ability is targeted, so the counters can't be put on an artifact creature that can't be targeted. Note that this applies to all counters, not merely the counters granted by the Modular ability; thus, +1/+1 counters from previous dead Modular creatures or the abilities of cards like <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager" rel="nofollow">Arcbound Ravager</a> or <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher" rel="nofollow">Arcbound Crusher</a> would also be transferred.</p>

<p>This ability is written "Morph (cost)". A creature with morph may be played face-down by paying 3 colorless mana. While face-down, the creature is a colorless, nameless and typeless 2/2 creature. At any time, a player may pay the creature's Morph cost and turn the creature face-up. Only creatures with Morph may be played face-down. At the end of the game, or whenever a face down creature would leave play, it is revealed to all players. In addition to providing information to players, this ensures that players don't cheat by playing cards without morph face-down. If a card without morph is made face down by a spell or some other way, it can't be turned face up, because it has no morph ability with which to do so.</p>

<p>This ability introduced a new zone to the game, the phased-out zone. Cards in the phased-out zone are treated as though they have been removed from the game, with some exceptions.

It was keyworded with the release of <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i>, though older cards with the ability have not been changed to have poisonous. Whenever a creature with poisonous deals combat damage to a player, that player gets X poison counters. A player with ten poison counters loses the game.

<p>When a creature with Provoke attacks, its controller may have a creature the defending player controls untap and block that creature if it is able to do so. If the creature is already untapped, it still may be the target of this ability. This is a targeted ability, so it can't choose a creature that can't be targeted by the ability. The ability can choose a creature that can't block the creature that has it; this is useful against creatures with "pinning" abilities (that may remain tapped to give an effect as long as they are tapped). However, there is a period of time after the Provoke trigger resolves and the Declare Blockers step. This means that if the provoked creature has a "tap" ability and is not summoning sick, it can tap for its ability afterwards, and therefore not be required to block. Provoke is cumulative, though no creature has more than one instance of it.</p>

<p>Prowl, written "Prowl (cost)", is an alternate cost. A player can play a card for its Prowl cost if a creature controlled by that player dealt combat damage to a player that turn and shares a creature type with the Prowl card.

<p>Recover is a triggered ability that triggers when a card is in its owner's graveyard. It is written "Recover (cost)".

<p>Retrace allows players to replay a spell from the graveyard by paying its mana cost and all associated costs with the additional cost of discarding a land card.

<p>Ripple is a triggered ability that triggers when a card is played. It is written "Ripple X" where X is a number.

If any of them are copies of the Ripple spell that was played, then he or she can play those copies without paying their mana costs (this triggers their ripple abilities, so a player can ripple again.) Any cards not played are then put on the bottom of that player's library.

<p>This ability is written "Soulshift X," where X is a number. When a creature with Soulshift is put into a graveyard from play, its controller may return a Spirit card with a converted mana cost X or less from his graveyard to his hand. Most creatures with Soulshift had a Soulshift number one less than their converted mana cost, to prevent them from returning themselves. Almost all cards with Soulshift are Spirits (the only non-spirit is <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi" rel="nofollow">Promised Kannushi</a>).

<p>This ability is written "Splice onto (quality) (cost)." During the <i><a href="/wiki/Champions_of_Kamigawa" title="Champions of Kamigawa">Kamigawa</a></i> block, the quality was limited to Arcane. As a player plays a spell with the given quality, he may reveal a card in his hand with Splice onto that quality and pay its Splice cost. If he does, the splicing card's effects are added to those of the played spell, while the cards spliced onto the spell are kept in the player's hand. These effects are placed after the played spell's effects.

<p>Split Second is a static ability for spells. As long as a spell with Split Second is on the stack, players can't play spells or non-mana activated abilities. Triggered abilities, as well as effects that don't use the stack that can be played at instant speed (such as <a href="#Morph" title="">un-morphing</a> a face down permanent), can be played as normal while the spell is on the stack. Split Second is similar to the defunct Interrupt spell type, except that one card with Split Second cannot be played on the stack on top of another card with Split Second, whereas one Interrupt card could be played in response to another.</p>

<p>When a player plays a spell with Storm, they put a copy of that spell on the stack for each spell played before the Storm spell this turn. For example, if the Storm spell was the fifth spell played in the turn, four copies of the spell are put on the stack, so the player gets five instances of the spell.

<p>Suspend is a combination ability for spells. It is written "Suspend N — (cost)". Any time a player could play a spell with suspend, he may pay its suspend cost to remove it from the game and place N time counters on it.

(Timing restrictions don't apply, but effects that forbid a player from playing spells can.)</p>
<p>Cards may be given suspend when they are removed from the game by an effect. This effect always puts time counters on the card as well.

<p>This ability is written as "Vanishing X", where X is a number. A permanent with vanishing comes into play with X time counters on it. Every upkeep, a time counter is removed. When the last counter is removed, the card is sacrificed.</p>
<p>Vanishing is an updated version of an older mechanic, <a href="#Fading" title="">Fading</a>. Vanishing uses time counters to interact with <i><a href="/wiki/Time_Spiral" title="Time Spiral">Time Spiral</a></i> cards and induces sacrifice at the removal of the final counter.</p>

<p>Wither is a replacement ability that modifies damage. A creature or spell (e.g., Puncture Blast) with wither deals damage in the form of -1/-1 counters. Whenever a creature with wither would deal damage to another creature, instead of receiving damage, that creature receives a number of -1/-1 counters equal to the amount of damage that would have been dealt to it. Multiple instances of wither on a creature will not increase this amount of damage.</p>

<p>Chroma is an ability of a permanent or spell that checks for specific mana symbols of cards in specific zones. When a card with Chroma is played, it will indicate a specified effect or characteristic defining ability and repeat it for every color symbol in the checked zone.</p>
<p>Chroma was first introduced in <i><a href="/wiki/Eventide" title="Eventide">Eventide</a></i>, though a card from <i><a href="/wiki/Future_Sight" title="Future Sight">Future Sight</a></i>, <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Phosphorescent+Feast" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Phosphorescent+Feast" rel="nofollow">Phosphorescent Feast</a>, was issued errata to have the ability.</p>

<p>Domain is an effect involving the number of basic land types among lands you control. Depending how many basic land types you have (0-5), the effect may be stronger or weaker.</p>
<p>The mechanic first appeared in Invasion without the keyword printed on the cards. Domain officially became a keyword ability in the <i><a href="/wiki/Conflux" title="Conflux">Conflux</a></i> set.</p>

<p>This ability is written as "<i>Grandeur</i> — Discard another card named (name of card): (effect)". Grandeur is an ability word which has only appeared on legendary creatures, and was designed as a means of reducing the drawback of drawing multiple copies of the same legendary permanent.</p>

<p>Hellbent is the ability word associated with the <a href="/wiki/Ravnica_(plane)#The_Cult_of_Rakdos" title="Ravnica (plane)">Cult of Rakdos</a>.

<p>Sweep is an ability word used on spells with effects which can be strengthened by returning any number of basic lands (of a single type) to their owners' hands.</p>
<p>Sweep only appears on four cards in <i><a href="/wiki/Saviors_of_Kamigawa" title="Saviors of Kamigawa">Saviors of Kamigawa</a></i>.

<p>This ability was originally written "Threshold — ability". Whenever a player has seven or more cards in his graveyard, his or her cards gain any threshold abilities they might have. A player can't play an activated ability tied to threshold unless he or she has seven or more cards in their graveyard.</p>
<p>With the release of <i><a href="/wiki/Time_Spiral" title="Time Spiral">Time Spiral</a></i>, Threshold ceased to be a keyworded mechanic. It was instead redefined to be an ability word with no rules meaning attached to it. For instance, <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Nomad+Decoy" rel="nofollow">Nomad Decoy</a> was originally written:</p>
<dl>
<dd>W, Tap: Tap target creature.</dd>
<dd>Threshold — WW, Tap: Tap two target creatures. <i>(You have Threshold as long as you have seven or more cards are in your graveyard.)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And was changed to:</p>
<dl>
<dd>W, Tap: Tap target creature.</dd>
<dd><i>Threshold</i> — WW, Tap: Tap two target creatures. Play this ability only if seven or more cards are in your graveyard.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not all shifts were as simple as changing the reminder text to rules text; for example, <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Centaur+Chieftain" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Centaur+Chieftain" rel="nofollow">Centaur Chieftain</a> required more tinkering to preserve the original way the card worked.<sup id="cite_ref-Threshold_update_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Threshold_update-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>As <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> has progressed some keywords have been deemed unsuitable for continued use within the game and have been <i>discontinued</i>. While the abilities these keywords represent are still functional (with <a href="#Landhome" title="">one exception</a>) within the rules of the game, it has been strongly indicated that they will never appear on any cards printed in future sets.</p>
<p><a name="Banding" id="Banding"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_keywords&amp;action=edit&amp;section=103" title="Edit section: Banding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Banding</span></h3>
<p>Banding is an ability that has two parts.</p>
<p>First, a defending player determines how combat damage is dealt by an opposing creature if at least one of the creatures blocking the opposing creature has banding; normally the controller of the creature dealing the damage determines this.</p>
<p>Second, an attacking player may form "bands" of creatures with banding, though one non-banding creature can be included in a band. If one creature in the band becomes blocked, the whole band becomes blocked as well, whether or not the defender could block other creatures in the band. This can allow many small creatures to "gang up" on a single bigger creature that would survive blocking any one of these smaller creatures.</p>
<p>Banding appears primarily in white. <i><a href="/wiki/Weatherlight_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="Weatherlight (Magic: The Gathering)" class="mw-redirect">Weatherlight</a></i> was the last set to print cards with banding; Mark Rosewater has since indicated that the ability was retired because "even [the top players in the world] were confused by banding."<sup id="cite_ref-banding_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-banding-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>This ability is a limited version of <a href="#Banding" title="">Banding</a>, written as "Bands with other (creature type)." A creature with this ability has banding, but can only band with creatures that have either "Bands with other" of the same creature type or normal banding. Creatures with a different "Bands with other" and creatures without banding can't band with them. All other banding rules apply. Counter to the name of the ability, creatures with "Bands with other" <b>cannot</b> simply band with any creature that has the same type as the one listed in the ability; all creatures involved in a band must have the same "Bands with other" ability or normal Banding.</p>
<p>"Bands with Other" appears only in <i><a href="/wiki/Legends_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="Legends (Magic: The Gathering)">Legends</a></i>. No tournament legal cards were printed with this ability; the only creature that natively has the ability are Wolves of the Hunt tokens created by the card <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Hunt" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Hunt" rel="nofollow">Master of the Hunt</a>. Bands with Other was called "possibly the worst keyworded ability of all time" by <i>Magic</i> rules manager Mark Gottlieb in the article <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/21" class="external text" title="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/21" rel="nofollow">Absurd or Ridiculous?

<p>The term "bury" or "buried" was used in some early sets, where it served as shorthand for a two-part effect: destroying a permanent, and preventing that permanent from regenerating. Functionally it is still present in the game, with newer cards using a complete explanation for each part of the effect. (e.g. "Destroy target creature. It cannot be regenerated.")<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" title=""><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> "Bury" is found only in sets prior to Sixth Edition; all cards which contained the term "bury" have been issued new wording to use either a "destroy" or "sacrifice" effect. (e.g. <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?id=4166" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?id=4166" rel="nofollow">Wrath of God</a> or <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Abyssal+Gatekeeper" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?name=Abyssal+Gatekeeper" rel="nofollow">Abyssal Gatekeeper</a>, respectively)</p>

<p>This ability is written as "Fading X", where X is a number. A permanent with fading comes into play with X fade counters on it. Every upkeep, a fade counter is removed. If a counter cannot be removed, the card is sacrificed .</p>
<p>Fading is exclusive to <i><a href="/wiki/Nemesis_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="Nemesis (Magic: The Gathering)">Nemesis</a></i>.

<p>Landhome is a former keyword which was written as (land type)home. A creature with this ability may only attack a player who controls a land of the specified land type, and must be sacrificed if its controller does not control at least one land of that same type.

<p>The ability has been present since the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="Alpha (Magic: The Gathering)">Limited Editions</a> of the game, but was only keyworded in <i><a href="/wiki/Mirage_(Magic:_The_Gathering)" title="Mirage (Magic: The Gathering)">Mirage</a></i> with the introduction of <a href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=3343" class="external text" title="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=3343" rel="nofollow">Kukemssa Serpent</a>.

<p>Landhome is unique in that it is the only keyworded ability to later be <a href="/wiki/Retroactive" title="Retroactive">retroactively</a> removed from the rules. While cards which previously had landhome still feature the associated restrictions, they have been issued errata replacing the keyword "landhome" with rules text describing the abilities.</p>

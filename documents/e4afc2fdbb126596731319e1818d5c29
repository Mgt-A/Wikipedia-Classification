The show was written by Cleese and <a href="/wiki/Connie_Booth" title="Connie Booth">Connie Booth</a>, both of whom played main characters. The first series, in 1975, was produced and directed by <a href="/wiki/John_Howard_Davies" title="John Howard Davies">John Howard Davies</a>, and the second, in 1979, was produced by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Douglas_Argent&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Douglas Argent (page does not exist)">Douglas Argent</a> and directed by <a href="/wiki/Bob_Spiers" title="Bob Spiers">Bob Spiers</a>.</p>

<p>In May 1970, the <a href="/wiki/Monty_Python" title="Monty Python">Monty Python</a> team booked a stay in the Gleneagles Hotel in <a href="/wiki/Torquay" title="Torquay">Torquay</a>, while doing some location filming. During their stay, John Cleese became fascinated with the behaviour of the owner, <a href="/wiki/Donald_Sinclair_(hotel_owner)" title="Donald Sinclair (hotel owner)">Donald Sinclair</a>, whom Cleese later described as "the most marvellously rude man I've ever met". This included him throwing a timetable at a guest who asked when the next bus to town would arrive, and placing <a href="/wiki/Eric_Idle" title="Eric Idle">Eric Idle</a>'s suitcase behind a wall in the garden on the suspicion that it contained a bomb (it actually contained a ticking alarm clock). He also criticised the American-born <a href="/wiki/Terry_Gilliam" title="Terry Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Table_manners" title="Table manners">table manners</a> for not being 'British' (he had the fork in "the wrong hand" while eating).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Cleese and Booth stayed on at the hotel after filming for the Python show had finished, furthering their research of the owner's erratic, outspoken and <a href="/wiki/Prejudice" title="Prejudice">prejudiced</a> attitude.</p>
<p>At the time, Cleese was also a writer on the 1970s British TV <a href="/wiki/Sitcom" title="Sitcom" class="mw-redirect">sitcom</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Doctor_in_the_House_(TV_series)" title="Doctor in the House (TV series)">Doctor in the House</a></i> for <a href="/wiki/London_Weekend_Television" title="London Weekend Television">London Weekend Television</a>. An early prototype of the character that would become known as Basil Fawlty was developed in an episode ("No Ill Feeling") of the third <i>Doctor</i> series (titled <i>Doctor at Large</i>). In this edition, the main character checks into a small town hotel, his very presence seemingly winding up the aggressive and incompetent manager (played by <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Bateson" title="Timothy Bateson">Timothy Bateson</a>). The show was broadcast on 30 May 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Cleese also parodied the contrast between organisational dogma and sensitive customer service in many personnel training videotapes issued with a serious purpose by his company, <a href="/wiki/Video_Arts" title="Video Arts">Video Arts</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Bill_Cotton" title="Bill Cotton">Bill Cotton</a>, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid-1970s, said after the first series was produced that the show was a prime example of the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them, but trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing (having come into this fresh from helping rip up the TV comedy form book with his fellow Pythons), he gave the go-ahead. He said that the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, would never have let the show get to the production stage on the basis of the scripts.</p>

<p>Although the series is set in <a href="/wiki/Torquay" title="Torquay">Torquay</a> in <a href="/wiki/Devon" title="Devon">Devon</a>, none of it was shot in south west England. For the exterior filming, instead of a hotel, the <a href="/wiki/Wooburn_Grange_Country_Club" title="Wooburn Grange Country Club">Wooburn Grange Country Club</a> in <a href="/wiki/Buckinghamshire" title="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a> was used. It later served as a <a href="/wiki/Nightclub" title="Nightclub">nightclub</a> named "Basil's" for a short time after the series ended until it was destroyed by fire in March 1991. The remnants of the building were demolished and the site was bought by developers.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Other location filming was done mostly around the <a href="/wiki/Harrow,_London" title="Harrow, London">Harrow</a> area of north London: In the episode "The Germans", the opening shot is of <a href="/wiki/Northwick_Park_Hospital" title="Northwick Park Hospital">Northwick Park Hospital</a>. In the episode "Gourmet Night", the exterior of Andre's restaurant was filmed on Preston Road in the Harrow area. The launderette next door to the restaurant still exists today and Andre's is now a Chinese restaurant called "Wings". The famous sequence where Basil beats his car with a branch after it stalls was filmed on the corner of Mentmore Close and Lapstone Gardens in <a href="/wiki/Kenton" title="Kenton">Kenton</a>, just east of Harrow.</p>
<p>Cleese and Booth were married to each other at the time of the first series. By the second, they had been divorced for almost a year, after ten years of union (1968–78).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Both Cleese and Booth were so keen on every script being perfect, some episodes took four months and ten drafts to write until they were satisfied. <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Fawlty_Towers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Plot directions and examples">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot directions and examples</span></h2>
<p>The series focuses on the exploits and misadventures of short-fused <a href="/wiki/Hotelier" title="Hotelier">hotelier</a> <a href="/wiki/Basil_Fawlty" title="Basil Fawlty">Basil Fawlty</a>, his wife <a href="/wiki/Sybil_Fawlty" title="Sybil Fawlty">Sybil</a>, and their employees, <a href="/wiki/Porter" title="Porter">porter</a> and waiter <a href="/wiki/Manuel_(Fawlty_Towers)" title="Manuel (Fawlty Towers)">Manuel</a>, maid <a href="/wiki/Polly_Sherman" title="Polly Sherman" class="mw-redirect">Polly</a>, and (in the second series) chef <a href="/wiki/Terry_the_Chef" title="Terry the Chef" class="mw-redirect">Terry</a>. The episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in 'raising the tone' of his hotel and his increasing frustration at the numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so. Much of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff, and in particular his formidable wife, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as "that golfing <a href="/wiki/Bitis" title="Bitis">puff adder</a>", "my little <a href="/wiki/Piranha" title="Piranha">piranha</a> fish", and "my little nest of <a href="/wiki/Viper" title="Viper">vipers</a>". Despite this, he frequently feels intimidated, with her able to stop him in his tracks at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of "Basil!". At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance.</p>
<p>The plots are occasionally intricate and always <a href="/wiki/Farce" title="Farce">farcical</a>, involving coincidences, misunderstandings, cross-purposes and meetings both missed and accidental. The <a href="/wiki/Innuendo" title="Innuendo">innuendo</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Bedroom_farce" title="Bedroom farce">bedroom farce</a> is sometimes present, (often to the disgust of the <a href="/wiki/Social_conservatism" title="Social conservatism">socially conservative</a> Basil), but it is his eccentricity, not his lust, that drives the plots. The events that take place in each episode happen in such a way that they negatively affect Basil's personality, and test what little patience he has to breaking point, sometimes causing his mental state to deteriorate to the point where he has all but suffered a total breakdown by the end of the episode (some cut to the credits as he is on the brink of doing so).</p>
<p>The guests at the hotel are typically <a href="/wiki/Double_act" title="Double act">comic foils</a> to Basil's anger and outbursts. Each episode's one-shot guest characters provide a different characteristic that he cannot stand (including promiscuity, being working class, or being foreign). Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the disabled seem to annoy him, with the episode "Communication Problems" revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent <a href="/wiki/Abbott_and_Costello" title="Abbott and Costello">Abbott and Costello</a>-esque misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs Richards (not to mention the contributions from dotty resident <a href="/wiki/Major_Gowen" title="Major Gowen">Major</a>, the show's other regular character). By the end, Basil faints just at the mention of her name. This episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild <a href="/wiki/Black_humour" title="Black humour" class="mw-redirect">black humour</a> at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body, and in some of the comments made by Basil both about Sybil ("Did you ever see that film, <i><a href="/wiki/How_to_Murder_Your_Wife" title="How to Murder Your Wife">How to Murder Your Wife</a></i>? ... Awfully good; I saw it six times") and the guests ("May I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.").</p>
<p>Basil behaves particularly violently towards Manuel (an emotional, but innocent, <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spaniard</a> whose almost total lack of English vocabulary has him make some of the most elementary mistakes) including beating the hapless waiter with a frying pan and smacking him on the forehead with a spoon, despite Manuel's piteous pleading, echoing the antics of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Stooges" title="Three Stooges" class="mw-redirect">Three Stooges</a>. The violence directed at Manuel has been one of the few reasons for negative criticisms leveled at <i>Fawlty Towers</i> over the years. In this, and in other exaggerated physical mannerisms of Basil, <i>Fawlty Towers</i> employs <a href="/wiki/Physical_comedy" title="Physical comedy">physical comedy</a> reminiscent of the <a href="/wiki/Marx_Brothers" title="Marx Brothers">Marx Brothers</a>' fast-paced slapstick humour.</p>
<p>Basil often displays blatant snobbishness in order to climb the social ladder, frequently expressing disdain for the "<a href="/wiki/Hoi_polloi" title="Hoi polloi">riff-raff</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Yobbo" title="Yobbo">yobbos</a>" that he believes regularly populate the hotel. His desperation is apparent, as he makes increasingly hopeless manoeuvres and painful <i><a href="/wiki/Faux_pas" title="Faux pas">faux pas</a></i> in trying to gain favour with the wealthy, yet finds himself forced to serve and help people he sees as beneath him. As such, Basil's efforts tend to be counter-productive, with guests leaving the hotel in disgust and his marriage (and sanity) stretching further and further towards breaking point.</p>

<p><b><a href="/wiki/Basil_Fawlty" title="Basil Fawlty">Basil Fawlty</a></b>, played by <a href="/wiki/John_Cleese" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a>, is a <a href="/wiki/Snob" title="Snob">snobbish</a> and <a href="/wiki/Miser" title="Miser">miserly</a> <a href="/wiki/Misanthropy" title="Misanthropy">misanthrope</a> who is desperate to belong to a higher social class. He sees the successful running of the hotel as a means of achieving this ("turn it into an establishment of class..."), yet his job forces him to be pleasant to people he despises or aspires to be above socially.</p>
<p>He is terrified of his wife <a href="/wiki/Sybil_Fawlty" title="Sybil Fawlty">Sybil Fawlty</a>'s sharp tongue (in the episode "<a href="/wiki/The_Germans" title="The Germans">The Germans</a>", he wishes that it was this that was ingrowing and not her toenail). He yearns to stand up to her, but his plans frequently conflict with her desires. She is often verbally abusive towards him (memorably describing him as "an ageing, <a href="/wiki/Brilliantine" title="Brilliantine">brilliantined</a> stick insect") and though he is taller than Sybil, he often finds himself on the receiving end of her temper, expressed verbally or physically. Basil usually turns to Manuel or Polly to help him with whatever scheme he has planned, while trying his best to prevent Sybil from finding out. However, there are occasions where Basil is shown to lament about the time when there was passion in their relationship, now seemingly lost forever. Also, it appears as though he still does care for her in some way. The penultimate episode — <a href="/w/index.php?title=%22The_Anniversary%22&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="&quot;The Anniversary&quot; (page does not exist)">"The Anniversary"</a> — revolves around his efforts to put together a nice surprise anniversary get-together present, involving their closest friends. Things go wrong immediately as, because of Basil's pretending the date doesn't remind him of anything so as to enhance the surprise (gamely accepting a slap in the process), Sybil believes he really has forgotten, and leaves the hotel in a huff. In an interview for the documentary on the DVD box set, Cleese claims that this episode deliberately takes a slightly different tone from the others, focusing on fleshing out their otherwise inexplicable status as a couple (as well as saying that, if a third series had been made, there would have been more episodes like this).</p>
<p>In keeping with the general lack of explanation about the marriage, not much is revealed of the characters' back-stories. It is known that Basil served in the <a href="/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</a> — he was a cook for the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" title="British Army">British Army</a>, possibly as part of his <a href="/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Conscription in the United Kingdom">National Service</a>. He grossly exaggerates this period of his life, suggesting he spent time in active front line service and proclaiming to strangers: "I killed four men." To this Sybil jokes that "He was in the Catering Corps. He used to poison them." Basil is often seen wearing a military tie, (as well as that of the Royal Agricultural College), and his moustache seems to betray an army background. He also claims to have sustained an injury to his leg during the action, caused by <a href="/wiki/Shrapnel" title="Shrapnel">shrapnel</a>, although apparently it tends to flare up at surprisingly convenient times for him. The only person toward whom Basil, for the most part, consistently exhibits patience and decent manners is the old and senile <a href="/wiki/Major_Gowen" title="Major Gowen">Major Gowen</a>, a <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> veteran officer who permanently resides at the hotel.</p>
<p>Cleese himself described Basil as thinking that "he could run a first-rate hotel if he didn't have all the guests getting in the way," and "an absolutely awful human being", but says that in comedy, if an awful person makes people laugh, people unaccountably feel affectionate toward him.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Indeed, he is not entirely unsympathetic. The "Hotel Inspectors" and "Waldorf Salad" episodes both feature guests who are shown to be deeply annoying with constant, and unreasonable demands. Much of the time, he is an unfortunate victim of circumstance.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Fawlty_Towers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Sybil Fawlty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sybil Fawlty</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Sybil_Fawlty" title="Sybil Fawlty">Sybil Fawlty</a></b>, played by <a href="/wiki/Prunella_Scales" title="Prunella Scales">Prunella Scales</a>, is Basil's wife. She is often seen to be a more effective manager of the hotel, making sure Basil either gets certain jobs done or stays out of the way when she is handling difficult customers. Despite this, she rarely participates directly in the running of the hotel; during busy check-in sessions or meal-times, while everyone else is busy working, she is frequently talking on the phone to one of her friends (usually Audrey, who makes her sole on-camera appearance in "The Anniversary") with her phrase "Oohhh, I knoooooooow", or chatting to customers. She has a distinctive conversational tone and braying laugh, which her husband compares to "someone machine-gunning a seal". Being his wife, she is the only one who refers to him by his first name, and when (frequently) she barks this at him, he is generally stopped in his tracks, often flinching.</p>
<p>In addition to those mentioned above, Basil also refers to her by a number of epithets, occasionally to her face, including "that golfing puff-adder", "the dragon", "toxic midget", "the sabre-toothed tart", "my little kommandant", "my little nest of vipers", and "a rancorous, coiffured old sow". Despite these less than complimentary nicknames, Basil is terrified of her, and it is only once in the entire series that he loses patience to the point which he snaps at her.</p>
<p>Sybil and Basil Fawlty are said to have married on 17 April 1958 and started their hotel in 1960.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span title="This claim needs references to the episode(s) in which it occurs&#160;since February 2009" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">episode&#160;needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Fawlty_Towers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Polly Sherman">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Polly Sherman</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Polly_Sherman" title="Polly Sherman" class="mw-redirect">Polly Sherman</a></b>, played by <a href="/wiki/Connie_Booth" title="Connie Booth">Connie Booth</a>, is primarily employed as a <a href="/wiki/Waitress" title="Waitress" class="mw-redirect">waitress</a>, although she sometimes seems to be coerced into doing many other jobs in the hotel, perhaps for the extra money. She often stands as the voice of sanity during chaotic moments in the hotel, but is frequently embroiled in ridiculous masquerades as she loyally attempts to aid Basil in trying to cover a mistake he has made, or to keep something from Sybil. Her biggest test of loyalty came in the episode "The Anniversary", when Basil asked her to impersonate a purportedly ill Sybil - albeit in semi-darkness — in front of all the Fawltys' closest friends.</p>
<p>Polly is apparently employed part-time (during meal times), and is an art student whom Basil refers to as spending three years at university. (Polly is not referred to as a student in the second series.) Despite her part-time employment, as the most competent of the hotel staff, she is frequently saddled with many other duties. In one episode, she is seen to draw a sketch (presumably an <a href="/wiki/Impressionist" title="Impressionist" class="mw-redirect">impressionistic</a> <a href="/wiki/Caricature" title="Caricature">caricature</a>) of Basil, which everyone but Basil immediately recognises. Polly is also a student of languages, displaying ability with both Spanish and German; in "The Germans" episode Basil alludes to Polly's polyglot inclination by saying that she does her work "while learning two oriental languages". Like Manuel, she has a room of her own at the hotel.</p>
<p><a name="Manuel" id="Manuel"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Fawlty_Towers&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Manuel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Manuel</span></h3>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Manuel_(Fawlty_Towers)" title="Manuel (Fawlty Towers)">Manuel</a></b>, a <a href="/wiki/Waiter" title="Waiter" class="mw-redirect">waiter</a> played by <a href="/wiki/Andrew_Sachs" title="Andrew Sachs">Andrew Sachs</a>, is a well-meaning but disorganised and constantly confused <a href="/wiki/Spanish_people" title="Spanish people">Spaniard</a> from <a href="/wiki/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> with a poor grasp of the <a href="/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English language</a> and customs. He is verbally and physically abused by his boss. When told by either Basil, Sybil, or Polly what to do, he often answers, "¿Qué?" ("What?"). Manuel's character was used to demonstrate Basil's instinctive lack of sensitivity and tolerance. Every episode would involve Basil becoming enraged at least a couple of times by not only Manuel's confusion at his boss's bizarre and complicated demands, but also with basic requests. Manuel is afraid of Fawlty's quick temper and violent assaults, yet often expresses his appreciation for being given a steady source of income in what seems to him an endlessly perplexing society. His relentlessly enthusiastic demeanour and lavish pride in what little English he has grasped suggest that at least some of his persistent difficulties stem from his employers' persistently poor communication skills.</p>
<p>During the making of the series, Sachs twice suffered a serious injury while playing Manuel. Cleese describes using a real metal pan to knock him unconscious in "The Wedding Party" episode, although he would have preferred to use a rubber one. The original producer/director, John Howard Davies, explains in the director's commentary that he made Basil use a metal one and that he was responsible for most of the violence on the show, which he felt was essential and intrinsic to the type of comical farce that they were trying to create. Later, when his clothes were treated in order to make them give off smoke after he had been let out of the burning kitchen in "<a href="/wiki/The_Germans" title="The Germans">The Germans</a>", the corrosive chemicals used went through them and gave Sachs severe burns.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" title=""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Manuel's exaggerated Spanish accent is an integral part of the humour of the show. Sachs's native language is German, Sachs having emigrated to Britain as a child.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" title=""><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The character's nationality was switched to Italian (and the name to Paolo) for the Spanish dub of the show, while in <a href="/wiki/Catalonia" title="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> he is a Mexican (still called Manuel).<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" title=""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p><b><a href="/wiki/Terry_(Fawlty_Towers)" title="Terry (Fawlty Towers)">Terry</a></b>, played by <a href="/wiki/Brian_Hall_(actor)" title="Brian Hall (actor)">Brian Hall</a>, is the chef at Fawlty Towers. Terry's cooking style is quite relaxed, and Basil occasionally gets frustrated with his attitude. Terry appears in only the second series of episodes. During the first series, there was no regular chef character seen in the show. The only first series chef was "new" chef Kurt, seen in "Gourmet Night", who quickly proved himself incapable of holding the job because of a fondness for large volumes of wine, and a baffling passion for Manuel. Terry used to work in <a href="/wiki/Dorchester,_Dorset" title="Dorchester, Dorset">Dorchester</a> (not at <a href="/wiki/Dorchester_Hotel" title="Dorchester Hotel">The Dorchester</a>). In "<a href="/wiki/The_Anniversary_(Fawlty_Towers)" title="The Anniversary (Fawlty Towers)">The Anniversary</a>" he and Manuel come to blows as he takes offence at someone else cooking in his kitchen, and proceeds to sabotage Manuel's attempt to make <a href="/wiki/Paella" title="Paella">paella</a> for Sybil, leading to fisticuffs between them at the end of the episode.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Major_Gowen" title="Major Gowen">Major Gowen</a></b>, played by <a href="/wiki/Ballard_Berkeley" title="Ballard Berkeley">Ballard Berkeley</a>, is a slightly senile old soldier who holds permanent residence in the hotel, but is one of the few whom Basil likes. This is possibly a result of his former status in the military, making him a symbol of the <a href="/wiki/The_Establishment" title="The Establishment">establishment</a> status that Basil craves. He is often introduced as their "oldest resident". He enjoys talking about the world outside (especially the cricket scores and bemoaning workers' strikes) and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. He seems to have trouble forgiving <a href="/wiki/The_Germans" title="The Germans">the Germans</a> because of the World Wars (the best he can say about them is that German women supposedly make good card players). He also has outdated attitudes towards race, evidenced in the scene where he makes clear the ethnic difference between "<a href="/wiki/Wog" title="Wog">wogs</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Nigger" title="Nigger">niggers</a>" — but in an innocent manner. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's devious plans to go catastrophically awry, notably in "Communication Problems" when Basil tries his best to keep his secret (albeit successful) betting from Sybil.</p>
<p><b><a href="/wiki/Miss_Tibbs_%26_Miss_Gatsby" title="Miss Tibbs &amp; Miss Gatsby">Miss Tibbs &amp; Miss Gatsby</a></b>, played by <a href="/wiki/Gilly_Flower" title="Gilly Flower">Gilly Flower</a> and <a href="/wiki/Renee_Roberts" title="Renee Roberts">Renee Roberts</a> respectively, are the other two (often inseparable) permanent residents, who are slightly scatty spinsters. They seem to take a fancy to Basil, and feel as though they need to take care of him, although he vacillates between being overly kind to utterly rude during various talks with them.</p>
<p><b>Audrey</b>, a mostly <a href="/wiki/Unseen_character" title="Unseen character">unseen character</a>, had one on-screen appearance in "The Anniversary". Audrey is Sybil's lifelong best friend, and mostly appears in the form of gossiping, trivial telephone calls to Sybil. Audrey is a refuge for Sybil from the hotel and from Basil's ludicrous situations. When times get tough (Audrey has a dysfunctional relationship with her husband George), Sybil will offer solutions and guidance, often resulting in the catchphrase "Ooh, I know..." when she tries to commiserate with Audrey's problems. In Audrey's one on-screen appearance she is played by actress Christine Shaw. She is mentioned in "The Hotel Inspectors", "The Wedding Party", "Gourmet Night", "The Psychiatrist" and "The Kipper and the Corpse".</p>
<p><b>The Paperboy</b>, though only seen in one episode, is significant as he is revealed to be the prankster who rearranges the letters on the "Fawlty Towers" sign to read various (sometimes crude) phrases. The shot of the sign (with the hotel exterior in the background) appears at the beginning of every episode but one, "<a href="/wiki/The_Germans" title="The Germans">The Germans</a>", when a shot of a hospital is used, as this is the only episode which doesn't begin at the hotel. During the first series, the sign slowly deteriorated throughout the season until almost no letters were left in episode four. Episode five brings the first semi-anagram: "Warty Towels". In the second series, the first episode starts again with the sign spelling 'Fawlty Towers' with a few letters slightly askew, and changes in each subsequent edition, from the correct spelling to various semi-anagrams (only "Flowery <a href="/wiki/Twats" title="Twats" class="mw-redirect">Twats</a>" from the 11th episode, "The Anniversary", is a proper <a href="/wiki/Anagram" title="Anagram">anagram</a> using all original letters.)

<p>The first edition of <i>Fawlty Towers</i> was originally broadcast on 19 September 1975. The 12th and final show was first shown on 25 October 1979. The first series was directed by John Howard Davies, the second by Bob Spiers. Both seasons had their premieres on <a href="/wiki/BBC_Two" title="BBC Two">BBC2</a></p>
<p>Production of the last two episodes was disrupted by a <a href="/wiki/Strike_action" title="Strike action">strike</a> of BBC technical staff, which resulted in the recasting of the role of Reg (the wisecracking friend of Basil and Sybil) in "The Anniversary", and delayed the episode's transmission date by one week. The episode "Basil the Rat" was also delayed, not being screened until the end of a repeat showing six months later.</p>
<p><i><a href="/wiki/Not_the_Nine_O%27Clock_News" title="Not the Nine O'Clock News">Not the Nine O'Clock News</a></i> was originally scheduled to debut after an episode of <i>Fawlty Towers</i> and Cleese was to have introduced <i>Not the Nine O'Clock News</i> in a sketch referring to the technicians' strike, explaining (in character as Basil Fawlty) that there was no show ready that week, so a "tatty revue" would be broadcast instead. However, the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979" title="United Kingdom general election, 1979">1979 general election</a> intervened, and <i>Not the Nine O'Clock News</i> was postponed as being too political. Later that year, Cleese's sketch was broadcast, but its original significance was lost.</p>
<p>When originally transmitted, the individual episodes had no on-screen titles. The ones in common currency were first used for the VHS release of the series in the 1980s. There were working titles, such as "USA" for "Waldorf Salad", "Death" for "The Kipper and the Corpse", and "Rat" for "Basil the Rat", which have been printed in some programme guides. In addition, some of the early BBC audio releases of episodes on vinyl and cassette included other variations, such as "Mrs. Richards" and "The Rat" for "Communication Problems" and "Basil the Rat" respectively.</p>
<p>It has long been rumoured that a thirteenth episode of the series was written and filmed, but never progressed further than a rough cut <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" title=""><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>. Lars Holger Holm, author of the book <i>Fawlty Towers: A Worshipper's Companion</i>, has made detailed claims about the episode's content, but he provides no evidence of its existence and it is most likely a hoax or <a href="/wiki/Fan_fiction" title="Fan fiction">fan fiction</a>. Neither BBC officials nor <a href="/wiki/John_Cleese" title="John Cleese">John Cleese</a> have ever commented on the existence of a missing episode.</p>
<p>On the subject of whether more episodes would be produced, Cleese revealed (in an interview for the complete DVD box set, which was republished in the book, <i>Fawlty Towers Fully Booked</i>) that he once had the genesis of a feature-length special - possibly sometime during the mid-1990s. The plot (which was never fleshed out beyond his initial idea) would have revolved around the chaos that a now-retired Basil typically caused as he and Sybil flew to <a href="/wiki/Barcelona" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> to visit their former employee Manuel and his family. Of the idea, Cleese said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had an idea for a plot which I loved. Basil was finally invited to Spain to meet Manuel's family. He gets to <a href="/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport" title="London Heathrow Airport">Heathrow</a> and then spends about 14 frustrating hours waiting for the flight. Finally, on the plane, a <a href="/wiki/Terrorist" title="Terrorist" class="mw-redirect">terrorist</a> pulls a gun and tries to hijack the thing. Basil is so angry he overcomes the terrorist and when the pilot says, "We have to fly back to Heathrow", Basil says, "No, fly us to Spain or I'll shoot you". He arrives in Spain, immediately arrested and spends the entire holiday in a Spanish jail. He is released just in time to go back on the plane with Sybil. It was very funny, but I couldn't do it at the time. Making <i>Fawlty Towers</i> work at 90 minutes was a very difficult proposition. You can build up the comedy for 30 minutes, but at that length there has to be a trough and another peak. It doesn't interest me. I don't want to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cleese may also have relented because of the lack of Connie Booth's involvement. She had practically retreated from public life after the show finished (and had been initially unwilling to collaborate on a second series, which explains the four-year gap between productions.)</p>
<p>The decision by Cleese and Booth to quit before a third series has often been lauded, as it ensured an avoidance of the possibility that the show's immediately-high status could be weakened with lower quality work later down the line. (Cleese in particular was most likely motivated in making the choice by the end of his involvement with the <i><a href="/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus" title="Monty Python's Flying Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></i> TV series, which he departed after claiming to have run out of ideas for sketches.) Subsequently, it has inspired the makers of other shows to do likewise. Most notably, <a href="/wiki/Ricky_Gervais" title="Ricky Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a> and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Merchant" title="Stephen Merchant">Stephen Merchant</a> refused to make a third series of either <i><a href="/wiki/The_Office_(UK_TV_series)" title="The Office (UK TV series)">The Office</a></i> or <i><a href="/wiki/Extras_(TV_series)" title="Extras (TV series)" class="mw-redirect">Extras</a></i>, citing <i>Fawlty Towers'</i> short lifespan as the reason. <a href="/wiki/Rik_Mayall" title="Rik Mayall">Rik Mayall</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ben_Elton" title="Ben Elton">Ben Elton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lise_Mayer" title="Lise Mayer">Lise Mayer</a>, the writers behind <i><a href="/wiki/The_Young_Ones_(TV_series)" title="The Young Ones (TV series)">The Young Ones</a></i>, which also only ran for two series (each with six episodes likewise), used this explanation too. Elton also took the decision to end his next sitcom, <i><a href="/wiki/Filthy_Rich_%26_Catflap" title="Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap">Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap</a></i>, after only one series, despite its popularity.</p>

<p>The series was not held in as high esteem on its original broadcast as it is today. The <i>Daily Mirror</i> review of the show in 1975 had the headline "Long John Short On Jokes". <sup id="cite_ref-audience_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-audience-12" title=""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Eventually though, as the series began to gain popularity, critical acclaim soon followed. <a href="/wiki/Clive_James" title="Clive James">Clive James</a> writing in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Observer" title="The Observer">The Observer</a></i> said the second episode had him "retching with laughter".<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" title=""><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> By the time the series had ended, it was an overwhelming critical success. This did not stop the critic from <i>Television Today</i> from condemning such praise in an article on 14 September 1976, who wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"devoid of everything that makes good modern comedy. The programme is reminiscent of the post-war university drama society production.....The idea behind <i>Fawlty Towers</i> had the makings of one good sketch for John Cleese, who has in the past been shown to such good effect in original sketch material. The series, however, has over-acting and exaggeration on his part which is embarrassing to watch, writing that has no vestige of wit or skill about it and set pieces that are protracted and neither funny nor slapstick; the whole is pervaded by ill-humour. There is no warmth, no vulnerability of characters, no pathos, no visual cleverness, no funny lines. It is an amalgam of everything that does not reach out to an audience and is the epitome of self indulgence by those concerned. One funny walk and a shouting, bullying tone do not make a comedy series; it is twenty-five years too late for that.....Mr Cleese has to learn (if he has not already done so) not to be deluded by applauding critics just as he must observe those who do not applaud. <i>Fawlty Towers</i> is a try and there have to be many in comedy. But when the try has been made it is time to move on, to change and adapt, bearing the lessons in mind: the most important being a growing awareness of what one is good at doing and what is out of reach of one's ability and personal attributes"<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" title=""><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

He also admitted that he had been one of that chorus when he was young (despite his mother, Yvonne Gilan, being in one of the episodes; she played the saucy French woman in "The Wedding Party").

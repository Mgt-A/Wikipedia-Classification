<p><b>Meredith Gordon</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Jessalyn_Gilsig" title="Jessalyn Gilsig">Jessalyn Gilsig</a>, is the biological mother of <a href="/wiki/Claire_Bennet" title="Claire Bennet">Claire Bennet</a> and the older sister of <a href="/wiki/Flint_Gordon" title="Flint Gordon" class="mw-redirect">Flint Gordon</a>. She does her best to watch over him, leading their abusive father to tell Flint, "God gave you an older sister instead of a brain." Like her younger brother, Meredith has <a href="/wiki/Pyrokinetic" title="Pyrokinetic" class="mw-redirect">pyrokinetic</a> abilities, which both enable her to create fire from her body and grant her immunity to the effects of it. The two were separated after she accidentally burned down her father's house with their father inside it, though after years of effort Meredith tracked down and reunited with him. She eventually began a relationship with <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Petrelli" title="Nathan Petrelli">Nathan Petrelli</a>, and the two conceived a baby, Claire. Meredith was later attacked by Company Agents <a href="/wiki/Noah_Bennet" title="Noah Bennet">Noah Bennet</a> and Claude Rains, and her powers created a large explosion that consumed the building. The Company was led to believe that Meredith perished, while Meredith herself believed Claire had died. Years later, Meredith was captured by Agent Eric Thompson, Sr., while robbing a convenience store with Flint. Rather than be a prisoner for the rest of her life, she agreed to train to become an agent. However, after she learned that Flint was also captured and was to become an agent, she felt that the Company was just using the two of them, and broke Flint out. The siblings were separated after Thompson tracked them down, and she was recaptured. However, Thompson lets her go after learning that Claire was her daughter.</p>
<p>Claire manages to track her down after many years, though the two only meet briefly before separating. Meredith blackmails Claire's biological father, <a href="/wiki/Nathan_Petrelli" title="Nathan Petrelli">Nathan Petrelli</a>, for $100,000 before leaving, and hides his identity from Claire. She later returns at the request of Noah to help protect Claire from the escaped Level Five villains. She helps Claire to admit that, contrary to her claims that she wants to be trained so that she can help people, she actually wants to learn how to fight so that she can get revenge on Sylar. Meredith later confronts <a href="#Eric_Doyle" title="">Eric Doyle</a>, with whom she has past connections, believing Claire may have gone there. However, she is rescued by Claire and Sandra Bennet, and later accepts Noah's request to rejoin the Company as his partner. When Sylar later takes over Primatech and holds Meredith, Claire, Noah, and Angela hostage, he injects Meredith with high adrenaline, eliminating her control over her pyrokinetic abilities. She and Noah are then placed in a Level 5 cell, where her lack of control threatens to burn Noah alive. Claire manages to break them free and tries to save Meredith, but Noah pulls her away. They make their escape as Meredith loses total control, destroying the Primatech facility.</p>

He is one of the twelve founders of the Company, and like his son, Maury is a <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepath</a>; however, his powers are much more developed than Matt's. Instead of just reading surface thoughts, he can read people's memories and manipulate their perceptions of reality, allowing him to trap people in nightmares based on their deepest fears and insecurities. He can either render a person unconscious and manipulate their dreams, or he can induce "waking nightmares" that allow the person's real body to move. He is also able to detect Molly Walker, who calls him "the Nightmare Man" attempting to locate him using her power, and he does not require close proximity to affect a person's mind. He is one of several people swayed into believing that those with abilities are superior to humans by <a href="/wiki/Adam_Monroe" title="Adam Monroe">Adam Monroe</a>, whom he loyally served.

Wanting to be more than human so that he can make up for his fellow Marines that died, he is the first person to try the newly-perfected formula, which grants him the ability of enhanced strength. However, as he is about to go stop Flint Gordon and Peter Petrelli from destroying the lab and the formula in "Dual", his neck is snapped by Knox.</p>

<p><b>Usutu</b>, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Ntare_Mwine" title="Ntare Mwine">Ntare Mwine</a>, makes himself known to Matt after he is teleported to Africa by the future Peter Petrelli. He had painted an image of the earth exploding on a nearby rock. This image appears several times in the episodes "The Second Coming" and "The Butterfly Effect", painted on various objects in various places. He also seems to have an extensive knowledge of Matt's life, having painted the major events of Matt's story arc in Volume One when he was just a child. Like the precognition demonstrated by <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Mendez" title="Isaac Mendez">Isaac Mendez</a>, this skill can be activated at will, though Usutu prefers to listen to music while he works. In a discussion with Parkman, Usutu reveals that he is aware of various changes in the timeline, specifically events that change his earlier predictions. As Hiro finishes his own spirit journey, Usutu is decapitated by <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Petrelli" title="Arthur Petrelli" class="mw-redirect">Arthur Petrelli</a>, but appears in Suresh's Loft with Ando, Hiro, Matt, and Daphne in "<a href="/wiki/Dual_(Heroes)" title="Dual (Heroes)">Dual</a>".</p>
<p>After his death, Matt Parkman experiences as of yet unexplained visions of Usutu in "<a href="/wiki/It%27s_Coming" title="It's Coming">It's Coming</a>" and "<a href="/wiki/Dual_(Heroes)" title="Dual (Heroes)">Dual</a>", although they do not speak to him, and he is unaware that Usutu is dead.</p>
<p>In addition to his powers, Usutu is able to make a traditional food paste from tree roots and hyena dung which temporarily allows others to engage in a "spirit walk." In practice, this spirit walk roughly translates into a series of precognitive visions of future events or postcognitive visions of significant past events that are personally relevant to whomever consumes the paste. It is unknown whether or not this works on everyone. What is clear is that this paste has worked on two other characters with powers, though their powers did not involve precognition. Usutu freely shares the paste with <a href="/wiki/Matt_Parkman" title="Matt Parkman">Matt Parkman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura" title="Hiro Nakamura">Hiro Nakamura</a>, despite being a family tradition, and the two lapse into trances shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>He later appears to Matt, telling him that he is becoming a prophet like himself. Matt then could draw the future in the same manner as Usutu and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Mendez" title="Isaac Mendez">Isaac Mendez</a> when their eyes go blank.</p>

After surviving the explosive disaster at the Pinehearst facility, she is detained and interrogated by Angela Petrelli and a subordinate named Carlos to obtain the location of a vial of the serum left intact after the incident. She ultimately claims to have destroyed the vial herself and is eventually released. Later in a public bathroom, she reveals that she hid the remaining vial in a bullet wound to her left shoulder inflicted by a fellow recruit during the disaster at Pinehearst. Angela and Carlos are waiting for her outside the bathroom, and after confiscating the vial, they abduct her as well. Angela keeps her imprisoned to force her to embrace her ability, which she eventually does by teleporting out of the building as Angela secretly watches.</p>

In the stories, she is the love interest of Takezo Kensei, though <a href="/wiki/Hiro_Nakamura" title="Hiro Nakamura">Hiro Nakamura</a>'s time travelling reveals that it is actually Hiro whom she loves. Initially, Hiro enamors Yaeko to Kensei by posing as him and rescuing her. This led to Yaeko eventually falling in love with Kensei, but upon discovering that it was actually Hiro who saved her in the first place, she concludes that she was actually in love with Hiro the entire time. Upon witnessing Hiro and Yaeko kiss, Kensei feels betrayed and turns Yaeko, her father (the swordsmith) and Hiro over to Whitebeard and his army. After they escape and Hiro scatters Whitebeard's army, Yaeko spreads his tale under Kensei's name.</p>
<p>In historical context (<i><a href="/wiki/Heroes_Evolutions" title="Heroes Evolutions">Heroes Evolutions</a></i>), Yaeko was known as the Princess.

The Dragon was looking to take Kensei's love, the Princess. As a response to the Dragon's demands, Kensei cut out his own heart and gave it to the Dragon. What happens next is a bit of a mystery. Legend says that Kensei may have died, or that he was brought back to life by the Dragon, and he and the Princess went away together. However, according to legend, Yaeko is said to be the princess in question, and also the creator of the Takezo tapestries.</p>

He often denies Nathan's orders by shooting to kill instead of to incapacitate; a favorite target of his was Claire even when Nathan explicitly said not to even touch her.

When the auditor saw this happening, she decided that the operation was necessary and gave them the funding they needed. Danko's tactics are different from Nathan's and Noah Bennet's in that Danko, who is heavily prejudiced against superpowered posthumans, prefers to take it to the extreme.

His crew was immediately attacked by an unseen army, and Adam soon found himself fighting another Evan... and another, and another. It turned out Evan had the ability to duplicate himself, effectively making him a one-man army. Adam attempted to track down and kill the original Evan, believing this would stop all the duplicates; however, this proved futile when he found that the duplicates can also duplicate themselves, and Adam was hopelessly outmatched.</p>

<p><b>Sabine Hazel</b> is a medical professional (specifically a biologist) in the employ of the Company who was selected by Bob Bishop to become an agent and partner of whom she believed was the real (or "Root") Julien Dumont. Initially only together to protect him, eventually Sabine succumbed to her desires and became his lover. Secretly, Sabine had been contacted by the mysterious Evs Dropper, who claimed Dumont was an imposter. Sabine, however, did not believe the warning.</p>
<p>After a bag and tag mission of several rogue Dumont duplicates, Sabine goes after the one in the Congo alone, and claims he escaped. In actuality, the third clone jumped from a cliff and died. When Sabine reports back, Dumont claims he can still sense the third one alive. Suspicious, Sabine is able to lure Dumont out into the forest, where she forces him at gunpoint to confess that, not only is he really another duplicate, but that Sabine has never met the real Dumont. Upon demanding to learn what has happened to the real Dumont, an infuriated Sabine kills the Dumont clone, and takes his keycard, using it to access the detention facility at Primatech Research. Sabine finds the original Dumont, kept in an induced coma and hooked up to machinery that activates his cloning powers against his will. The Company had been using him as an agent factory for years, producing an endless supply of clones to recruit while keeping the original alive and protected, as it is believed that if he dies, all his clones would die as well. Sabine proceeds to disconnect and extract Dumont, even understanding that he's not the Dumont she loved, and the two flee from the Company.</p>
<p>The two are then rescued by another Dumont clone, and Sabine is taken to a safe house where Sabine meets Evs Dropper, whom is revealed to be the original Dumont's wife, Connie Logan. Sabine is told by Connie of how Dumont submitted himself for testing, only for the Company to fake his death. Sabine agrees to aid Connie's plan to destroy the Company. Soon afterwards, Sabine keeps the original Dumont safe as a pitched battle ensues, where Connie, Penny and many clones are killed in battle with the Kill Squad. After the dying Connie tells Sabine to escape with Dumont, the two are captured by Gael Cruz and Bianca Karina. Initially, Sabine assumes they intend to keep harvesting Dumont, but is instead shocked when Bianca kills Dumont to wipe out the clone army. Instead, "The Package" they have been seeking is Sabine herself, as they know (before Sabine herself) that she is pregnant with Dumont's clones' son, who will be an evolved human. Sabine is then returned to Primatech and incarcerated.</p>

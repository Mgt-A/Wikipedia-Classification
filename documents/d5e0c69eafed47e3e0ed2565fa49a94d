<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Formation_(American_football)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Offensive formations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Offensive formations</span></h2>
<p>At the highest level of play in the <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">NFL</a> and <a href="/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a>, the one constant in all formations is the <a href="/wiki/Offensive_lineman" title="Offensive lineman" class="mw-redirect">offensive line</a>, consisting of the left and right <a href="/wiki/Tackle_(American_football_position)" title="Tackle (American football position)" class="mw-redirect">tackle</a>, left and right <a href="/wiki/Guard_(football)" title="Guard (football)" class="mw-redirect">guard</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Center_(football)" title="Center (football)" class="mw-redirect">center</a>. These five positions are often referred to collectively as the "line", and have the primary role of blocking. By rule there must be two additional players on the line of scrimmage called Ends. These players are eligible receivers and may play near the linemen (tight ends) or farther away (split end or wide receiver). Most teams play additional players near (but still off) the line of scrimmage to act as extra pass receivers.</p>
<p>Of the four players behind the line, one is always the quarterback (defined as the player who receives the ball from the center). The quarterback has four options once he receives the ball:</p>
<ul>
<li>He may keep the ball and run with it</li>
<li>He may hand or pitch the ball laterally or backwards to another player, who may then run or throw a forward pass</li>
<li>He may throw a forward pass to an eligible receiver</li>
<li>He may punt the ball to the other team</li>
</ul>
<p>The three other backs can be <a href="/wiki/Running_back" title="Running back">half backs</a>, (who primarily carry the ball), <a href="/wiki/Fullback_(American_football)" title="Fullback (American football)">fullbacks</a>, (who primarily block), or they can play near (but not on) the line of scrimmage to act as extra <a href="/wiki/Tight_end" title="Tight end">tight ends</a> or wide receivers. A tight end that fills the role as the 4th back is often called an "<a href="/wiki/H-Back" title="H-Back" class="mw-redirect">H-Back</a>" and a wide receiver that fills that role is sometimes known as a "flanker" or a "slot" receiver (depending on where he lines up). Most formations have a "strong" side (the side with the tight end, or the side with more players) and a "weak side" (the side opposite the tight end, or the side with fewer players).</p>
<p>The ends, which may be either <a href="/wiki/Wide_receiver" title="Wide receiver">wide receivers</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Tight_end" title="Tight end">tight ends</a>, may catch a passed ball or receive a handoff.</p>
<p>Below are the most common and historically significant offensive formations, along with descriptions and diagrams to display each. In each case, the diagrams will use the following symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>QB = quarterback (the player who receives the snap to start the play)</li>
<li>C = center (always the player who snaps the ball)</li>
<li>G = guard</li>
<li>T = tackle</li>
<li>TE = tight end (also for H-back)</li>
<li>WR = wide receiver (split end, flanker or slot receiver)</li>
<li>HB = half back (the primary ball carrier)</li>
<li>FB = full back (the primary blocking back)</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not exhaustive; there are hundreds of different ways to organize a team's players while still remaining within the "7 on the line 4 in the backfield convention". Still, this list of formations covers enough of the basics that almost every formation can be considered a variant of the ones listed below.</p>
<p><a name="Rules" id="Rules"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="/w/index.php?title=Formation_(American_football)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rules</span></h3>
<p>The offense is required to set up a formation before a play, subject to several rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>The formation must have at least 7 players on the <a href="/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage" title="Line of scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a><sup id="cite_ref-positionofplayers_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-positionofplayers-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>. The 7 players are not required to be next to each other, so they may spread out across the width of the field, but this is rare; most offenses place at least 5 players together in a continuous line. Although it is rare (because it reduces the number of eligible receivers), teams may place more than 7 players on the line</li>
<li>The other players not on the line (usually 4 in number) may be positioned anywhere, but all must be at least 1 yard behind the 7 or more players on the line of scrimmage<sup id="cite_ref-positionofplayers_0-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-positionofplayers-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>. The traditional saying is "7 on the line, 4 in the backfield" but this is something of a misnomer, as "backfield" usually refers to the area directly behind the offensive line. 3 of the 4 "backfield" players (i.e., the 3 not receiving the snap from center) may line up as wide receivers as long as they are behind the line of scrimmage; these are known as <i>slot</i> receivers.</li>
<li>Of the 7 (or more) players on the line of scrimmage, all except those at either end of the line are <i>ineligible receivers</i>: these players may not touch or catch a forward pass<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title=""><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> (unless it is first touched by an eligible receiver, including a deflection by a defensive player), and on a forward pass play, they may not advance <i>downfield</i> (i.e., across the <a href="/wiki/Neutral_zone_(American_football)" title="Neutral zone (American football)">neutral zone</a>) before the pass crosses the neutral zone. Ineligible receivers may advance freely on a running play or after a pass is thrown. These players typically have uniform numbers in the range 50-79 to indicate they are ineligible.</li>
<li>In the NFL, players with numbers (50-79) indicating ineligibility, and who are not among the ineligible receivers, must report to the referee as eligible; failure to do so will result in a penalty to the offense<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" title=""><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup>. The referee will relay that information to the defensive captain<sup id="cite_ref-positionofplayers_0-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-positionofplayers-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>, and he will generally announce it to spectators as well. After reporting as eligible, those players may line up at any legal position just as if they were normally eligible receivers. Offenses sometimes use this tactic in a short yardage situation to provide extra blocking, and some plays are even designed for a designated player to receive a pass.</li>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/High_school_football" title="High school football">high school</a> (NFHS) numbers 50-79 are always ineligibile, and may not receive. In fact if one of these players touch a forward pass before it is touched by a defensive player, it is a penalty for offensive pass interference (15 yards plus loss of down). The numbers can only be eligible during a scrimmage kick (punt or field goal).</li>
<li>The offense must <i>set</i> before the play: all players must take their positions and remain motionless for at least 1 second before the ball is snapped.<sup id="cite_ref-positionofplayers_0-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-positionofplayers-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Typically, after the offense breaks the huddle and walks to the line, the quarterback will call "set" and then begin his regular snap count. The offense is allowed to shift in certain situations and reorganize, but they must again set once they assume new positions. Once set, offensive players may not move until the snap and may not flinch to simulate a snap (with the exception of the man in motion, described below). A violation is a <i>false start</i> penalty.</li>
<li>The offense may put one of the 4 backfield players <i>in <a href="/wiki/Motion_(football)" title="Motion (football)">motion</a></i> after the set but before the snap. The motion must be either parallel to or (if in the backfield) away from the line of scrimmage at the <a href="/wiki/Snap_(football)" title="Snap (football)">snap</a><sup id="cite_ref-positionofplayers_0-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-positionofplayers-0" title=""><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>; certain types of football such as <a href="/wiki/Arena_football" title="Arena football">arena football</a> allow forward motion at the snap. In <a href="/wiki/Canadian_football" title="Canadian football">Canadian football</a>, all of the players in the backfield can be in motion, in any direction, at the time of the snap, as long as they have not crossed the line of scrimmage before the snap.</li>

The T-formation, one of the most basic formations in football</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/T_formation" title="T formation">T formation</a></div>
<p>The T formation is the precursor to most modern formations, in that it places the quarterback directly under <a href="/wiki/Center_(football)" title="Center (football)" class="mw-redirect">center</a> (in contrast to its main competitor of its day, the <a href="#Single_wing" title="">single wing</a>, which had the quarterback receiving the ball on the fly).</p>
<p>It consists of three running backs lined up in a row about five yards behind the quarterback, forming the shape of a T. It may feature two tight ends (known as the Power T) or one tight end and a wide receiver (in this case known as a split end). The latter variation is known as the Split T, created in 1941 by <a href="/wiki/Missouri_Tigers_football" title="Missouri Tigers football">University of Missouri</a> head coach Don Faurot. This is a running formation in which the <a href="/wiki/Option_offense" title="Option offense">option</a> is effective. The T formation was made famous by the <a href="/wiki/Minnesota_Golden_Gophers_football" title="Minnesota Golden Gophers football">University of Minnesota</a> in the 1930s and 1940's (winning five national titles). When the <a href="/wiki/Chicago_Bears" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a> used the T-formation to defeat the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Redskins" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> by a score of 73–0 in the 1940 NFL championship game, it marked the end of the Single Wing at nearly all levels of play, as teams, almost overnight, moved to formations with the quarterback "under center" like the T.</p>
<p>One variation of the T-Formation would be where all the runningbacks would be closer than usual, being at fullback depth rather than halfback depth. Another variation of the "balanced T" formation is the so-called "unbalanced T" formation <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title=""><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>. In this configuration the line of scrimmage has an end and tackle left of center, while to the right of the center are two guards a tackle and an end. This creates a line that is weighted toward the right of the center. With the backfield lining up in the conventional "T" formation behind the center (quarterback, two halfbacks and fullback), the resulting configuration is "unbalanced" due the asymmetry of the placement of the linemen.</p>

Basic I formation.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is one of the most common formations used at all levels of football. It consists of two backs lined up behind the quarterback, with the back closest to the quarterback being called the fullback and the back behind the fullback called the <a href="/wiki/Running_back" title="Running back">running back</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tailback" title="Tailback" class="mw-redirect">tailback</a>, or <a href="/w/index.php?title=I-back&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="I-back (page does not exist)">I-back</a>. The two backs line up either in a line (hence the name of the formation since it looks like a letter <i>I</i>) or with the fullback "offset" to either side. The fourth back is most commonly employed as an extra wide receiver. Here are three diagrams of I-Formation, strong side right (that is, with the <a href="/wiki/Tight_end" title="Tight end">tight end</a> lining up to the right, typical for a right-handed quarterback). Notice that the 4th back required by the rules is the set-back wide receiver at the right (called the flanker).</p>

Two other I formation variations include the <b>Maryland I</b> and the <b>Power I</b>. These formations lack a flanker, and use the maximum 3 running backs rather than the standard 2. They are used primarily as running formations. These may employ either tight ends or split ends (wide receivers) or one of each. The Maryland I was popularized by Thomas (TJ) Dodd being first called the "T" formation due to how the formation is set up in a T. It was first used on October 30, 1992. It is now called the "Maryland I" due to The University of Maryland being one of the last few teams to use it. The Jackson Park Raiders of Chicago also use this formation. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title=""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<div class="rellink noprint relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Ace_formation" title="Ace formation" class="mw-redirect">Ace formation</a></div>
<p>Also known as "single back" formation. Consists of 1 running back lined up about five yards behind the quarterback. The other 2 backs can either act as extra tight ends or wide receivers. This formation is normally used for a pass play, but can also be good for running, as defenders must move at least one player out of the middle of the field (the "box", between the tackles on the offensive line) to cover the additional wide receiver. In passing situations, this formation (and similar variations) is known as <i>max protect</i> as it requires the running back and two tight ends to stay in the vicinity to block an oncoming pass rush and leaves only two wide receivers to catch a pass downfield.<br /></p>

Typical Single-back formation</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here is the basic single-back set. Notice the absence of a fullback and the addition of the extra flanker. Since he is lined up in the space between the tackle and the split end, he is called the "slot" receiver. This formation may be referred to as "single back, slot left."</p>
<p>A variation of the ace is known as the spread formation. It utilizes 4 wide receivers and no tight ends. In the NFL, this formation was the basis of the <a href="/wiki/Run_%26_Shoot" title="Run &amp; Shoot">Run &amp; Shoot</a> offense that was popular in the 1980s with teams such as the <a href="/wiki/Detroit_Lions" title="Detroit Lions">Detroit Lions</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Houston_Oilers" title="Houston Oilers" class="mw-redirect">Houston Oilers</a> but has since fallen out of favor as a primary offensive formation.<br /></p>

Spread formation</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is often used as a pass formation, because of the extra wide receivers. It also makes an effective run formation, because it "spreads the field" and forces the defense to respect the pass, thus taking players out of the box. Certain college programs, such as the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Hawaii" title="University of Hawaii">University of Hawaii</a> and <a href="/wiki/Texas_Tech_Red_Raiders" title="Texas Tech Red Raiders">Texas Tech</a> still use it as their primary formation. Brigham Young University also uses the spread offense, although they tend to employ their tight ends more frequently than the University of Hawaii and Texas Tech.

<p><a href="/wiki/Joe_Gibbs" title="Joe Gibbs">Joe Gibbs</a>, twice head coach of the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Redskins" title="Washington Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>, devised an ace variation that used a setback, or "flexed" tight end known as an <a href="/wiki/H-back" title="H-back">H-back</a>. In this formation, the normal tight-end is almost exclusively a blocker, while the H-back is primarily a pass receiver. This formation is often referred to as a "Two Tight End" set. Some teams (like the <a href="/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts" title="Indianapolis Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a> under <a href="/wiki/Tony_Dungy" title="Tony Dungy">Tony Dungy</a>) use this formation with both tight ends on the line and use two flankers.

<p>Also called the "split backs" or "three-end formation", this is similar to the I-formation and has the same variations. The difference is that the two backs are split behind the quarterback instead of being lined up behind him.</p>
<p><a href="/wiki/Clark_Shaughnessy" title="Clark Shaughnessy">Clark Shaughnessy</a> designed the formation from the T Formation in 1949 after acquiring halfback <a href="/wiki/Elroy_Hirsch" title="Elroy Hirsch">Elroy "Crazy Legs" Hirsch</a>.

<p>This archaic formation was popular for most of the first 50 years of modern American football, but it is rare today, except as a novelty. For instance, the <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> occasionally used variations of the single wing in the 2006 season with the fullback directly behind the strong side tackle, one or two wingbacks, and halfback <a href="/wiki/Brian_Westbrook" title="Brian Westbrook">Brian Westbrook</a> or quarterback <a href="/wiki/Donovan_McNabb" title="Donovan McNabb">Donovan McNabb</a> receiving the snap.

This is used primarily to catch the defense off guard, and therefore force the other team to choose between wasting a time out or defending against a formation they had never faced. There are many variations of this formation with really the only common thread being that, rather than lining up "under center", the quarterback is lined up a few yards behind with RBs on either side of him (similar to a modern <a href="/wiki/Shotgun_formation" title="Shotgun formation">shotgun formation</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title=""><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

It contained two <a href="/wiki/Tight_ends" title="Tight ends" class="mw-redirect">tight ends</a>, and 4 backs. The quarterback in this formation (called at the time a "single-wing tailback"), like today's shotgun QB, received the snap on the fly. The other 3 backs lined up on the same side of the QB in various arrangements. Also, the formation often featured an <i>unbalanced line</i> where the center (that is, the player who snapped the ball) was not strictly in the <i>center</i> of the line, but close to the weakside. The formation was originally designed as a brute-force running formation, since it had 6 players to one side of the center and only 3 on the other. Rockne's innovations with this formation involved using complicated backfield shifts and motion to confuse defenses, and adapting it as a passing formation. The single wing has recently had a renaissance of sorts with high schools; since it is so rare, its sheer novelty can make it successful.</p>

<p>The double wing, a variant of the single wing, was invented by Pop Warner in 1912. The offense is primarily a running offense using misdirection and power plays. Most double-wing plays use a motioning wing back at the start of each play.</p>
<p>A version known as the "<a href="/wiki/Wildcat_offense" title="Wildcat offense">wildcat offense</a>" uses the same plays as the double-wing offense except that it uses a direct snap to either back and allows for more passing. In this formation, the quarterback from the offensive team is generally lined up in a wide receiver position, which allows for additional flexibility; for example, an end-around might be run with the QB receiving the ball, leaving him in a good position for a downfield pass.</p>
<p>The Double Wing is often incorrectly referred to as the Wing T, which is a different formation that uses a different formation of the backs. The Double Wing is used mostly at a high school level, although some colleges run a similar offense out of the flexbone, but usually focus more on option runs. The Double Wing usually puts a wing back in motion at the beginning of the play, and the defense can sometimes pick up on this and use that to know where the play is going, so the Double Wing uses counters where the back that doesn't go in motion gets the ball. Also, the double wing can be set into different formations, such as the Maryland I, to take away the pre-snap key on the wing back, yet still run all the plays effectively.</p>

Typical Shotgun formation</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The modern descendant of the Single Wing. The quarterback lines up about five yards behind the center, in order to allow a better view of the defense and more time to get a pass off. The shotgun can distribute its 3 other backs and 2 ends any number of ways, but most commonly employs one <a href="/wiki/Running_back" title="Running back">running back</a>, lined up next to the QB, one tight end and three wide receivers. This formation is most commonly used for passing but the quarterback can also hand it off to a running back or run himself.

Chris Ault's "Pistol" formation</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This offense was originated by Chris Ault of The <a href="/wiki/University_of_Nevada,_Reno" title="University of Nevada, Reno">University of Nevada</a> Wolf Pack. It is essentially a shotgun variation, with the <a href="/wiki/Quarterback" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> lined up closer than in standard shotgun (normally 3 to 4 yards behind center), and a <a href="/wiki/Running_back" title="Running back">running back</a> lined up behind, rather than next to, the QB (normally at 3 to 4 yards behind quarterback).</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Pistol_formation" title="Pistol formation" class="mw-redirect">Pistol formation</a> adds the dimension of a running game with the halfback being in a singleback position. This has disrupted the timing of some defenses with the way the quarterback hands the ball off to the halfback. This also allows the smaller halfbacks to hide behind the offensive line, causing opposing linebackers and pass-rushing defensive linemen to play more conservatively. The Pistol can also feature the option play. With this offense, the quarterback has the ability to get a better look past the offensive line and at the defense. Pistol formations have gained some popularity in NCAA football, and in fact a variant of this offense was used by the 2008 BCS National Champs, LSU.</p>
<p>In 2008, the <a href="/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs" title="Kansas City Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a> began using the Pistol prominently in their offense, and are the first NFL team to do so.</p>

<p>This is a variation of the Shotgun Formation designed to easily implement running play audibles from the backfield. Instead of the quarterback lining up five yards back, he lines up four yards back. This allows a better view of the defense but is still close enough to fool the defense that it's an I formation. The Eastern Shotgun formation adds the dimension of a running game with the halfback being in a singleback position.

It consists of three running backs: a fullback lined up directly behind the quarterback, and the two halfbacks split behind the fullback. It can be run with two tight ends, one tight end and one wide receiver, or two wide receivers. It is used as a running formation for the most part. The option style of offense (where the Quarterback decides to run, handoff, or pitch the ball after the snap rather than before) is most closely associated with this formation. Notable college teams to run the Wishbone include Darrell Royal's Texas Longhorns of the 1960s, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Alabama" title="University of Alabama">Alabama</a> of the early 1970s, and <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma" title="University of Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

</div>
</div>
<p>A common formation found in colleges and high schools. In this formation, one back (the fullback) lines up behind the quarterback. Both ends are often split wide as <a href="/wiki/Wide_receivers" title="Wide receivers" class="mw-redirect">wide receivers</a>, though some variations include one or two tight ends.

</div>
<p>A formation similar to the Flexbone, though much older, is known as the "Delaware Wing-T" was created by longtime <a href="/wiki/University_of_Delaware" title="University of Delaware">University of Delaware</a> coach and NCAA Rules Committee chairman <a href="/wiki/David_Nelson" title="David Nelson">David Nelson</a>, and perfected by his successor <a href="/wiki/Tubby_Raymond" title="Tubby Raymond" class="mw-redirect">Tubby Raymond</a>. It has become a very popular offense with high schools and small colleges. It was designed at the time to be a mix between the single wing and T-formation. It took the motion and run-strength of the single wing, and the QB-under-center from the T. In this variation, there is only one wing back, with the other back lined up next to the fullback on the opposite side from the wing back. However, the Wing Back may also line up diagonally from the Tight End. He may be used as an extra blocker or a receiver. He may come in motion for running plays.</p>

<p>Also known simply as "Five-wide", a reference to the five wide receivers. In the empty backfield formation, all of the backs play near the line of scrimmage to act as extra wide receivers or tight ends. This is almost exclusively a passing formation used to spread the field, often to open up short inside routes or screen routes. It can also be run with one or two wing backs like the flexbone formation allowing a running game and the ability to run the option. The quarterback can line up either under center or in the shotgun.

<p>Also called "jumbo", "heavy", "full house" or other similar names. As the name implies, this formation is used exclusively in short-yardage situations, and especially near the goal line. This formation typically has no wide receivers, and often employs 3 tight ends and 2 running backs, or alternately 2 tight ends and 3 running backs. Often, a tight end or full back position is occupied by a player who normally plays offensive line or defensive line positions to act as extra blockers.

<p>The Emory and Henry offense dates to the 1950s (named after <a href="/wiki/Emory_and_Henry_College" title="Emory and Henry College">Emory and Henry College</a>) and features an unconventional arrangement of the offensive line. Instead of aligning all five of the ineligible receivers together to form an "interior line," only three core linemen (the center and two guards) lined up around the ball, while the two tackles split off to join the a split end and a slotback/flanker (two wide receivers) on each lateral side of the field.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title=""><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The same formation was used as part of the basis for the <a href="/wiki/A-11_offense" title="A-11 offense">A-11 offense</a>, invented in September 2007 by Kurt Bryan and Steve Humphries at <a href="/wiki/Piedmont_High_School_(California)" title="Piedmont High School (California)">Piedmont High School</a> in California. The offense exploited a loophole in the high school football rule books by running from what is technically considered a "scrimmage kick;" two quarterbacks are positioned seven yards behind the line of scrimmage, while the other nine players (wearing numbers that make them appear to be eligible receivers) in "Emory &amp; Henry" or similar formations. While only four of the receivers are eligible during any given play, the formation allows the eligible and ineligible receivers to be interchanged frequently and makes it difficult to discern between eligible and ineligible receivers.</p>
<p>These systems have been adapted for many years as gimmicks for punt teams, as well as for struggling offenses who have an abundance of skill position players but lacked linemen. The A-11 received a great deal of media attention from the likes of American Football Monthly, ESPN, Sports Illustrated, Salon.com and others, but it was never legal at the NCAA and NFL levels. In February 2009, the loophole allowing the A-11 as an every-down offense was formally closed by the National High School Football Federation leaving its future in limbo.</p>

<p>Rules regarding defensive formations are not as complex as their offensive counterparts. The defense may line up anywhere on its side of the neutral zone, and players are free to move at any time before the snap, but all defensive players must remain on their side of the neutral zone (defined as the width of the ball) before the snap. If they line up on the wrong side of the line, the offending player(s) are <a href="/wiki/Offsides" title="Offsides" class="mw-redirect">offsides</a>.</p>
<p>The three basic defensive positions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Defensive_lineman" title="Defensive lineman" class="mw-redirect">Defensive lineman</a> (DL): Linemen play at the line of scrimmage, directly across from the offensive line. They are categorized as <i>defensive tackles</i> (DT) or <i>defensive ends</i> (DE). The 4-3 defense has 2 tackles and 2 ends; the 3-4 defense has 2 ends and 1 tackle, who is sometimes called a <i>nose tackle</i> (NT) to indicate the 3-4. Tackles line up inside and rely on power to stop the run, while ends line up outside and are faster and more athletic to allow them to pursue the quarterback.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Linebacker" title="Linebacker">Linebacker</a> (LB): Linebackers are positioned 2 to 4 yards behind the defensive line. The 4-3 defense has 3 linebackers, who are categorized as strong, middle and weak (SLB, MLB, WLB; also called Sam, Mike and Will). This is not an indication of strength; it instead refers to the positioning of the linebackers relative to the offense. Strong linebackers line up on the same side as the tight end, weakside away from the tight end. A 3-4 defense will use 4 linebackers, who are indicated by their side (right/left) and positioning (inside/outside).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Defensive_back" title="Defensive back">Defensive back</a> (DB): Defensive backs can include <i>cornerbacks</i> (CB), a <i>strong safety</i> (SS, lines up on same side as tight end) and a <i>free safety</i> (FS, so called because they are "free" to roam where needed). Cornerbacks are almost always responsible for defending receivers against the pass. Safeties often defend receivers as well, but they are usually positioned in the center of the field to be prepared to stop the run as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two terms often heard in referring to defensive formations are "the box" and "the secondary". The box is defined as an area on the defensive side of the ball, within 5 yards of the <a href="/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage" title="Line of scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a> and framed by the offensive tackles. This area is most commonly occupied by defensive linemen and linebackers. The secondary can refer to the defensive backs as a group, or to the area behind the linebackers usually occupied by defensive backs. The two standard NFL defenses, the 4-3 and the 3-4, have 7 players in the box; sometimes the phrase "8 in the box" will be used to indicate that one of the safeties has moved into the box to defend against the run.</p>

<p>This is the base defense for most teams. It consists of four defensive linemen, three linebackers, and four defensive backs (two safeties, two corners). Against two-receiver offensive sets, this formation is effective against the run and the pass. In the 4-3, the linemen tend to line up in the gaps between the offensive line. On passing downs, the Mike (middle linebacker) is often responsible to cover any running backs, the Sam (strong-side linebacker) covers the Tight End, and the Will (weak-side linebacker) either covers a back or "blitzes" in an attempt to "sack" the quarterback.

<p>This is the base defense of some teams. It consists of three defensive linemen, four linebackers, and four defensive backs (two safeties, two corners). The advantage is that while 4 players still usually rush the line, the quarterback can be less sure of which of the 4 linebackers will join the 3 linemen. This formation sacrifices some size (of linemen) for speed (of linebackers), but coaches choosing to utilize this formation as their base defense typically choose larger players in the front 7 to make up for the shortage of size. In this formation, the single tackle usually lines up directly over the "nose" of the ball, and is often called the "<a href="/wiki/Nose_tackle" title="Nose tackle">nose tackle</a>". In this formation, the linemen often line up directly in front of the offensive line, while the linebackers "shoot the gaps".</p>

<p>In this variation of the 3-4, known also as the "3-4 eagle", the nose tackle is removed from play and in his place is an extra linebacker, which lines up on the line where the nose tackle would be, sometimes slightly behind where the nose tackle would be. It allows defenses more flexibility in man to man coverages and zone blitzes. It was created by Los Angels Rams defensive coordinate Fritz Shurmur, and evolved from <a href="/wiki/Buddy_Ryan" title="Buddy Ryan">Buddy Ryan</a>'s 46 defense. Shurmur created the defense in part to take advantage of the pass rush abilities of <a href="/wiki/Kevin_Greene" title="Kevin Greene">Kevin Greene</a>, a defensive end sized linebacker.

This was accomplished by moving a safety up into the "box" instead of a fourth linebacker. The '46' refers not to any lineman/linebacker orientation but was the jersey number of <a href="/wiki/Doug_Plank" title="Doug Plank">Doug Plank</a>, the player <a href="/wiki/Buddy_Ryan" title="Buddy Ryan">Buddy Ryan</a> first used in this role at Chicago. The other feature of the 46 was the placement of both "outside" linebackers on the same side of the formation, with the defensive line shifted the opposite way. This defense was the philosophical equivalent of the "Notre Dame Box" offense devised by Knute Rockne in the 1930s, in that it used an unbalanced field and complex pre-snap motion to confuse the opposing offense. Chicago rode this defense into a 15-1 season in 1985, culminating in a 46-10 win over <a href="/wiki/New_England_Patriots" title="New England Patriots">New England</a> in <a href="/wiki/Super_Bowl_XX" title="Super Bowl XX">Super Bowl XX</a>.</p>

<p>While the original Nickel defense utilized 5 defensive backs in conjunction with a 4 man rush, and but 2 linebackers, modern definition calls any formation that utilizes 5 defensive backs (from nickel = 5 cent piece) a Nickel defense. The Nickel defense originated as an innovation of Philadelphia Eagles defensive coach Jerry Williams in 1960 as a measure to defend star tight end <a href="/wiki/Mike_Ditka" title="Mike Ditka">Mike Ditka</a> of the Chicago Bears. The Nickel defense was later plagiarized by then Chicago Bear's assistant George Allen who came up with the name "nickel" and later marketed the idea as his own <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title=""><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>. The Nickel coverage scheme is often used when the offense is using an additional wide-receiver as it matches an extra Corner back against the extra receiver. The extra Corner is often called a <a href="/wiki/Nickelback_(position)" title="Nickelback (position)" class="mw-redirect">nickelback</a>. Some variations use an extra Strong Safety instead of an extra Corner. Strong Safeties are often the more physical of the Safeties, often resembling Linebackers, so a Nickel with the extra Safety can be more effective against the run than one with an extra Corner. The Nickel formation comes in several varieties:</p>

<p>Any defense consisting of seven (quarter) or eight (half dollar) defensive backs. The seventh defensive back is often an extra safety, and this defense is used in extreme passing situations (such as to defend against a <a href="/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass" title="Hail Mary pass">Hail Mary pass</a>). It is occasionally referred to as the <b>prevent defense</b> because of its use in preventing desperation plays. The cornerbacks and safeties in a prevent defense usually make a point in a prevent defense of defending the goal line at the expense of receivers in the middle of the field, thus making the formation susceptible to running plays and short passes.</p>
<p>The quarter formations are run from a 3-1-7 or a 4-0-7 in most instances; the <a href="/wiki/New_England_Patriots" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a> have used an 0-4-7 in some instances with no down linemen. Half dollar defenses are almost always run from a 3-0-8 formation. The eighth defensive back in this case is usually a <a href="/wiki/Wide_receiver" title="Wide receiver">wide receiver</a> from the offense; this is usually because the offensive players would be better than the defensive roster depth at that point, and the wide receiver's pass catching skills would come in handy in some situation.</p>
<p>Unlike other formations, the extra safety is <i><b>NOT</b></i> referred to as a quarterback or halfback, for obvious reasons, but rather simply as a <a href="/wiki/Defensive_back" title="Defensive back">defensive back</a> or a safety.</p>

<p>Defense used on the goal line or in short yardage situations where the entire defense lines up close to the line of scrimmage in an attempt to stop an expected running play. It is usually used to counter a Goal Line offense. Since there is not more than 10-11 yards of field left, the safeties can be pulled for more linemen or linebackers.</p>

<p>Clearly, the permutations are endless, bound only by the individual and collective abilities of a defensive unit. More extreme formations may be called for when a coach feels that his team is at a particular disadvantage due to personnel matchups. For example, Coach <a href="/wiki/Eric_Mangini" title="Eric Mangini">Eric Mangini</a> of the New York Jets has employed an interesting scheme that involves 1 defensive lineman and 6 linebackers serving as the front seven. Prior to the snap, only the lineman assumes a three-point stance, ready to rush the passer. The 6 linebackers, meanwhile, "rove" up and down the line of scrimmage, attempting to confuse the quarterback as to whether they will rush, drop into coverage, or even bring the blitz. This defense, combined with poor weather conditions, did serve to improve the Jets' pass rush against a normally reliable Patriots o-line, limiting Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady to just 14/27 passing, with 0 TDs and 1 INT, during a December 16, 2007 contest, but proved ineffective in stopping the Patriots' running attack.</p>

<p>Most field goals feature nine offensive linemen (seven on the line, both ends in the tight end position, with two extra slightly off the line of scrimmage), a place holder who kneels 7 yards behind the line of scrimmage, and a kicker.</p>
<p>Kickoff formations are usually in a straight line, with ten players (nine if a placeholder is used on the kickoff) lined up across the field several yards behind the ball. Many leagues require that at least four players be on each side of the kicker at the time of a kick; prior to this, an <a href="/wiki/Onside_kick" title="Onside kick">onside kick</a> formation often had all ten of the other players on one side of the kicker.</p>
<p>Kick return formations vary; in most situations, an <a href="/wiki/Association_football" title="Association football">association football</a>-like formation is used, with eleven players staggered throughout the field including a kick returner or two back to receive a deep kick. To defend punts, the defensive line usually uses a man-on-man system with seven defensive linemen, two cornerbacks, a linebacker and a kick returner. They may choose to attempt to block the punt, or drop back to block the receiver.</p>

<p>A special formation is used at the end of a game, when a team has a lead and simply needs to run out the clock to win the game. The "<a href="/wiki/Quarterback_kneel" title="Quarterback kneel">kneel</a>" or "victory" formation was developed in the <a href="/wiki/1978_NFL_season" title="1978 NFL season">1978 NFL season</a> after a botched play led to what is known today as <a href="/wiki/The_Miracle_at_the_Meadowlands" title="The Miracle at the Meadowlands">The Miracle at the Meadowlands</a>. This formation is intended for one purpose: to allow the quarterback to safely down the ball without losing control, preventing the defense from recovering and advancing the ball to the end zone. The formation features several stop-gaps in the event the quarterback does lose the ball: a seven-man line, the quarterback, two upbacks (running backs) immediately behind him, one at each side in the event he fumbles, and a fast player (usually a wide receiver or cornerback) several yards back as a last resort in case the defense recovers and is able to advance the ball.<br clear="all" /></p>

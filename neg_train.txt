this picture started out with good intentions bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility and shue is cute as usual in her role it all falls apart after that it s your typical hollywood thriller now filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore minus any kind of humour wit or soul in other words don t waste your time watching this get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead also starring leonard nimoy now that was good and hg wells is well served unlike with this mess 
 br br i was very curious to see this film after having heard that it was clever and witty i had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom i felt br br the idea behind the film would have been acceptable depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience what made me dislike the whole film were two things br br first of all the film was so down to earth that it looked as if by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day to day basis it became itself ordinary and dull br br secondly the overall sloppiness of the production with dialogues that were barely understandable br br too bad 
it is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on imdb because i would not have hesitated in fact i would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars br br i like many others bought this film thinking that because it has michael madsen in it it could be good no chance this film was shocking imagine a movie length the bold and the beautiful well primal instinct did not even come close to that good and i had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length the bold and the beautiful br br michael madsen how could you do this to us the worst part is i didn t fast forward a bit i was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film br br where do i start  directing zero stars screenplay zero stars acting zero stars cinematography zero stars digital effects zero stars production design zero stars make up zero stars casting zero stars editing zero stars trailer half a star graphic design half a star dvd menu half a star br br however i think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is so for that reason i am happy that i saw this film just so that i have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list 
i ve come to realise from watching euro horror especially films made by cult luminary jess franco that you can t expect a plot that makes much sense however franco has gone overboard with this film and despite a surreal atmosphere and the film s reputation as one of the director s best succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film i ve got to admit that i saw the american cut version which runs at about 76 minutes but unless it was just the logic that was cut i m sure the longer european version is just as boring the plot has something to do with a woman marauding around practicing s m and talking rubbish and it s all really boring there s no gore and the sex is dull and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film i had difficulty making it all the way to the end i have to say that the locations look good and franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere but the positive elements end there jess franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films but this looks like it was one he made for the money and overall i recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director s more interesting works 
twenty years ago the five years old boy michael hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later on the present days michael invites his girlfriend peg and his best friends chris jennifer lisa ann ned mitch maldive and trish to spend the halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm he asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his indian friend crow they would perform an ancient indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy morty that would eliminate their fears forever the greatest fear of michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and morty turns into his father killing his friends br br the fear resurrection is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows but in a messy screenplay full of clichés there are some exaggerated performances like for example ms betsy palmer others very weak but in general the acting is good unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live further in spite of being surrounded by close friends the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies the low pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation in the very end michael shows a charm that his father was interested that i have not noticed along the story i do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the dvd released in brazil with 87 minutes running time the special effects are very reasonable for a b movie my vote is four br br title fear 2 uma noite de halloween 
 okay maybe not all of it lured by the false promise of bikini clad women on the movie s cover but the horror the horror  whatever you do do not watch this movie gouge out your eyes repeatedly bash your skull in do what it takes never again never forget br br 
this movie is so bad i knew how it ends right after this little girl killed the first person very bad acting very bad plot very bad movie br br do yourself a favour and don t watch it 1 10
ugh what can i say other than ugh i rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original vampires this movie could not have been any lamer lacking not only in plot but the acting is atrocious combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch many times i questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark here s a sampling of the lamer aspects br br spoilers br br professional slayer insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night he wakes up to a woman crying sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere he immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance she goes from crying to seducing him and he lets it happen with obvious results br br one of the main characters is zoe was bitten by a vampire but as long as she takes these experimental pills she got in mexico city she s fine although her body temperature is below room temperature br br guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires hero leaves the next day he then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left br br avoid this movie 
artemesia takes the usual story about the art world eg you can t paint that but i want to and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film well interesting but not remarkable br br the story is about one of the first female painters around artemesia who course is fiercely independent but just can t stop thinking of men and their bodies for artistic purposes of course she soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist but soon tutoring becomes much more then art and soon after that scandal erupts funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft porn fantasy i mean was artemesia that much of a man hungry person also it s quite funny when she s insisting that she paints for herself yet falls for the first person she sees br br actually the story itself is quite fascinating and it ends with a trial which i always love but i wasn t too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn t fall for i woulda gone for the young fisherman p
the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title br br i honestly didn t like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i don t get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however it s visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs monotonic scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noises br br the movie s storyline is very simple most of what s going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts br br i will say openly that this movie didn t meet my expetations a tiny bit 
 let me count the ways br br 1 a title only remake that pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook br br 2 a plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic br br 3 a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills br br 4 a pg 13 rating that insures no gore violence or sex br br 5 a villain that is not frightening or even mysterious br br 6 a cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn t possibly care about them br br 7 a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere br br 8 a script of dialog that s beyond poor it s mind numbing br br 9 a series of cardboard performances br br 10 a completely inept teen targeted slasher remake that s not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination or even to show a puddle of blood br br it s a no brainer horror fans save your money br br bomb out of  
i only today picked this up at the 99 cents only store today and i still think i got ripped off dream to believe is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and 1 is just too freakin expensive for this this film is probably only notable for 2 things 1 it has a young keanu reeves and 2 it s directed by paul lynch the man who also did promo night now onto the movie br br it s about a girl named robin who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father s life so the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named tommy robin when not in training works part time along with her mother and stepsister at a laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather eventually she is chosen to compete br br overall keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star and it s also not one of the worst movies ever but still far from good the dvd itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old vhs and towards the end the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over it fades to black even though sound can still be heard so this can probably be passed as a bootleg the dvd artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of keanu and olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie as it s also not in the movie itself so the cover s obviously photoshopped in any case avoid at all costs unless you re a keanu fanatic i probably won t be hanging to it any longer i m probably gonna give it to the cinema snob who s a great yt critic btw hey if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight feel free to donate to him to keep his show running 
i am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course eddie murphy i think this was his first movie since beverly hills cop so at the time he was hot considering that one made over two hundred million and it was r and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular i have never been a big eddie murphy fan so that is probably another reason i didn t care for it much at all this one has eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids he must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril the plot is very bad but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects i had seen better stuff done in the 70 s than some of the stuff this one offers ray harryhausen did better stuff still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of eddie unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the raiders of the lost ark type scenes i guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect but to me it just did not work 
 the return of chandu is notable if one can say that for the casting of bela lugosi as the hero rather than the villain why he even gets the girl br br the story as such involves the black magic cult of ubasti trying to capture the last egyptian princess nadji and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like nadji lugosi as chandu who possesses magical powers tries to thwart the villains br br director ray taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage fans of king kong will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep kong at bay in several scenes the acting is for the most part awful the actor who plays the high priest for example uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies the less said about the others the better br br it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career because he was still a bankable star at universal at this time maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl who knows as his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather than the exception br br 
this is the biggest insult to tmnt ever fortunantely officially venus does not exist in canon tmnt there will never be a female turtle this took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own once gone no more the biggest mistake was crossing over power rangers to tmnt with a horrible episode the turtle s voices were wrong and they all acted out of character they could have done such a better job better designs and animatronics and no venus br br don t bother with this people it s cringe worthy material the lip flap was slow and unnatural looking they totally disrespected shredder the main baddie some dragonlord dude was corny the turtles looked corny with things hanging off their bodies what s with the thing around raph s thigh the silly looking sculpted plastrons br br if they looked normal acted in character and got rid of venus got rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds and better writing it could have been good 
leave it to paul sex on the brain verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the invisible man story if he d direct a pokemon film i m sure he d turn it into some massive orgy of sorts i don t mind sex or even sleaze on film but frankly it s obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn t see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it it s a shame because it could have been good if the film didn t spend so much time having an invisible kevin bacon grope women br br the game cast of actors does what it can with the one note cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them including william devane who is totally wasted here br br but then what could i have expected from the director of showgirls which btw is much more entertaining than this stilted bad film 
following the success of paris je t aime a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york unlike the original film the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly by the time you think are getting into a story it s over in too many cases and the often start up and stop and then begin again with the stories woven together as a result there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure br br sadly however while paris je t aime was hit or miss most of new york i love you was miss the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet and often quite terrible it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so now understand it was good quality music but its somber tone really really made me feel like cutting my wrists among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant and the crotchety old couple this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much and i really wanted to love this film i respected what they tried but simply didn t like it very much br br by the way and this is not really a complaint but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film for a recent film that was unusual in our more anti smoking culture br br also if you get the dvd there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film one consists of kevin bacon eating a hotdog and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world including a very unhappy couple 
there are so many puns to play on the title of the spectacularly bad valentine that i don t know where to begin i will say this though here is a movie that makes me long for the complexity of the valentine cards we used to give out in elementary school you know the ones with batman exclaiming you re a super crime fighting valentine br br valentine is a slasher movie without the slightest hint of irony one of the few horror movies in recent years that ignores the influence of scream the villain is omniscient and nigh invulnerable the heroes are easily scared when people run around corners and grab them by the shoulders screaming heyijustleftmycoatbehind the score is more overbearing than norman bates mother br br the flimsy plot follows several childhood friends now grown up and extremely curvaceous since the film gives them nothing else to do they stand around and wait until a masked stalker kills them one by one this stalker appears to be former nerd jeremy melton who was constantly rejected by women and beaten by men in high school with valentine s day approaching the women begin receiving scary cards foretelling their doom melton seems like the obvious suspect only problem is as numerous characters warns in thirteen years melton could have changed his appearance to look buff and handsome so everyone is a suspect br br here s problem one in order to have any sense of suspense while watching valentine you have to accept a reality in which a high school nerd is capable of becoming david boreanaz nerds don t turn into angel when they grown up they turn into older balder nerds he s not a terrible actor but the script by no less than four writers gives him and the rest of the cast nothing to do but scream and make out denise richards is especially exploited most shamefully in the blatant excuse to get her in a bathing suit just before a crucial suspense scene note to self always bring a bathing suit to a valentine s day party just because it s february doesn t mean you might not feel like taking a little dip br br the slasher in valentine dresses in head to toe black with a cherub s mask here s problem number two the filmmakers clearly thought this would be a disturbing image to have on the head of someone who s whacking people in the face with hot irons plain and simple it s not instead it just made me wonder how a guy with a mask that covers his entire face including his eyes and ears can move so stealthily without bumping his shins on chairs or tables then again given the things the cupid killer does maybe he can teleport and his eyes are on his hands br br not only is the movie bad it isn t even sure who the killer is the final twist is more huh than hah when you re not scratching your head you re yawning then groaning then searching for the nearest exit do not watch this movie even if you re alone on valentine s day find something anything else to do you ll be glad you did 
 i am curious yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile it doesn t matter what one s political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc 17 that isn t true i ve seen r rated films with male nudity granted they only offer some fleeting views but where are the r rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia nowhere because they don t exist the same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny in which we re treated to the site of vincent gallo s throbbing johnson but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny before crying double standard in matters of nudity the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude and the same cannot be said for a man in fact you generally won t see female genitals in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica this alleged double standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women s bodies 
i thought this was a very clunky uninvolving version of a famous australian story heath ledger and orlando bloom were very good in their roles and gave their characters some personality but the whole thing felt forced and mechanical br br the beginning could have been a lot more involving perhaps starting with a shootout and then flashing back for a recap of how they got there or that sort of thing and i felt like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted like a very bad tv soap br br i was really looking forward to this movie and hoping for something a lot better the only thing i can say in its favour is that it beats the mick jagger version but not by much 
was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama this film starts with a light hearted banter between three women fine it moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man fine there are a few antics between them fine but when the plot thickens and finally becomes black i started to wonder whether i had misinterpreted the first part of the movie it continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original light hearted banter but by now it s too late it s hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing truly a lesson of how not to make films difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work and the box office proved it to be a real flop because i d never heard of this film until this weekend 
this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original cartoon br br there s this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are it s atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn t bother me so much so that i didn t even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all it s miserably forgettable br br the only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja 
i saw this at the premiere in melbourne br br it is shallow two dimensional unaffecting and hard to believe given the subject matter boring the actors are passable but they didn t have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script for those who might have worried that ned kelly would be over intellectualised you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards however it doesn t work as a popcorn film either its pacing is too off kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner br br i very much doubt gregor jordan could sit back and say to himself this is the best i could have done with the material br br ned kelly is a fascinating figure and equally so is the national response to him possibly folk genius possibly class warrior possibly psychopath and probably all these things he has dominated australian true mythology for over 120 years once again his story has failed miserably on the big screen br br such is life 
i get to the cinema every week or so and regularly check out this site but never before have i felt compelled to comment on a film br br to my all time list of shockingly bad films last man standing spawn the bone collector i can now add the drivel that was hollow man br br from the awful opening titles a ridiculously over long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti through to the insulting finale a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema this film is dismal and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end br br this isn t just my opinion it was that of my friends and everyone around us when large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller its clear that the film is hopeless br br not only that it was sick too the director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked b movie it s difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man because the extent of the invisible man s forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke s mind if made invisible but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved it hardly makes entertaining cinema br br br br get past the films sick exterior and things are even worse whilst kevin bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as hollow man the rest of them perhaps handicapped by a dire script do an even better job of being hollow cast one long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man he s finally snapped shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion this is par for the course and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting they pad their way through the lab corridors terrified guns poised but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague the lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he s insulted and abused her and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts even after he drowns the pentagon chief he drowned in his pool last night reports the same female spectacularly failing to put two and two together br br the script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue and the rest is just an a z of film cliches which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end br br the eureka moment at the computer the female undressing at the window the looped security video the list really is endless the predictable disregard for strength in numbers the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices the almost dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes the falling lift which just stops before hitting them and more than anything else the immortality of the bad guy br br the invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame thrower electrocuted whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors and then having apparently survived the explosion fireball and total destruction of the labs has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches br br that this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one which should be avoided at all costs 
a film with very little positive to say for it br br firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama br br besides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again i lost count of how many times i had seen that field at night or that bit of cracked earth br br it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don t know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it s fine we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre beth has a key to a warehouse of books there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie much later in fact too late br br and on the point of the acre horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary and also if they re meant to be an acre big then make them so br br there is also a frightening lack of reasonability as beth suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on medication br br with the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene bad plinky plonk horror music fails to add atmosphere br br often bad films can be amusing but not the empty acre which is just bad 
early film directed by d w griffith it features a gloriously happy king and his queen but wait when the king leaves the scene his queen makes music with the palace s minstrel when the king discovers the lovers he decides to enact a horrific edgar allen poe type revenge it s difficult to believe the lovers can t hear those plotting against them although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy and quiet the sets make the sealed room look very staged the performances are okay and the story is easy to follow br br  the sealed room d w griffith arthur v johnson henry b walthall marion leonard
this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there is absolutely no storyline the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching in the whole movie fredi doesn t ask himself once how he came from a plane to middle earth there are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny e g gandalf is called almghandi sam is called pupsi  and so on i didn t even smile once during the whole movie the gags seem like they were made by people whose iq is negative if you laugh when someone s coat is trapped in the door then this movie is perhaps for you another funny scene they try to guess the code word for a closed door and the code word is dung so if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie for everybody else go to youtube and watch lord of the weed it s a lot lot more fun 
wow br br i picked this up at the local wal mart after reading online that it had been released early i ve been following this online for some time and just had to buy the film br br wow br br i guess the thing that really struck me was the editing or lack thereof time and again characters are shown walking and walking and walking i am not an editor but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b there is no need to show almost the entire journey wow br br i actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this they seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy depending on what action was to be added at a later date br br wow br br why it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me even ilm still employs miniatures sometimes one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities including london at times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera in one shot in london there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator s brother not since gettysburg have i seen such a fake piece of facial hair br br wow br br why timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me it is a turkey plain and simple on the plus side it has provided some of the most genuine laugh out loud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while 
hail bollywood and men directors br br really this is the ultimate limit in utter sacrifice made by indian woman br br viewing the current state of affairs in india where the wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive about their husbands the directors also can be called uncle scars came up with a very new concept on how both the kept and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between themselves including the spermikins br br story line married couple very happy but accidentally a mishap happens and wife has a miscarriage lost the foetus along with the capacity of ever becoming a mother br br now in in india the in laws usually drive away the daughter in law if she fails to give them an heir so the wife hits upon a major plan surrogate mother but the scientists intervened sure artificial insemination no said the artist  neighbourhood will come to know that the daughter in law is barren so they are going for surrogate mother br br neighbours society gosh the same ones who watch fashion tv day and night watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40 al in bras and panties well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making br br so the wife sends away her husband to a beer bar where girls are dancing on the stage all mostly uneducated and illiterate but men love such women as they can satisfy their egos a lot br br he hires the lead dancer in the pub asks her to bear his baby in exchange for money she agrees she comes home becomes pregnant wife and kept both co exist in the same house in the mean time the prostitute also gets a taste of household life so much caring people around she misses them all and cries silently in the mean time no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is roaming around with a pillow beneath her petticoat  the mother or other elderly people never took her for check ups nor did they try to feel the baby s movements in the womb

well as goethe once said there really isn t any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on something that has had a great effect la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what s been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film certainly should be dissuaded from watching it to express a purely subjective judgement however i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people don t watch it it s a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i don t mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on and if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i don t see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree of course because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree because we see the least of her alexandre s affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value of course but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre léaud is most likely not even acting and that with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray he really was just reproducing word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he along with the director eustache had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100 of the film it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow worthless and despicable post 68 milieu what made however this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman sleeping with another and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third well i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog eat dog world he s chosen to create for himself what i can t however in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty as i say if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre veronika and marie three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching the problem however is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings emotional capabilities this latter idea however is arrant and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated miserable and alone or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la maman et la putain if you re historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post 68 parisian milieu which was probably unfortunately not restricted to just a few particularly anti social types like these but please don t make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have 
this film was probably inspired by godard s masculin féminin and i urge you to see that film instead br br the film has two strong elements and those are the realistic acting the impressive undeservedly good photo apart from that what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film it s unattractive comparing to godard s film intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity without going too far on this subject i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish society br br a movie of its time and place 2 10 
if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp or john wayne as a communist spy then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle s farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie br br this film is so stupid that it isn t even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boone s refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won t kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the screen consummation of their love it s sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don t have guns br br the story is pointless even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm br br april love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan 9 from outer space 
i ve seen my fair share of badly thought out endings and final twists to films but i don t recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did br br the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would surprise us all  and it did but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped i was left feeling surprised that connery harris fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey individually or collectively br br the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall but once the twist was revealed the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable the underlying motive for revenge was ill conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far fetched what s worse is that once the twist was revealed the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable br br harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance even if the movie ain t that great so all in all it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema 
my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke little did we realize the joke was on her for paying 1 for it while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles these included br br 1 drinking bleach 2 rubbing sand in my eyes 3 writing a letter to brad sykes and garrett clancy 4 re enacting the american civil war 5 tax returns 6 gcse maths 7 sex with an old lady br br garrett clancy aka sgt ben draper wrote this the guy couldn t even dig a hole properly the best ting he did was kick a door down this was the worst film i have ever seen and i ve seen white noise the light never has a film had so many mistakes in it my girlfriend left it here so now i live with the shame of owning this piece of crap br br news just in owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself fact br br do not watch
this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse retire the trophy and give it to these people  there s just no comparison br br even three days after watching this i cannot believe how insanely horrific this movie is was its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence br br this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good it s an embarrassment i don t know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i don t know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies br br that being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack 3 i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are bad br br but this  this crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first 5 minutes before br br every cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audience br br but  and let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of drain o or i will do it for him br br if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this br br stop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society please stop now 
 the domino principle is without question one of the worst thrillers ever made hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you ll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream i give up  br br how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks br br i hope they spent their money well 
this is a movie of tired yet weirdly childish clichés there s a nazi witch master performing sf related experiments in the basement oh please br br aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright not having any expectations beforehand i am left with an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape like face who doesn t seem to know how to act said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death br br camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame 
a young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he won t turn out like his father all the stock characters are in place the nice couple the funny guy the tough hood the smart girl the nerd and two no personality blondes it all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life and kills people i knew i was in trouble when after a great opening scene we jump to 20 years later all bad horror movies do that br br the dialogue is atrocious the acting is bad and the killings are stupid and or unimaginative my favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he s fully dressed a real bad stupid incoherent horror film avoid at all costs 
i rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable judge for yourself be warned the following will not only give away the plot but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie br br a computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors when the code in the form of light enters the eye it can access the electrical system of your body what it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the calcium after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk br br this virus is very intelligent when it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device operated by hands the device is set on a very high voltage which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert s head the virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an atm fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc s in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water br br oh dear 
ok its not the best film i ve ever seen but at the same time i ve been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the way br br and jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name calling br br overall the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it 
nine minutes of psychedelic pulsating often symmetric abstract images are enough to drive anyone crazy i did spot a full frame eye at the start and later some birds silhouetted against other colors it was just not my cup of tea it s about 8½ minutes too long 
when converting a book to film it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the author s intended tone or conveyed concepts rather than ignoring the author altogether while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewart s children it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good enriching strengthening experiences of homesteading her land the book details her life on her and her husband s adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances though they lived dozens of miles apart the film however takes a standard stance for the time it was made portraying this woman s experience as harsh unforgiving and nearly pointless perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak odious landscape devoid of friends or hope don t waste your time with this movie read the book instead 
this movie was so bad i couldn t sit through it without doing something else there was no plot and no point i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian i couldn t recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining br br so how was this made is there no quality control in film watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience br br it s hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure he was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy 
bad actors bad filming choppy dialog shallow characters but then again it was a bad premise in the first place basically an 11 year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal of course the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house cash a check for 1 000 000 dollars and even foil three bumbling idiots reminiscent of the three stooges br br preston blake is an annoying obnoxious boy who decides that when written a blank check by a complete stranger he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can in other words he wanders into a bank br br hands a teller a check he makes in his printer and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his 10 speed could not catch him even when preston jumped a row of cars br br of course with every hokey adventure movie there has to be hot heroine in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston and promises another date when he turns 17 br br however the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting nor its sloppy dialog such as the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it s butt and then pick up the fur it was rather the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias macintosh to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts of course the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston who uses his 11 year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face then treat her to hamburgers finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison s from the ground our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two as they make their way to preston s limousine complete with a 1 dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on br br overall 1 10 is incredibly gracious for this film i don t see how it only has a 4 4 10 
this movie was made for tv so taking that into account i m not going to rip into it as hard as i would a feature film the script is sub par but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots whether it means to be or not the acting is mostly over the top but that is true for many lower budget movies br br the aspect of this movie that i really hated though was that 90 95 of it is shot on film but in random places there will be 5 10 seconds where the footage is shot on video you can tell because there is less contrast the colors are less vivid and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film s 24 frames per second i m not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn t have the money to shoot on film but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look br br anyway i ve definitely seen worse movies but i definitely wouldn t say that i enjoyed this movie and i can t recommend that anyone see it 
jochen hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non prejudicial infective organism br br stefan journeys from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father s scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from puccini s opera turandot which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera a police investigator louise tolliver and her companion cop follow the murders while stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father s theory he encounters a strange lad jeffrey with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects how this all come to an end is the play of the film a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders br br while tom wlaschiha jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented irit levy and kaylene parker when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero there are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of nessun dorma as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera and that seems to be the reason for making the film good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing grady harp february 06
really i can t believe that i spent 5 on this movie i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn t be that bad it had zombies in it right was i wrong to be honest the movie had it s moments i thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that buyer beware unless you are into masochism 
before starting to watch the show i ve heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting what a deception the scripts are so dumb that i am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of scoobidoo writers and what about the sfx and colors they are so extreme that it is painful to watch colors are not saturated they are over saturated like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated this show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best they are sufficient unfortunately for this show the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility 
prom night br br directed by nelson mccormick br br starring brittany snow scott porter jessica stroup and dana davis br br plot three years ago donna witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher who has a bit of a crush on her now she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends once there they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt br br pros i got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves br br an example br br everyone decides not to tell donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her has escaped from prison their reason they don t want to embarrass her in front of all her friends lol br br cons let me start off by saying i m a huge slasher fan usually i can have fun with even the bad ones i even like some pg 13 horror films tourist trap one of my favorites was originally rated pg i also enjoy poltergeist and the grudge so the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated pg 13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie br br first of all i had a big problem with the story i like slasher films that don t even have stories at least they can be entertaining this is about a teacher who falls in love with his student so he kills her entire family a few years later he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends then there were subplots that i doubt anyone cared about claire is fighting with her boyfriend she has cramps and i couldn t care less this should have been a lifetime feature not a remake of prom night br br and then  this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes i don t even care that it s not that gory some of my favorite slashers were not that gory but they still had effective murders here we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds and a closeup on a bad actor s face as he screams in agony i m sure that 10 year old girls were terrified but not me br br i also hated the characters there was donna s unrealistically sensitive boyfriend bobby and i can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life unless you are a gay male then we had donna s annoying friends claire and lisa and the token mean girl chrissy if you thought the characters in death proof were annoying try watching this movie and don t get me started on ronnie and the dj who gave me flashbacks to usher s performance in she s all that br br add to all that predictable plot turns a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material and you have quite a stinker 
what an insult to olivia d abo who plays the film s heroine robin to have keanu reeves appear so large on the box art of the film considering that she was the star i realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this long forgotten after school special but at least give the woman some credit br br despite that this has to be one of the worst teen sports themed films that i have ever seen and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie cliché from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance and in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of flashdance it includes similar dance sequences and worse yet even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny dance offs between the heroine and her antagonist the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team we saw this in trashin and rad for example in fact this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness such as the somewhat homo erotic rolling in the clothes at the salvation army with robin and her friend from the team br br nonetheless the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background to top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible she lives with her ailing mother her obnoxious sister and her careless stepfather needless to say homelife is not so appealing add to the mix a talent for gymnastics but several obstacles to joining the team and of course we can t forget that she s got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates nor that she doesn t have a steady boyfriend could this kid be any more pathetic and it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long redundant and clichéd quest to prove her worth to everyone br br but even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog it makes episodes of amazing stories look like shakespeare br br i imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor for that you might be satisfied but it is also an incredibly forced drama so caveat emptour 
well i m probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site but the good earth is one of the worst structured films i ve seen in a long time we have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended yeah ok with this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again br br well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film however the film then continues on for a whole other hour and in this remaining time its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers oh yea and the age old money is the root of all evil blah blah blah just because you know your making an epic film doesn t mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasn t even cared about through most of the film br br oh wait and the film isn t the only thing thats poorly written the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery even if they are starving at the time of this idea it still doesn t make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again br br there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography the land is shot beautifully oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say br br one last thing i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old italian paul they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarface of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian the rest are just americans being silly oh and please ms rainer that was a really nice one note performance not if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands oh i would br br the good earth is one epic waste of time if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the grapes of wrath a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets mainly because it wasn t written by a monkey 
i love these actors but they were wasted in this flick br br i can only wonder what were they thinking agreeing to this crap br br debra winger just phoned it in dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures some people thought it was deep well if you liked breaking the waves you ll probably like this too i hated both 3 10
in my book basic instinct was a perfect film it had outstanding acting on the parts of stone douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role it had marvelous photography music and the noirest noir script ever all of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get br br this sequel is the exact opposite it cannot possibly get worse bad acting and a lame script combined with totally inept direction this is really bad boring annoying the only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re enacted copy of the original these copies are so bad they make you laugh and i laughed a lot in spite of myself because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument the only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the jerry goldsmith score of bi1 michael caton jones and the half wit responsible for the script even included the there is no smoking in this room dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney away br br i am sorry i have seen this awful film that should have never been made it does damage to the original so bad is it the only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original and what concerns the human body applies to film making too there should be a law don t ever make a sequel to a perfect film 
burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions he d show up party with his friends on film and take home a big paycheck it didn t seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap br br no film epitomized this more than stroker ace which makes cannonball run look like a classic and cannonball run ii look watchable save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it s embarrassing br br if the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won t be any worse 
generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course dean martin songs problem is nicholas cage there is no chemistry between he and cher and they are the central love story cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to cage s shifting accent and out of control body language cage simply never settles into his role he tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that s what s needed in a love story cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a jimmy stewart type character cage keeps taking these roles perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn t lend itself to them though he s gotten better at it with repeated attempts he should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self 
i love movies and i ll watch any movie all the way through just to give it a chance i can finally say that i found a movie i can t watch all the way through the acting is terribly stale and monotone the cgi looks like a computer geek did it in his mother s basement with minimal software and  the long scenes of just walking  and this movie is three hours long i didn t even make it 15 minutes until i fast forwarded the dvd the scenes with the aliens are very short ummm instead of naming this war of the worlds lets name this war of the walking long distances this cost 5 million dollars to make what they spend the money on the dramatic opening song br br oh but on a positive note one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people that s hilarious not because people are dying but because when they turn to skeletons they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward br br so like i said if you are a fan of boring stale action less movies here is one for you dvd collection but i didn t write this for you i wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will hate this movie it is not worth your time or money br br i know this is by the book but the book isn t that long and i m a complete book worm nerd geek whatever but why just get the steven spielberg version it s not all that good but it s 10 times better than this br br i give this a big fat zero out of 10 
actually this flick made in 1999 has pretty good production values the actors are attractive and reasonably talented there aren t a bunch of clowns running around blasting away expending hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh nor are there wild car chases crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed br br the interiors look respectably modern architecturally and the equipment looks up to snuff well there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a 50s electronics lab and the pancake make up on the corpses cracked me up not pancake make up in the conventional sense but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin this is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student br br ah yes the virus i would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci fi horror flick i know of but i can t a computer virus that is transmitted via a television screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen gimme a break warp drives a la star trek are one thing but photons becoming viruses this is so silly the desired fright factor just isn t realizable the flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive or have a cat jump out of the closet or something because the viral thingamajig isn t doing it br br one presumes robert wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that lord oliver gave for some of his later trashy venues he needed the money no other comparison between the two should be construed however 
i don t give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized in the early years of the aids epidemic the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi monde of san francisco the city renowned for its beauty has rarely appeared uglier than in this film a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene br br while the acting and plot can t be said to be well done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss actually i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish lesbian police detective she s interesting though not necessarily convincing br br highlights the film s use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist ron athey 
i read rice s novel with interest and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths br br however i was simply appalled at this disastrous adaptation the casting was based merely on physical appearance and not acting talent the cast s embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a french accent was hilarious but not in an entertaining way i found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe and was surprised i made it to the end br br a warning to fans of the novel stay away from this one 
shecky is a god damned legend make no mistake until recently i worked for a uk hifi video retail chain running their testing department we would go through many new starters they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores now to tortu test the resolve of these new staff members we would issue them with a copy of going overboard we had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of goodmans dvd player that had this film as a free gift got round to sending their dvd player back they never failed to send shecky back also our new staff would be forced to use only going overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with br br now as to why this film is so bad where do i begin br br adam sandler who can be so so very funny as in happy gilmore or the wedding singer must have been having one hell of an off day the rest of the crew stank and what is it with billy zane his name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time and he is a decent actor crazy the production quality is absolute zero br br i would have been inclined to give this a zero if i could because they didn t even have the guts to call it by it s full name the unsinkable shecky moskowitz on release even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far sandler has come and just how low he can go 
larry buchanan yep same guy who did attack of the the eye creatures and two conspiracy movies about marilyn monroe he s to blame here br br adding onto his ever growing pile of folders left over from oliver stone s eh i grew out of it conspiracy drawer here s down on us which is the working definition of historical inaccuracy br br forget everything you thought you knew about jimi hendrix janis joplin and jim morrison says big lar cuz this is the real deal y see the three big names in rock of the 60s were killed by the government because they were subversives or counter productive to truth justice and the american way or sumpthin like that there i knew it all along br br anyway three people who look eerily like their real life shadows show that instead of their recorded deaths the good old us of a put hits out on them yep it s the truth br br man i cannot believed i watched this movie it s facts when not stretching credibility to the snapping point are ludicrous the acting makes tv commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end you deserve the twist ending you really really do i swear genius br br but like the man said rock and roll is dead long live rock and roll br br not this flick though br br no stars for down on us and that s the movie audience describing the film by the way 
i wasn t sure how to rate this movie since it was so bad it was actually very funny i m not a gackt fan by any means though he is talented despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball i always thought hyde was talented though faith is an interesting album br br but on topic here folks this movie is ridiculous it s so over the top and nonsensical it s almost like a parody of supernatural action films br br the movie has almost no plot here except it s just about vampires with gangster friends in a way this film almost reminded me of spider man 3 with how there were too many ideas which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them br br the action scenes were laughable quickly edited almost hard to understand with choreography that s so laughably bad though hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes but that s this film s only such redemption i m a sucker for good action movies but the action was horribly done though the final shootout was ok and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie br br it keeps jumping between genres not a good thing it wants to be a drama or an action flick or a horror or a romance what the hell br br if this review is making you mad why is it because gackt and hyde are your love don t fool yourself this movie is bad 
this film is awful the screenplay is bad the is script mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking this movie was shot in a dark shadowy and monochromatic style which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film greg morrisey s brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic the only highlight is sharon stone s performance as catherine tramell faithfully continued in this sequel but it isn t enough to make up for the other shortcomings the only circumstance under which a basic instinct 3 should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast 
if the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless one might well refer to ned kelly as an australian western for the people down under ned kelly was apparently a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood jesse james bonnie and clyde and butch cassidy and the sundance kid the descendant of irish immigrants kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison to get back at the government for this mistreatment kelly his brother dan and two other companions became notorious bank robbers winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country br br perhaps because we ve encountered this gentleman bandit scenario so many times in the past ned kelly feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre s stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown ned is the typical heart of gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and even then only with the deepest regret he also has the pulse of the common folk as when in the middle of a bank robbery he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it what movie on this particular subject hasn t featured a scene like that it s acts of selective generosity like this of course that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers that be and the status quo geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment there s even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers so turned on is she by the romantic derring do of the criminal lifestyle and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another br br heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging it doesn t help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film br br ned kelly might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history but as an entertainment it s just the same old story told with different accents 
i was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb i just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at a i r as it was know as back then thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and i don t have to sit through the whole thing it was more of a big party than a movie set but hey the pay was good attention to detail was not a strong point for this one but who was going to know the funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed a lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed i suppose to shave cost and time but every one was having such a good time who cared 
gene hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination it s a given of course that hackman has the proficient skills for the job br br nobody tells him anything though he s given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information that s supposed to be suspenseful instead it s annoying and boring br br hackman goes through with the mission but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up so everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don t really care br br one of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit maybe something really was lost in the translation but i tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience br br a very talented cast that had people like richard widmark candice bergen mickey rooney eli wallach and edward albert is so thoroughly wasted here it s a crime br br and we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this the fbi the cia the dea or even the irs 
while it s early to say how the series will evolve i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be there is still potential for the series however of course when i first saw voyager i thought it had potential too but was sorely disappointed my gut tells me enterprise won t be as bad as voyager however br br as for the impressions of the pilot br br the pilot had some good ideas and good themes i liked the introduction the show s opening credits were interesting with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song scott bakula is excellent in the role of captain br br where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the feel of setting out on a grand adventure the plot of the episode itself was more a generic trek story with the themes of exploration and first step towards space merely subplot and subtext were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of enterprise tos or tng the central plot didn t reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series br br the plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the action instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration they could have been the story get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it make us feel the excitement of the wind and being on the sea instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay there was way too much gunplay br br we had the feeling more that humans were the freshmen in an established school new kids on the block as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe sadly the klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them that meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological just how do two such different societies interact don t just hint about it show it br br i had to think of it more as trek with an akward crew and limited technology as opposed to the first brave steps into the unknown i wanted to see something newer and fresher the series promises to have a new concept but so far i haven t seen this new great concept br br i will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential there are some interesting characters bakula is wonderful blalock has potential the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo 11 if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme we will have a show which will create new legends br br you shoot an arrow into the air good luck capt archer br br to the producers take more risks and make us think 
wow here it finally is the action movie without action in a real low budget setting of a future seattle we find a no brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood br br there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly matrix without having the money to do it right yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot outs but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody s attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then br br and yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes br br believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get in fact it doesn t deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money 
i went into this with my hopes up by twenty minutes into the movie i couldn t have been more let down despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake i kept my hopes high that maybe just maybe someone would get it right this time around sadly prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake bad script bad direction cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror br br from beginning to end it s boring repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls we ve seen it all before and we ve seen it done a million times better then this if you go to see prom night in the theater get ready for the audience to laugh because laugh they will the laughs aren t at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny they are in response to key thrilling moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie seriously was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof the film makers missed the mark so badly here that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie which in retrospect i wish i had done not me though i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better needless to say it didn t the horror scenes are a joke not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction the script the special effects and the camera work the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it but still came out of it with a micro budget movie i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere br br this movies scary alright if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed 
i purchased this film on the cheap in a sale having read the back of the dvd case and assuming that either way i can t lose it if was rubbish then no loss if it was any good then bargain br br then i watched it br br i am normally a fan of christopher walken but in this film he commanded very little screen presence seeming not to do a whole lot even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the action in the plot seems to affect him very little and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic br br normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it s eventual conclusion br br at this point i wept br br i thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing i have ever been subjected to the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl the acting was poor all round the script and story was weak the action was even weaker and the visuals were but bluntly not all that visual to summarise there are films which are good films that are bad films that are so bad they are good films that are terrible br br and then on a whole new level is mcbain 
i was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man br br intriguing br br not i hasten to add these women are all drawn in extreme caricature not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down br br anna chancellor and imelda staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball which doesn t work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town br br and for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men sex lust in their lives i felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension the lesbian sub plot went nowhere and those smoking drinking women were very unrealistic even in the baby scene screw the baby gimme a cigarette right br br like i said a shame of a waste 4 out of 10 
i was excited to view a cataluña s film in the berlin s competition but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious too much blood too much time too much themes for nothing the spanish civil war like every war was horrible the revenge a very human behavior not pretty at all is shown in uncountable films and plays as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism but what mr villaronga try is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film s history it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film 
this movie was messed up a sequel to john carpenter s vampires this didn t add up right i m not sure that i enjoyed this much it was a little strange stick to the first vampires it s a good movie vampires los muetos wasn t a good attempt of a sequel br br 4 10
i ve always liked fred macmurray and although her career was tragically cut short i think carole lombard is fun to watch pair these two major and attractive stars together add top supporting players like jean dixon anthony quinn dorothy lamour and charles butterworth give them a romantic script team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you geta mediocre movie experience br br skid johnson and maggie meet cute during her visit to the panama canal and spend the next few weeks falling in love skid s a great trumpeter so he embarks on a musical career which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall during his climb to musical stardom he neglects maggie who later inspires him to start over after he s hit rock bottom ah yesit s the true hollywood happy ending which comes none too soon br br stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that it s difficult to watch at times the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york fred and carole try their best but the tired script and s l o w direction just don t give them a chance even the final scene in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment just doesn t ring true br br this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard however i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours 
thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey john carpenter and tommy lee wallace this movie sucks on so many levels it s pathetic the first vampires was fun but this low budget retread makes me yawn br br jon bon jovi drives around mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala antonio banderas s guitar case in desperado he picks up some lame hunters along the way and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest if you ve seen the first vampires you ve already seen this and done much better br br john carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately frankly i think he s past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic the only decent film he s done since they live is vampires everything else is complete crap right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded ghosts of mars and now this waste of celluloid where are more greats like assault on precinct 13 halloween escape from new york and the thing br br carpenter crony wallace proves he can t write his way out of a paper bag with his paper thin script packed with yawns groans and recycled gags from the original did i mention i hated every character in the movie there was not a single memorable character in the whole film how does that happen this film has nothing to recommend it not even the dvd presentation is good the menu looks awful br br by comparison jason x friday the 13th in space was a masterpiece now that is how you make a sequel and energize a franchise ladies and germs as well as create an exciting dvd menu 
i ve seen all four of the movies in this series each one strays further and further from the books this is the worst one yet my problem is that it does not follow the book it is titled after in any way the directors and producers should have named it any thing other than love s abiding joy the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters the names ages genders of the children are wrong the entire story line is no where in the book br br i find it a great disservice to janette oke her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way the music is too loud the actors are not convincing they lack emotions br br if you want a good family movie this might do it is clean don t watch it though if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book i hope that this will be the last movie from this series but i doubt it if there are more movies made i wish michael landon jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines the books are excellent and if closely followed would make excellent movies 
an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised there s a lot of talent involved here a great many talented actors directors and writers unfortunately i couldn t really enjoy this movie based on three issues i had br br first of all the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality and unfortunately some of them clash with the others br br secondly several segments feel underdeveloped to me like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition i m not talking about happy endings here but rather they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in br br last but not least i did not feel new york and its inhabitants were properly portrayed br br what you re left with is high brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied 
i agree with most of the columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past and that is the disturbing point because columbo is no ordinary detective br br there are two parts in this film that left me intriguing first i can t figure out the title of this movie it is misleading maybe a better title would ve been the vanishing bride or something similar second columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason why he does it br br i don t feel betrayed just disappointed i m glad peter falk went back to the usual columbo br br 
this is one of the dumbest films i ve ever seen it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them all br br there s not a single good line or character in the whole mess if there was a plot it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes there s nothing good to say so ill say nothing i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released does somebody somewhere not at some stage think oh my god this really is a load of shite and call it a day its crap like this that has people downloading illegally the trailer looks like a completely different film at least if you have download it you haven t wasted your time or money don t waste your time this is painful 
i have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to br br having just watched it a few hours ago i am struggling to remember a thing about it br br from what i remember it s main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from friday the 13th and are stalked by plank of wood man br br some people die the film ends i am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as i want compensation for the missing time in my life br br i will pay u 1 to take this film off my hands oh wait i already gave it away to a friend 
when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as co stars you expect to find a well done horror movie but this was actually quite different representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction karloff and lugosi both play scientists competitors to an extent until rukh wins benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory the science here was to say the least a bit rough around the edges but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth several thousand million years ago in that pre historic time a huge meteorite slammed into africa leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call radium x which can heal and destroy a large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in africa on a search for the meteorite deposits which rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well br br karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here lugosi pulls off a role in which he s the good guy pretty well although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing especially during the scenes set in africa the story also plodded along a bit and while it held my attention it didn t captivate me given that this is really a sci fi rather than a horror flick and that sci fi was in its very early stages i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack it was ok nothing more but also nothing less than that 4 10
this is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of jules verne s mysterious island the sound editing is pretty bad you hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time this is an amateur film with actors from boston and shot around new hampshire for those living in new engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital w this film is full of flaws you get to hear the director s voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress ok now stand up as for the other characters there is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien the alien guy talks with a deep voice when he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor s voice as for the special effects man this was brett piper s early work for crying out loud the creatures are good but the animation is jerky really jerky sort of like karl zeman animation in journey to beginning of time the special effects are imaginative thge music is good bottom line this film makes equinox or planet of the dinosaurs look like a ray harryhausen epic did you know mysterious planet was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget a must watch for aspiring film makers 
i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people the one who wrote the brilliant a double life and the funny born yesterday and co wrote such excellent screenplays as adam s rib and pat and mike with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote and or directed such tiresome sad drivel as bachelor mother some kind of a nut and this the cast tries but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated the script sinks to it s nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which janssen s character tests drivas s character to make sure he s not gay an ugly sequence but sadly one which could easily play in a film today ethnic jokes are now totally verboten but fag jokes are still good clean family fun 
the two things are are good about this film are it s two unknown celebrities br br first daphne zuniga in her first appearance in a film young and supple with looks that still encompass her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects br br second the score by then known composer christopher young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star yeah i know one star more is not much but in this movie s case it is a lot br br the rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah blah we all know where this is going br br watch the first eighteen minutes with daphne zuniga then turn it off 
this movie was rented by a friend her choice is normally good i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie although it br br was a horror movie which i don t prefer but no horror came to mind while watching the movie it was a dull br br not very entertaining movie the appearance of denise richards br br was again a pleasure for the eye but that s it we br br we re a little bit disappointed but feel free to see this movie and br br judge it yourself 
i saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts i must admit i found it pretty decent until i started to think about what the characters were saying logical problems br br 1 her boyfriend who seems to be a pretty fit dude makes no sound while being killed don t you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer br br 2 when the remark is made that the gym teacher is soooo in love with lisa i almost screamed at the screen when your best friend s family has been killed by a teacher who was in love with her you don t make comments like that if you have half of a heart br br 3 as soon as nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead wouldn t the smart thing to do be to get donna boyfriend aunt and uncle into a car and drive far far away then bait the house with the hrt and police force so that the killer has no way to get out br br i could go on and on and on basically the plot was decent the characters weren t profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors br br however br br this movie might be good for teenagers or young couples just looking for a fun night out if you don t consider all the goofs it s a mediocre film 
a cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland the romance is very unrealistic fluttery lovey dovey perfect etc the cinderella plot till the very end and shahid kapoor is the only reason for my stars if you re looking for a dreamy romance with a twist this is definitely you re movie but for the rest of us real world people i d highly recommend saving your three hour watch time wake up people br br four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film we had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes maybe i m missing something i just can t believe a movie like this can beat a classic like hddcs 
this was an absolutely terrible movie don t be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history even their great acting could not redeem this movie s ridiculous storyline this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions maria conchita alonso appeared phony and her pseudo love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning i am disappointed that there are movies like this ruining actor s like christopher walken s good name i could barely sit through it 
after the superb aankhen which was a remake of a gujarati play he comes with waqt which too looks like a stage play br br in stage plays we have characters shouting overacting here too the same br br the first half shows amitabh almost kidding the 40 akshay kumar who acts too funny like a small nerd br br the film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way amitabh wants to make akki responsible is absolutely fake br br even his reason for hiding his sickness his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by akki is a put off br br some emotions do touch you but most are too over the top br br rajpal s comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half br br direction by vipul shah is too overdone though some scenes are good music is okay br br amongst actors amitabh overdoes it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes akshay kumar too does his part well but looks umcomfortable in some too weepy scenes his chemistry with bachchan is matchless rajpal is a highlight he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot boman is good in some comic parts but too loud at places priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do this is her last film with akki so far shefali is awesome though she looks too young for bachchan
i watched this movie for a project on love please tell nicolas cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character and then re read the lines he s saying my life cannot go on i accidentally cut off my own hand my brother was close by obviously his fault and since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of mom sad and alone no closure bad script and doesn t have enough extension of minor characters save yourself unless your up for a good laugh costumes were done appropriately and extras did a fabulous job i m sure it would have been a fun movie to make but keep it more genre specific i can t recommend this movie to anyone i know because it is not an intellectual movie it is not a chick flick it is not a strict romantic and i can t show kids because of the sex and questions to follow all in all just not a good flick 
i read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end however when i saw the movie i was very disappointed first of all no disrespect to deborah raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of 24 25 the late christopher reeve was also miscast same reason will according to the book was around 30 i would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life his friend red elly s trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters storyline development also miss beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a plus size lady i know the movie didn t have the budget of the bridges of madison county which i believe was released around the same time br br but to me this was a very poorly made low budget miscast movie as someone mentioned i wish that miss spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be she knows her characters better than anyone i hope that she would consider doing the casting too the movie let me down 
i can not believe such slanted jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material early on from such telling lines like we want to make sure they are playing for the right team and manipulative framing and lighting a love divided shows it s true face the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it s obvious intent so far from attempting art this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library 
i honestly believe that anyone considering film making be subjected to this mind boggling failure like the films of edward wood jr in the 60s and 70s this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts re editing their films and reworking their special effects until they finally look right this movie is also a decent argument for the studios pre screening process if mr hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience perhaps he would have cut 75 or the walking running strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes br br film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be every performance every line of dialog every digital effect every filter effect indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity a beginning filmmaker may find himself herself tempted from time to time to think at least i accomplished something or just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out br br critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment the worst movie ever made br br beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites also beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story writers and directors who watch bad made for cable movies of the week and think i can do better than that can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results br br i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers particularly those entering the craft in this current post lucas and post spielberg environment there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off some can t even come close to it 
they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent the bored young wives of wealthy older men ok there are lots of myths about ned kelly but there are also a lot of well documented facts still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation i mean this is not the robin hood story not the arthurian legends not beowulf not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99 guesswork it s only a couple of lifetimes ago my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was hanged br br so it s silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story having recently read peter carey s excellent novel the true history of the kelly gang i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein but no the fact is that mick jagger s much derided 1970 kelly was probably far closer to reality and a better movie overall which isn t saying a whole lot for it br br glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd i ll give it 3 10 and that s only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous 
this show is painful to watch  br br it is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show from the ever changing jobs boyfriends and cast it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something  but had no idea what and came up with this crappy show they cast her as a teen surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy soon they realize that she needs a clique and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers br br how this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me somehow abc has now decided that it is a family show and thrown it into it s afternoon lineup on abc family 
i m glad that i saw this film after mr sandler became famous br br it is bad bad bad bad there is no plot it s like watching a painfully dull home movie br br i really enjoy his other films but if you re a fan like me stay away from this one it may change your thoughts on adam you may never recover from the horror that is this film i ve had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home  
picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public in the street and ask him if he is black then walk away the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode more laughter now if you think the premise is funny and the show contains many such types of situation you will enjoy this show for the rest use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny another example of the humor in the show a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all 
although the director tried this attempt to transport the new testament in the screen failed the script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies while the duration is very long but the most tragic is the protagonist chris sarandon who doesn t seem to understand the demands of his role 
wow a movie about nyc politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in nyc you know there s a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour the characters are boring john cusack s accent is laughable and the plotline teeters between boring and laughable a horrible movie 
a disappointing film br br the story established our protagonist as chrissy a young rather sullen individual drifting not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn t surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives it s a pity though chrissy seem like interesting character br br story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated so the question now is when are we going to see the campions jacksons and the tamahori s breaking ground with compelling cinematically told stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the toll of two hours br br technically a disgusting shot film 
i went to see evening because of the cast i d gone to see norman s room for that reason that movie offering diane keaton leonardo de caprio and also meryl streep and had loved every minute of it same for the notebook even though it was chick flit lite and my feeling was anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave meryl streep patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good instead i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite simplistic and on one occasion truly offensive material br br now i had no problem with the way the film was structured i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse but while vanessa s character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt was a mistake was riveting at times the part actually showing what that past mistake was does nothing to clarify the matter in fact it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest girl meets boy girl gets boy girl loses boy fashion and in the most unbelievable clichéd wrong headed way possible br br and from here be spoilers so bear that in mind should you continue reading br br first of all claire danes was brutally miscast not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting don t get me wrong she can be good in the right role just not this one and patrick wilson was miscast though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off he d have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played the rich confused wasp and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all he s a bit too wasp y for that hugh dancy one note  i m a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why and the why was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died so ludicrous wrong headed and mishandled i nearly threw my candy at the screen br br as for the modern part between toni collette and her sister her fear of commitment her jealousy of her sister s perfect life her sister wondering if she s made the right choices her pregnancy and her too perfect boyfriend  anyway all this was hashed over in the 70 s and 80 s and in much greater depth do we really have to present it again and all as if it was fresh and momentous br br and to top it off meryl streep doesn t even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions she s still good but only because she s meryl and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup br br so to put it simply this movie has every cliché in the really meaningful message movie book and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out again at two hours long and laced with lifetime movie of the week music that is guaranteed to rub you raw it s a complete failure in both the meaningful and moviemaking aspects i give it 3 only because of meryl and vanessa br br now if all you require from your films is twadd le then please set my comments about evening aside and have the time of your life but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings rent norman s room and find out what truly great acting is 
i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted remembering rahs and raves for it but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary it backed off and went somewhere else the dripping water throughout the house the black rain the prophetic dreams taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream br br what a disappointment chamberlain s nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one s head the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods that the aboriginal peoples believe red haired white men were the first priests and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension br br in the final scene it wasn t clear to me what the director was trying to tell is there a big wave so what how big a tsunami yeah okay that s devastating but not apocalyptic is it the end of the world from a wave the last wave that d have to be a pretty darn big wave why was the world that bad a place it didn t seem so awful in this movie actually i didn t think the wave came off since the shadow left burton s face that had been cast by the wave was it only burton s apocalypse heck that happens every day to people who lose it it wasn t of any interest if it was only him br br the most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of weir s potential was in charlie s apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burton s wife charlie keeps asking him who are you and it becomes truly disturbing after a while unfortunately the movie never followed suit 
poor acting no script no plot no convincing killer no suspense no original setups it uses the same closet under the bed person behind you in the mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring and not in a foreshadowing way either and the fact that nobody ever really gets killed which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve more cheated for spending money on their admission ticket its a horror film w o any horror lmao the most you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet br br you have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this or you were high drunk at the time br br honestly i have a life and don t bother writing reviews that often unless i really really hated something or enjoyed it tremendously br br but this film is awful and i feel i have a duty of sorts to warn you not to give your money to hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again br br it is one thing to rent a bad movie at blockbuster from the weinsteins its another when you have to sit through it in a theater br br also in case you want some remake nostalgia forget it this is not a remake nor is it a re imagining it is not scary nor engaging nor is it satisfying enough to be funny like others on imdb have claimed it is just stale and booooring br br here is what you will take away from this film remembering the scar on brittany snow s head that stands out more than the plot the fact that jonathan schaech must be having some sexual affair with j s cardone of the forsaken to have gotten another role as a killer and that for some reason everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back what kind of person would not get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesn t show up this is my warning to you do not waste you re money like i did the original sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for jamie lee curtis fans though no way near as bad as this piece of crap 
a far as b movies go scarecrow is one of those that are so bad that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him apparently the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers this scarecrow aside from having a snappy one liner for each of his victims can also do matrix like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight also why did he always look like a rotted corpse just like the two needless sequels that followed this this isn t even worth a laugh 
this film is terrible you don t really need to read this review further if you are planning on watching it suffice to say don t br br the acting is horrendous serious amateur hour throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen only to find out that it is actually him a new low even for him br br the plot is terrible people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before even by the standard of hollywood action flicks this is a terrible movie br br don t watch it go for a jog instead at least you won t feel like killing yourself 
john carpenter s career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication his excuse is that he only produced it jon bon jovi looks like a girl in fact bon jovi and the two vampire girls natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes in short it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp model sort of way bon jovi has the most charisma at least he looks happy when he is smiling the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss but stop amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires at one point arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening as far as gore is concerned a few heads are ripped off and the blood spurts profusely these scenes have so little suspense or build up that when they happen it is almost funny and there is no horror pay off from the scene all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of wow that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls i wonder who has to clean it up throughout the movie these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover keep reaching out to her at one point bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow he says i am not trying to hurt you i just want to talk to you i want to get to know you huh of course the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device why can t we be friends the 1970s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie aside from all of the other silly moments there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion i guess blood type is not important anyhow all her vampire blood is removed bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also of course as the vampire blood is transfused into him none of his healthy blood is removed so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body and just like the first vampires this one also has the vampires bursting into flames special effect 
some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous not painful to watch with your significant other i was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie br br it was so slow and awfully strange br br both redgraves vanessa and natasha were unfit for this especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous brash american accent br br claire danes was the same wiggly lipped awkward girl that she was in my so called life she has yet to push herself in any way girl find a new way to pretend to cry br br meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie she was on screen for five minutes and i swear to god she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake br br oh and hugh dancy who gets better every time i see him br br glenn close and eileen atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes br br i mean this was a well shot movie it was very pretty the settings were interestingly dressed providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling br br i don t know it s just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of the greatest actresses of our time sucks so much it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors and the main character was a huge jerk i was glad she died but that s because i felt bad for lila ann s friend mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy br br ugh bad job evening the film you weren t entertaining and you weren t even thought provoking i sure hope the book was better so it didn t waste even more of people s time 3 10
sorry gave it a 1 which is the rating i give to movies on which i walk out or fall asleep in this case i fell asleep 10 minutes from the end really really bored and not caring at all about what happened next 
sexo cannibal or devil hunter as it s more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences starts with actress model laura crawford checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant jane after a long days work laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character s named chris thomas burst in kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous jane laura s agent gets on the blower to rent a hero peter weston who is informed of the situation the kidnappers have laura on an isolated island are demanding a 6 million ransom peter is told that he will be paid 200 000 to get her back safely a further 10 of the 6 million if he brings that back as well faster than a rat up a drain pipe peter his vietnam vet buddy helicopter pilot jack are on the island deciding on how to save laura so the kidnappers have laura peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe who worship some cannibal monster dude with bulging eyes as a god with human sacrifices this cannibal has a liking for young white female flesh intestines br br this spanish french german co production was co written directed by the prolific jesus franco who also gets the credit for the music as well sexo cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the uk as it was placed on the video nasties list in the early 80 s under it s alternate devil hunter title therefore officially classed as obscene banned having said that i have no idea why as it is one bad film even franco who isn t afraid to be associated with a turkey decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of clifford brown i d imagine even the most die hard franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing the script by franco erm sorry i mean clifford brown julian esteban as julius valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product wanted his named removed is awful it s as simple straight forward as that for a start the film is so boring it s untrue the kidnap plot is one of the dullest i ve ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved the horror side of things don t improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes as a horror film sexo cannibal fails as an action adventure it has no more success this is one to avoid br br director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try give the impression it s not attached to anything the cannibal scenes are poor the action is lame it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from a to b not really doing anything when they get there either it becomes incredibly dull tedious to watch after about 10 minutes don t forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it s uncut state i also must mention the hilarious scene when al cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff this is achieved by franco turning his camera on it s side having cliver crawl along the floor just look at the way his coat hangs the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along the gore isn t that great as far as euro cannibal films go this is very tame there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat a man is impaled on spikes there s some blood a handful of intestines there s a fair bit of nudity in sexo cannibal an unpleasant rape scene br br sexo cannibal must have had a low budget i mean low this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects rock bottom production values the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic the music sucks sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen the acting sucks the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act br br sexo cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give sexo cannibal as wide a berth as possible one to avoid 
the problems with this film are many but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones first of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and tv was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature the story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program but i believe the director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool 
you d better choose paul verhoeven s even if you have watched it 
no not the administration of gwb the decider strutter smirker but the mini series monarch cove lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time most of them broadcast between 11 p m friday nights and 1 a m saturday mornings as to why i watched the whole thing i can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism br br most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown the only two recognizable names are shirley jones and rachel ward who turn in the only decent performances ward by the way is aging quite well since her thorn birds days br br the one main thread to the plot who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of dad s murder but is freed after six years in the slammer is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you won t especially care who dun it there is a great deal of steamy sex several murders and all sorts of rude behavior virtually none of which is either interesting or credible most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented the writing and direction is on a par with the cast br br if you stick around to the end the post card is a hoot br br consider yourself warned 
i ll admit i ve only watched a handful of episodes but each one seemed completely different from the next it seems after the first season the producers decided to completely retool the show drop characters introduce new ones and rewrite the entire show dynamic br br as you have probably surmised already the show is about quirky unpredictable teenager holly who moves in with her high strung sister valerie in new york city decent enough premise odd couple fish out of water high jinx br br while i miss the sitcoms of yore this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly and it s sad because they have some decent talent br br on top of everything they insisted on changing the show when things change that drastically you get the feeling that even the show knows it s bad i mean completely new sets characters written off and new show regulars br br on a side note i know this is a television show and not real at all but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex with a terrace in manhattan are you serious 
i am currently sitting here forcing myself to finish this i figure i blew 6 bux on the vhs might as well suffer for it i remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for war of the worlds cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time and i missed the old tv series from the early 90 s the website make it out that this was a multi million dollar budget rendition of the classic book it was going to be a perfect translation perfect crap is more in tune with this film br br first off the video on this movie was glitched it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid 90 s pc or playstation cd rom video game sadly enough the color quality was similar the acting made shatners classic dramatic pause look damn near shakespearean in quality the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenes br br secondly it is slow and terribly drawn out i sat thru 45 minutes of the video before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien after that the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk attached to a mechanical arm the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental s the last thing on that for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900 s no one is concerned for their life it s like they have no concept even though media was slow word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known the illusion of day and night was shoddy at best simply changing the color around the people to purple blue or green does not signify night time perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the hero gallop around or walk down silly roads get on with the film i know how people get around you do not need to be so in depth br br now finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student the animations do not match up to the scenery at all br br in closing folks if you want the war of the worlds do one of four things 1 watch the 1953 original 2 watch the early 90 s tv series 3 wait for spielberg s rendition to be released shortly or 4 read the frikkin book avoid this movie it is a waste of your money 
1st watched 8 3 2003 2 out of 10 mindless 3 d movie about flesh eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d wow not that has been done time and time again in 2d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh eating that s what made the original zombie classics good the flesh eating was just thrown in as an extra we re actually bored throughout most of this 3 part chronicle because of the lame easily understood and slow pacingly revealed finale s the last story is actually the story the movie started with and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie s in that one as well well i think i ve said enough watch the classics not this 3d bore feast 
in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th valentine fails why did people like halloween because it was original new and went beyond anything that s ever been done why did they like scream because at least it made sense valentine is just a stupid slasher flick that has hardly any gore what so ever the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it s not funny and the moment the killer comes on screen you know who it is it s just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable the teen slasher genre is dead get over it br br 0 out of 10
when i first saw a glimpse of this movie i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball rachel york s portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous i cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy the producers decided to get rachel york she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent if you noticed york s portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin nothing is similar in any way her expression voice or movement br br to top it all off danny pino playing desi arnaz is horrible pino does not qualify to play as ricky he s small and skinny his accent is unreal and once again his acting is unbelievable although fred and ethel were not similar either they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and ricky br br overall extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball i suggest watching a e biography of lucy and desi read the book from lucille ball herself or pbs american masters finding lucy if you want to see a docudrama before the laughter would be a better choice the casting of lucille ball and desi arnaz in before the laughter is much better compared to this at least a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing 
the five or so really good westerns that mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in hollywood even john ford never made that many with so much quality the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are ford s my darling clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them or at least two br br the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase chase being responsible for the brilliant red river chase wrote far country bend of the river and probably some others but none of them are as finished as my darling clementine but then very few films western or otherwise are br br each of the five films of mann have huge gaps or is it six lets see bend far man of the west furies winchester 73 and yep six naked spur each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene with fairly glaring lapses yet so does red river which is still the single greatest western ever made so perfection isn t everything br br but the far country has huge huge holes it s mawkish and really comes alive only when stewart and mc entire are locking horns the rest is pretty pedestrian with the usual exception of mann s camera mann s camera is a one man course in cinematography it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film it is almost never in the wrong place never br br the far country has one amazing moment and as usual it comes from stewart nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man he is absolutely amazing look at him in bend far winchester and man from laramie in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau in far he is shot off a raft with such violence it looks so convincing that you wince and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man well you find yourself looking for the burn marks what an actor not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room also as well as anybody ever did it br br but that was mann s territory look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west as painful as any fight scene ever recorded cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight in short nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as mann br br what a great great director br br see every western he ever made they are his real monuments even if all are scetchy but so what when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody including ford and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone period br br thanks anthony 
this was the third remake of sleeping with the eniemy after yaarana and agnisakshi br br agnisakshi was the only one which worked and was a better film br br daraar is directed by abbas mustan who sadly failed in their attempt here br br the story was good but the handling wasn t that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointing br br direction is bad music is good br br rishi reprises his role of yaarana and looks too fat for the lead and is okay juhi is decent while arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible johny is too loud
the night of the prom the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives br br there really is no excuse for prom night there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of ghosts it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them br br the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage and the thing was it wasn t even a slightly exciting rampage maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn t really add to the effect either and to make matters worse the rest of the characters were equally one dimensional and oblivious the hotel staff didn t seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets nice one br br the worst thing was i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening shocking and the music don t even get me started it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral br br i really wish that prom night was a joke it was terrible and stupidly predictable no one in their right mind or otherwise has any reason to see this film mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film hear my plea don t do it there are better things to spend six pounds on like a sheet to play ghosts with 
this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression story writing is what movie making is about br br incredible visual effects very good acting especially from shue everything is perfect except the story is just poor and so everything fails br br picture this if you had the power to be invisible what would you do well our mad scientist here could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women this is all his supposedly genius mind could think of does he try to gain extra power no he doesn t even bother research a way to get back to being visible the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac br br add to that the lab atmosphere you have all these young guys throwing around jokes like they were in a bar if it wasn t for all the white coats and equipment you would think this is a bad imitation of cheers very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man s wolf br br even as a thriller the movie falls way short because most of the thrilling scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me br br if you read the actual book while the scientist goes after women there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character in the movie cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it just sad 
 br br first off this is a teen slasher flick the spam in a cabin genre as joe bob briggs piquantly put it if you re looking for roshambo this isn t it and wasn t going to be it i m desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography directing or acting performances br br secondly this wasn t zuniga s first horror flick it was her first screen appearance period cinema tv whatever for what it is worth neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburn br br thirdly you have to give even a lame slasher flick props sure it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof and the harvest time is now br br except this one gives the chop to the sweet virginal protagonist as well now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions interesting that this was said ingenue s only film role another one hit wonder except that term gives the lass too much credit br br br br granted i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with joanne br br 2 10 
i cannot believe that the indian film industry still puts out such third rate dross as waqt for starters the storyline is totally implausible spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self sufficiency so what does he do he promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges in the meantime his dad is dying of lung cancer but keeps it a secret from the son but he survives long enough to see his son become famous to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands br br the acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film as usual for indian films the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world br br to be honest the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film the actors such as amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar will still be revered as gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in bollywood 
my children watch the show everyday that its on its a great program for younger children however they need to stop showing re runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of rooney s and deedee s yellow teeth moe is the only doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don t ever brush their teeth does the show ever make its way to the united states and if so where can we find its schedule at and one other thing if we might be able to add moe you need to stop hiding so much sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope what does that signify other then getting wet all the time they need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole kids loose interest that way 
i just rented creep and was not at all impressed i didn t feel anything in this film i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking br br i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film haven t we seen this all before i didn t like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage i felt bad for him but then again i couldn t think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep so many questions need to be answered br br someone mentioned references to the ps2 game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely br br not a bad film not a good one judge for yourself 
so prom night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie i m a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning but upon seeing it it is neither horror or thriller br br i was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable you could predict what was going to happen next the young actors were alright at playing their characters but i d have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game acting wise br br yes i ll give props for the plot because it was good but it s not thrilling or scary there were almost zero jump in your seat scenes so don t waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres wait til it comes to dvd 
iberia is nice to see on tv but why see this in silver screen lot of dance and music if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie but otherwise one and half hour is just too long time if you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it s better to see bollywood movie they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie director carlos saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience and time to time it s look really good but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting there are many kind of art not everything is bigger then life and this film is not too big 
honestly i went to see the movie not because of the actors not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category believe me being a movie freak i have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture i have ever seen br br the plot is plain stupid the directing is awful acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so called horror soundtracks there isn t a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie and some of the scenes are really hard to stand i can t understand why the movie was rated 16 in germany where normally the criteria are real tough even a movie like state of grace is rated 18 no one can call this a horror movie because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public for me it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies in some scenes you see violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything the plot has holes and flaws the dialog is boring honestly i can t mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the british and scottish accent br br if i had something to say i would ban this movie from the theaters i fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap br br i m looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and i d be happy to discuss about one or the other topic br br livin the dream baby livin the dream david aames
i heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80 s movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see well i rented it and i have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as april fools day friday 13th and prom night this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story characters that i found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting instead the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste i was disappointed in his part in the end as far as the true identity of the killer goes when the identity was released as to who he was i just laughed but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed this movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don t spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory

a bdsm sub culture of los angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess plainly a vanity piece for its top billed player celia xavier who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters vanessa and celia a question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the county of los angeles while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon cd roms but when disaster befalls mistress vanessa virtuous celia determined to unearth her sister s vicious attacker begins a new job as a sex slave at the private castle club where the specialty of the house is a dungeon party two fbi field agents in addition to a los angeles police department homicide detective are assigned to investigate the crime while endeavouring to provide security for celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her flaws in logic and continuity abound such as a homicide being allocated to l a p d s operations south bureau a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post production editing and sound reproduction the mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie s end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario one solid acting turn appears among this slag stan abe as a zealous fbi agent

i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal in fact it probably is still brutal today but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly made for tv movie also women s rights were still budding in this nation during this time so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory and still show the realism of the era  would it make for good viewing honestly i don t know i have thought about this film for the past two days and i still can t seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasn t the greatest i have ever seen from several hodgepodge styles of acting to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland was it good was it bad that may be up for you to view and decide yourself but until then here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated br br this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes scenes where i wasn t sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting historical tale i do not know much about living in wyoming especially during the early 1900s so this film captured that image in my mind the thought of very cold winters no neighbors for miles upon miles and this polaroid esquire view untouched by corporate america it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience there were scenes that really stood out in my mind like the cattle branding scene the pig slaughtering scene and the saddening homesteader that didn t survive their journey that just brought a true sense of realism to this story director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers but i am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view br br while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrell s elinore randall the two as actors have no chemistry at all their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two veteran actors portrayed it the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done this is love was it supposed to be love i don t know i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond but with torn and ferrell it felt like two actors just playing their parts other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse knocks on the door for food or shelter the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinore s daughter the lack of true winter struggle and the entire land scene the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing why she was doing it and why clyde would build her a house if they were married it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore would have made for a stronger film br br overall i will go middle of the road with this feature there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation these panoramic scenes which in the span of 100 years have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers while there were some brilliant scenes of realism i just felt as if we needed more depth was a key element lacking in this film which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world but instead left open loopholes and clichéd western characters ferrell carried her own but torn was completely miscast decent for a viewing but will not be picked up again by me br br grade  out of 
admittedly i find al pacino to be a guilty pleasure he was a fine actor until scent of a woman where he apparently overdosed on himself irreparably i hoped this film of which i d heard almost nothing growing up would be a nice little gem an overlooked ahead of its time intelligent and engaging city political thriller it s not br br city hall is a movie that clouds its plot with so many characters names and realistic citywide issues that for a while you think its a plot in scope so broad and implicating that once you find out the truth it will blow your mind in truth however these subplots and digressions result ultimately in fairly tame and very familiar urban story trademarks such as corruption of power two faced politicians mafia with police ties etc and theoretically this setup allows for some thrilling tension the fear that none of the characters are safe and anything could happen but again it really doesn t br br unfortunately the only things that happen are quite predictable and we re left with several confession monologues that are meant as a whole to form modern a fable of sorts a lesson in the moral ambiguity of the real world of politics and society but after 110 minutes of names and missing reports and a spider web of lies and cover ups the audience is usually treated to a somewhat satisfying reveal i don t think we re left with that in city hall and while it s a very full film i don t find it altogether rich 
this is the worst documentary to come out of canada ever  i m glad to see the guys haven t made another movie all they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn t have to be the one they wrote they keep changing the script to suite the person they re pitching i could not get out of the theatre fast enough when i saw it at that year s toronto film festival please never see this film 
the acting is good the women are beautiful and the men are handsome so if you re looking for well acted soft porn this movie is for you otherwise you are wasting your time the motivation of the main characters in particular the eponymous lead is often a mystery she could have just told the truth the truth as presented in the film not necessarily the historical truth and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit was she protecting her father who went off half cocked as it were when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit was she protecting herself with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter during the trial this strong willed woman turns to mush before our eyes conversely her lover who starts off as a narcissistic jerk becomes a selfless hero during the trial at least his motivation is clearer he sacrifices himself for love naturally since no good deed must go unpunished we are told that she never sees him again 
john candy need we say more he is the main reason you should see this film most people don t realize how gifted he was as an actor witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk just a simple facial change and off we go there are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits the best moments for me are the kung fu u scenes as well as the great moment when john goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend i m sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude it is but it is also very funny mainly because it is john candy doing this bit the story in general is pretty lame and eugene levy and joe flaherty are not given enough to do in the film levy has his moments especially filming the wedding at the end and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid i give this one 4 out of 10 
not to be confused with the madonna film the next best thing the last big thing is a silly campy off the wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called the next big thing which reviews a variety of up and coming artists this low budget indie makes chuck and buck look like a masterpiece fraught with lousy acting poor sets and costuming etc  thing has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award pass on this one 
even if you re a huge sandler fan please don t bother with this extremely disappointing comedy i bought this movie for 7 99 assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked well there are quite a few scantily clad women but none get naked i m not sure what point this was in sandler s career but i m guessing it was even before his snl days i can be wrong this is like watching one of his home movies he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol times but we are left to dry this is hardly a movie sandler does a lot of talking to the camera and even admits at one point that this is no budget movie so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters there is no steady plot it s like an extended sketch comedy show but a crude and badly written one that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line take my wife please and the audience is on the floor i m not even going to try to make any logic here sure sandler s current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense but the comedy works this is a strictly amateurish work and even if you re curious about adam s early days in film you still won t be interested you re better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in mixed nuts of course the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance billy zane has a supporting role and the great burt young has a significant role br br this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99 cent rental section of your local video store and rightfully so br br my score 3 
well i can and will be very short this is a wrong balanced non convincing film that could have been a little bit better the script seems to not know which way to go  from funny to cliche wise serious it s a bit silly that plus too much sentences we have heard before the hacker is in florida or no he is in madrid no he is in  he is screwing the signal br br 4 out of 10
oh man is this movie bad it flows horribly the story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this doesn t love himself he tries getting out of the contract and horrible painfully unfunny gags ensue jim nabors seems as if he s sleepwalking not acting you ll miss such burt sidekicks as dom deluise and jerry reed while watching this stinker loni anderson s hair is downright scary proving that tons of hairspray didn t go out in the sixties or maybe that was a wig speaking of burt s wig wasn t bad in this film his worst wig day was in smokey and the bandit 2 anyhow this movie is the worst reynolds car movie ever ever right up there with cannonball run 2 the original smokey and cannonball are great funny films this one isn t even ned beatty who is a great actor stinks you ll long for a jackie gleason type villain who is fun to hate and mind you this isn t one of those fun movies to bag on it s lousy pure and simple even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring and worst of all unfunny and least i forget stroker ace was one of the first heavy nails to seal burt s coffin before his somewhat revival years later in boogie nights another film that like deliverance years earlier shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so 
i knew that evening was a girlie film so i was expecting to be bored a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a chick flick but that your companion would survive br br survive yes i am still here but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours it seemed a much longer evening than that i suppose that for yanks it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach well next to the beach in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film br br there s a monty python film about a knight who just won t die he ends up a wriggling torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis this film is also about a sort of living dead vanessa redgrave goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt she s not worried about having been a wide eyed breathless bimbo but imagines herself a murderess br br obviously being a girlie film there s a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy heathcliff character i m not a woofter so i can t claim to be a good judge of such things but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour he s a bloodless cypher br br as you might gather the main characters aren t much cop but the minor ones manage amazingly to be much worse there s a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers fair enough but it isn t the role of hamlet why ham it up so badly forgetting that it was a girlie film i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl friend would have told him that face fungus didn t flatter him but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a beard because he looked worse without it br br i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery if you re dragged along to it see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head just the sort of thing you d expect in a beach cottage br br apart from the obligatory wedding there is only one piece of action you d have thought that they d have got it right sadly though the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn t be there when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can t know is nearby if they don t have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him i suppose that the director s excuse is that it is supposed to be a half remembered dream sequence br br another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan i didn t think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties 
 oh wait i can this movie is not for the typical film snob unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions like continuity editing and geographic match i couldn t tell where i was in this movie one second they re in the present next minute their supposedly in the 70 s driving a modern suv and wearing what looked like to me as 80 s style clothing i think i couldn t pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible i think it only got attention because it has a 3d which i did not watch if you re a b movie buff and by b movie i mean bad movie then this film is for you it s home movie and all non sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake if your tastes are more for goddard and antonioni though just skip this one 
i wonder if there is any sense of sense in this movie its a big joke good its entertaining you get to see the most stupid plot played very seriously in the form of a film i wonder which audience group this movie is basically targeted to br br priety plays a surrogate mom for a happy couple salman rani who want a child but can t i wonder how it would be if this drama was a real life take off from a real couple s life br br rani appears happy with another pretty lady in her house who has been brought in to make a child for her salman she cares for priety and tries pushing her husband salman to preity so they may have some romance when will the audience get fed up of salman s nakhras br br though a good past time this movie is unbearable absurd 
it s impossible for me to objectively consider this movie not that i haven t tried mind you but i sit down and i pop in the aged vhs and i watch the opening and suddenly i m five years old again and clutching my very own care bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart br br i can see objectively that this movie is a bizarre combination of cuddly baby merchandising mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation but my inner five year old goes yay care bears every time i think about it so i d only recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it or those lovably cynical gen x y ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad strange to those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment you might want to keep looking 
this is an action western james steart leads an all star cast in the scenic northwest which is filmed in great splendor the scenery and costumes are great there is action and adventure stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old nothwest br br the main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that hollywood has always made into a hero even when this movie was made the cynic was the stereotypical hero and the one stewart portrays really has few saving graces he is kind to his two partners and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability br br however he is so piggish to everyone else it is hard to really care for him or to accept him he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters br br still the minor characters are quite enjoyable walter brennan royal dano harry morgan and others make this worth watching 
i had quite high hopes for this film even though it got a bad review in the paper i was extremely tolerant and sat through the entire film i felt quite sick by the end br br although i am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema i thouroughly enjoyed both woody allen s everything you ever wanted to know about sex and michael hanneke s funny games i found the directors obsession with this ten year old wanting to drink women s milk totally sickening and when the film climaxed in an orgy where the boy drinks both his mother s milk as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film i almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is br br don t get me wrong i enjoy the vast majority of european cinema as well as independently made films so this flick should have pleased me enormously avoid this film at all costs it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema 
definitely one of funny man eddie murphy s lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child three hundred year old dragons and a chosen one br br murphy is the chosen one in question and as the opening song suggests he is the best man in the world a finder of lost and missing children he is approached by a mysterious tibetan woman who tells him he is the chosen one and that it is his destiny to find and rescue the golden child for if the child were to die compassion would die with him as he is the bearer of compassion br br if all this hocus pocus rubbish hasn t ruined it for you now it surely will once the movie begins suffice to say the plot is abominable and destroys the whole film meant to be another vehicle for murphy s egotistical brand of humour the movie fails on many levels even charles dance as the evil sardo numspa can t do much for proceedings very silly and disappointing br br sunday december 12 1993 t v 
there are really two sections of this film firstly there s the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the the simpsons troy mcclure should be doing the narration br br then the rest of the film begins which while technically ok is killed by a vague inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters but characters that make no sense br br this is especially so with mickey rooney s spiventa who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the organisation the whole time yet what would have happened had hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out in that case he would ve been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character which in the end he still is br br the overall problem of the film is that it s totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy it s as if the filmmakers didn t have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions br br put simply the film fails on all levels 
if you look at corey large s information here on imdb apparently there s a movie called reload in production in which he s playing a character named sebastian cole br br first of all how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel  and second didn t sebastian get killed at the end of loaded br br i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia and so i was drifting in and out while it was on i m sure i missed some plot points but overall it seemed really weak large s performance was one of the stronger parts of the film i m also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty but not exceptional 
like so many media experiments this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary in the 5 years since it was released the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development and i found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason i imagine the director clearly is a fan of hitchcock and it s too bad that the film was not better executed but in fact it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention one can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page br br i have to admit i found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more sometimes the slick has less to offer us and i would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes oh yes and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot my heart rate went up and i was reluctant to get up and take a break 
i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college i ve tried to watch it three times the second two because friends wanted to see it sweet adam sandler i ve never heard of this movie but since he s so funny its gotta be funny wrong i can t make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing match insult war where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous but after watching this you ll know its true this movie isn t worth the price i paid for it i ve watched a ton of steven segal movies and i ve even watched crossroads twice but i still couldn t watch this 
all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente franka plays kate a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by someone or something with killer intentions br br plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy scary but plenty that are just plain dull br br all in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour br br the only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell who s done better than this that s even including erasmus microman 
i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel but when i saw that the book s author susan minot was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film i thought that evening would be a good adaptation br br if you enjoyed the book don t bother with this movie it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another br br here our characters are completely different the bride is in love with harris harris is the son of the housekeeper buddy is a drunk in love with ann and or harris i don t think a single character made it from the book to the screen oh it just gets worst with every passing moment br br and really didn t we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in to scenes of our heroes grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights simply does not work on film this film is a disaster skip it 
i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie i gotta come really hard on it talking about vivah this guy sooraj badjatya seems to have completely lost it after success of hum aapke hain kaun he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos vivah is so so cheesy that badjatyas have left johars and chopras behind br br there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say oh at least this thing is good aloknath does cliché in a role of girl s father shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets bad costumes hackneyed storyline monstrous stepmother trying hard to act actors cacophonous background music cheap soundtracks br br now the spoiler i m warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note 
who are these they the actors the filmmakers certainly couldn t be the audience this is among the most air puffed productions in existence it s the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot too much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie that s no fun to watch br br ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character s status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled bogdanovich the scenes with the breezy ms stratten are sweet but have an embarrassing look guys i m dating the prom queen feel to them ben gazzara sports his usual cat s got canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot which requires him to pursue audrey hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic in the meantime the budding couple s respective children spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on love while observing their parents everybody looks great but so what it s a movie and we can expect that much if that s what you re looking for you d be better off picking up a copy of vogue br br oh and it has to be mentioned that colleen camp thoroughly annoys even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack surely this is not what gershwin had in mind his stage musicals of the 20 s may have been slight but at least they were long on charm they all laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody least of all peter bogdanovich has the good sense to put on the brakes br br due in no small part to the tragic death of dorothy stratten this movie has a special place in the heart of mr bogdanovich he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn t prove popular his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood stories so there s no joy in criticizing the film there _ is _ real emotional investment in ms stratten s scenes but laughed is a faint echo of the last picture show paper moon or what s up doc following daisy miller and at long last love it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which p b has never emerged br br all in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental i want to watch people having a good time i ll go to the park on a sunny day for filmic expressions of joy and love i ll stick to ernest lubitsch and jaques demy 
i desperately want to give this movie a 10 i really do some movies especially horror movies are so budget that they are good a wise cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry definitely fits this budget to brilliance system the depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy ninja puberty stricken pre thirty year old student non cowboy drawing wise cracking son of a bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year all i can really say is can you dig it and recommend watching movies such as frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror br br what the hell were they smoking 
this movie never made it to theaters in our area so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it for once i should listened to the critics and passed on this one br br despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing i can see now why it went straight to video br br i had thought that with bloom ledger and rush it could have some value all have done wonderful work in the past br br the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast forward just to get to the end br br i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for eye candy purposes it won t satisfy even that 
 light spoiler alert the story sounds good and if you ve read the novel then you re probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships br br true enough the script tries to do that the director tries to do that but the main cast fails miserably maria s acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever her most intense moments seem almost comical sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend br br ioana seems even more tense than maria and even worse she doesn t seem natural at all maria had the attitude even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious but she had it and her character received some credibility and to make matters worse we don t have an insight on her where does she come from how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship how did the relationship evolve we only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to be there it has a content and and end but no beginning just like her partner maria she has only once scene that is truly touching the scene where she dumps maria s character kiki br br tudor is the only person in this movie who manages to prove some acting talent he has his character s attitude and it fits him only once or twice he seems to falter br br i love the story tudor chirila is ok there the landlady actually acts and puya delivers his couple of lines with style but this doesn t save the movie too bad the entire setting had huge potential and the romanian cinematography could ve used a movie on this theme br br oddly enough the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no background no feeling lesbian relationship of maria and ioana i m quite sorry for spending money on a ticket i d rather had watched it from the comfort of my room 
if you re after the real story of early baroque painter artemisia gentileschi you ll be disappointed however if you re after a reasonably crafted bodice ripper with an art theme you ve found you re movie br br this film is such a foundationally inaccurate depiction of artemisia gentileschi s life that it almost made me weep from a purely technical point of view though the film was alright the sets costumes and especially the chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive early 17th century experience although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a bit br br i wonder how the director co writer agnès merlet defended her film at the time perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim which would ve been unfortunate because lets face it she was 
en route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track a female reporter runs into a strange hitch hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination the strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area in the first story an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman s husband but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie and in the second story a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on br br the zombie chronicles is an attempt by writer garrett clancy and director brad sykes at making a zombie themed anthology a nice idea but with only two stories it falls woefully short and that s not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver the acting is lousy the locations are uninspired the script is dreary there s a sex scene with zero nudity and the ending  well that beggars belief br br to be fair some of sykes creative camera work is effective and joe castro s cheapo gore is enthusiastic an ear is bitten off eyeballs are plucked out a face is removed brains are squished and there is a messy decapitation these positives just about make the film bearable but be warned the zombie chronicles ain t a stroll in the park even for seasoned viewers of z grade trash br br i give the zombie chronicles 2 10 but generously raise my rating to 3 since i didn t get to view the film with the benefit of 3d 
i was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror the basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it wasn t able to excite really scare or shock me there was one part in the entire film that i thought was gruesome but even that didn t redeem it i did get to like the character of kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end the character played by jeremy sheffield was not actually needed for this film and i think the director writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on kate s part it may have worked jeremy s acting was wooden to say the least and i felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry or lack of it such a shame disappointing 
the tv guide calls this movie a mystery what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents this is bollywood at its best worst i honestly cannot tell the difference nauseatingly sweet kitschy clichés on every level story line situations dialog music and choreography to put it bluntly you must be a retard to enjoy it i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity but there were times when i had to walk away from it because i could not take it any more the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses br br 
this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre a masked killer stalks young pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways none of which are particularly inventive br br it s not scary it s not clever and it s not funny so what was the point of it 
i don t normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films i don t like but in a case like this one i just have to say something this movie is terrible illogical and stupid there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i don t even feel obliged to elaborate on because it s time for me to move on from this experience the most annoying point is however that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacon s character s madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition br br granted the special effects are impressive and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff however this movie is stupid and generally doesn t come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment br br in short as many other reviews here say stay away from this film 
outlandish premise that rates low on plausibility and unfortunately also struggles feebly to raise laughs or interest only hawn s well known charm allows it to skate by on very thin ice goldie s gotta be a contender for an actress who s done so much in her career with very little quality material at her disposal br br 
the only thing i remember about this movie are two things first as a twelve year old even i thought it stunk second it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it br br if you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try animal house it s so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art another good selection would be caddyshack the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper carl spackler s correct me if i m wrong sandy but if i kill all the golfers they ll lock me up and throw away the key 
i hate this movie it was nothing like the book and just thinking about it makes me mad if you watch the movie before reading the book then yeah it s a good movie but king s book was amazing and this movie was nothing like it i mean the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different the ending for example so in the book it is extremely intense and danny and wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze yeah there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it another part that made me angry was that jack just kills mr halloran what the heck he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn t important overall it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off 
this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but it s surely a damn bad movie br br the holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it s poor production values and stupid plot i mean the sub genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add br br the clichès are more than boring the gore is minimal and so does the mystery br br this is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn t be hyped even if it has a video nastie label br br i am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash 
the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed ooooof her loins rival those of nina hartley this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me i d forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene good grief reminding me what a smokin hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the 80s kurt russell must have had a fun life 
i used to love this movie as a kid but seeing it again 20 years later it actually sucks up the academy might have been ahead of it s time back in 1980 but it has almost nothing to offer today movies like caddyshack and stripes hold up much better today than this steaming dogpile no t a no great jokes except for the one liners we ve all heard a million times by now br br i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being well i was way off the soundtrack had only 2 3 widely recognizable hits and the frequent voice overs were terrible the only thing that was interesting to me was predicting what the character s lines were before they said them yep i watched this movie that much back then br br the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten sorry to say 
 that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful oscar winning performance one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxx s performance in ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like bait and booty call i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar i would laugh right in their faces who knows maybe he s better off sticking to drama because if you watch bait it s clearly evident that comedy is not his forte i swear jamie mugs so much in this movie that i m surprised his face didn t fall off and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesn t require being loud and obnoxious if a joke is funny it s funny if it s not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character in real life normal people don t always have witty comebacks and quips like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in taxi driver it s important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model if a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken and wouldn t the police try to scold him if he was there are many scenes like that throughout the film another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent not funny not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether it s the right time for it or not i m not even a big mike epps fan but even his performance is good in comparison to jamie s as a matter of fact this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more low key approach one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality however fellow green mile star doug hutchison is disgustingly over the top as the villain a big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in the green mile also playing a heavy antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like the replacement killers and training day even in bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another unless you re a die hard fan of foxx please don t take the bait 
from a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer bad acting finding john christmas is better left lost ms bertinelli s performance is without depth or emotion as are her co stars william russ as brother hank and david cubitt as love interest noah jennifer pisana as soccoro the daughter of single dad noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing but who can blame them with material like this michael j murray s script is juvenile at best br br each year at this time i search the tv guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen films like miracle on 34th street ernst lubitsch s delightful the shop around the corner and of course the 1951 version of scrooge there s frank capra s classics it s a wonderful life and meet john doe hey forget the classics what about home alone or home for the holidays with holly hunter and a great performance by robert downey jr br br my present to you is by way of advice your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding finding john christmas merry christmas 
this movie is a 90 minute ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom what kind of high school is this anyway br br unless you are a major ramones fan do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish this movie should be called ramone fever everyone appears to like them in this movie there is not a plot to be found in this flick as far as teen comedies go you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one 
a couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in china wang lung buys o lan his future wife who becomes his slave american stars appear in the leading roles talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology a good wife many children and land are the best things for men to have they are seen as property and investment because it is a big budget movie in which many extras cooperate big sets are built and special effects take place the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors luise rainer won an academy award for this performance which is definitely the worst in the movie her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience o lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with on the other hand paul muni gives a better performance showing his talent ones again another problem with the movie is the ending it seems like franklin did not know when to end the picture this film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of chinese culture and traditions 
a very cheesy and dull road movie with the intention to be hip and modern shown in the editing style and some weird camera angles resulting only in sleepiness br br the cast is wasted the writing is stupid and pretentious the only thing worthwhile is the top notch lalo schifrin s soundtrack really cool and also the opening sequence very original and interesting br br run if you can the bad opinions and comments about this flick are totally deserved it is really pure garbage of course that this has its charm of watching a movie which everybody would not drop the beer glass on if it were on fire but save it for a stormy day where you have absolutely nothing else to do 
burt kennedy used to be a very good director but you d never know it by this lumbering mess not only does this film look cheap it is cheap most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior the last command from 1955 and that footage shot 32 years previously looks more contemporary than anything in this picture the few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized confused and incompetent looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture this has the look and feel of a bad student film it moves like molasses the acting for the most part is either over the top ham or under the top comatose although raul julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast and it s chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies on top of that it s way too long if you re going to make a boring film do it in an hour or so and get it over with don t stretch it out over three hours like this one does if you want to see a good movie about the alamo check out john wayne s 1960 version or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy skip it 
the zombie chronicles br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format mono br br whilst searching for a ghost town in the middle of nowhere a young reporter picks up a grizzled hitchhiker who tells her two stories involving flesh eating zombies reputed to haunt the area br br an absolute waste of time hobbled from the outset by haggerty s painfully amateurish performance in a key role worse still the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by brad sykes previously responsible for the likes of camp blood this isn t a fun movie in the sense that ed wood s movies are fun sykes home made movies are in fact aggravating boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative badly conceived junk the 3 d format is utterly wasted here 
the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite although turturro is an actor i generally like his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi autistic man was annoying overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances 
i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn t take anymore it felt as though i d watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit me  there s nothing new here i ve heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ect none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker 
with a cast list like this one i expected far better venessa redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed the best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie the plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death the thing is she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy all the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped i also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary it seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the da vinci code in which the device was used to increase suspense or from the notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story s main characters either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it didn t work to create anything it was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none i left wondering why good movies can t be written for women it really was a disappointment 
jamie foxx is my favorite comedian however i feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of chris tucker martin lawrence and dave chapple who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept br br okay i laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles but i would love to see these guys branch out ala marlon wayans portrayal in requiem to a dream or in living color s tommy davidson and damon wayans moving performances in spike lee s satire bamboozled 
if i could give this film a real rating it would likely be in the minus numbers while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible horror films seriously people buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time br br despite it being a horror film there is nothing scary about it unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché s you can fit in one movie scares you if the rating had been higher it probably would have made for a better film in the long run br br whoever made this version of prom night you screwed up the actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren t for the questionable scripting this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip i d sooner go and see one missed call again at least that had some plot 
what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica alba br br unfortunately the powers that be over at fox decided that they needed to fine tune the plotline within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldn t sleep br br the moral of the story if it works don t screw with it br br azjazz
let s face it some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow das no gonna happen neva omfg this stupid loser kid who can t stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom right as he dies he looks up at the scarecrow and he let s his spirit go into the scarecrow the drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it we later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow they had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with takes one to know one loser the scarecrow flips off the building calls him daddy o and then beheads the poor man we can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that he goes on to kill many people afterward he mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people just for some laughs no laughing here he adds a punchline to every kill too every time he killed someone he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines in the case of someone who was hard of hearing he would say here have an ear of corn then shove it up their ass or we can actually take an example from the movie he just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him her father the sheriff yelled to the madman to stop and he said hey stay awhile and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree in the end of the movie he killed two guys and threw in the punchline gotta split and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads wowzors this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad maybe next time this guy makes a movie it won t be gay 
this movie could be used in film classes in a how not to script a b movie course there are inherent constrictions in a b movie budgets are tight time is precious and the actors are often green and inexperienced the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you scarecrow s script seems to have been written in a drunken haze i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie but i ll just mention one the gravedigger the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie he is shown with his daughter who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count why give the gravedigger a daughter why give the daughter a boyfriend why introduce them so late in the movie why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline scarecrow doesn t seem to care br br the story of scarecrow goes something like this lester is a high school kid who is picked on by the other kids he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy his mom is a lush and the town whore one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings and later kills lester in a cornfield under the titular scarecrow magically lester s soul goes into the scarecrow somehow this transference changes lester s soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him those who smoke pot in the corn field those who dig graves boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set br br the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned the director does an impromptu version of rap music admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by life ez a bitch but et has a great ass br br number of beers i drank while watching this movie 5 did it help no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level 
i had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what in my opinion is this shockingly bad film it fails on pretty much all levels the cast is awful the acting ham at best and the plot lacks any depth leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines br br plan b has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and i found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy br br a bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie 
what did producer director stanley kramer see in adam kennedy s novel and kennedy s very puzzling screenplay were there a few pieces left out on purpose and what about gene hackman richard widmark edward albert eli wallach and mickey rooney what did they see in this very muddled story br br and why did candice bergen who gave a horrible performance accept such a thankless role br br the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin a major misfire by stanley kramer 
let me be really clear about this movie i didn t watch this movie because of the plot i watch it for the saucy sex scenes that being said this movie is so god damn awful i flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of traci and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot br br spoiler alert the first scene of the movie already had me cringing you see a woman painting something by the lakeside in pure bliss and serene then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her when they both finished they show each other what they had done and the woman painted a vineyard when she is facing infront of the lake what kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake and in another scene traci gets to kill her teacher s lover by smash him with the sail pole and then she swims away and none of the town s police suspected her once i mean hellooooo mandy did not wear a glove did she her finger prints are all over the god damn boat after that it gets worst whenever mandy is around there is the chilling sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit it s also a real pity rosanna arquette s is in this movie i feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft porn no brainer same goes for jürgen prochnow who also has the misfortune to star in this movie all in all 2 10 
mad magazine may have a lot of crazy people working for it but obviously someone there had some common sense when the powers that be disowned this waste of celluloid the editing is el crapo the plot is incredibly thin and stupid and the only reason it gets a two out of ten is that stacy nelkin takes off some of her clothes and we get a nice chest shot i never thought i would feel sorry for ralph macchio making the decision to be in this thing but i do and i really feel bad for ron leibman and tom poston gifted actors who never should have shown up in this piece of film at least mr leibman had the cajones to refuse to have his name put anywhere on the movie and he comes out ahead there are actually copies of this thing with mad s beginning sequence still on it if you can locate one grab it cuz it is probably worth something it s the only thing about this movie that s worth anything and a note to the folks at imdb com there is no way to spoil this movie for anyone the makers spoiled it by themselves 
eddie murphy s delirious is completely and totally rude crude crass and lude this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling trashy piece of stand up eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over he does manage to be funny occasionally but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes br br forget it unless you happen to enjoy eddie s foul style i don t think i will bother with eddie murphy raw i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie script br br saturday january 17 1998 video
i shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing preachy cinematic trash larded with enough indian wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new age shop starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather wearing crystal fondling idiot br br the plot alien rae dawn chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert earth s impending environmental collapse but first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a castro street bar fortunately they ve got mystical grandpa willie nelson along to help along with buckets of cheap f x and reams of pointlessly swelling music br br sure the clunky script helps to obscure the film s trite plot and staggering pace but that s just the tip of this melting movie iceberg everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science 
well what was fun except for the fun part br br it s my second least favorite so far i even thought it was worse than lazarus and ghost in the machine br br let s start with the good the teaser it was incredibly well done and also emotional being the great animal lover that i am it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode br br but then there s all the bad and believe me there is a lot of it little made sense so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated whaaa the dialog was also pretty awful there were about one or two quotable lines br br and worst of all having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me in the end what s the point they all pretty much died we didn t learn anything we weren t entertained and i couldn t even find sophia s death sad just very frustrating br br  star shame because season 2 was doing so well 
i m watching this on the sci fi channel right now it s so horrible i can t stop watching it i m a videographer and this movie makes me sad i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie some of the camera work is good most is very questionable there are a few decent actors in the flick too bad they re surrounded by what must have been the director s relatives that s the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie music was a little better than the acting if you get around to watching this i hope it s because there was absolutely no other option the sequel is coming on now i think i ll skip it jason
god i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot i had been expecting a lot from it as i m a huge fan of james cameron and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration in all that time it barely went beyond its two line synopsis and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere on top of that i don t think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular a team episode as for alba yes she is gorgeous of course but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie makes me also get bored of her gal wit an attitude schtick pretty soon you can count me out of this one mr cameron 
three part horror film with some guy in a boarded up house imploring the viewer not to go out there and gives us three tales to prove why br br the first story involves a young couple in a car accident who meet up with two psychos it leads up to two totally predictable twists still it s quick violent well acted and well done predictable but enjoyable br br the second involves a man on the run after stealing a large amount of money his car breaks down he s attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic very obvious badly done and extremely slow even at 30 minutes this is too long good acting though br br the third is just barely a horror story it involves a beautiful lonely woman looking for mr right it has beautiful set designs a nice erotic feel and a nice sex scene but predictable and not even remotely scary br br it ends very stupidly br br all in all the first one is worth watching but that s it tune in for that one then turn it off 
ah channel 5 of local mexican t v everyday at 2 00 a m they air horror movies from the 70 s to early 2000 s it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching it br br the original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word br br the movie at some points looks like a soap opera because of it s absurd dialogs cinematography and direction br br my advice is avoid this one at all costs it s a movie that it shouldn t be watched by anyone not even for lovers of mediocre film making br br you have been warned 
sloppily directed witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the classic 50s alien invasion films but really is no better than them except of course in the purely technical department and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens you ll be begging for some peace and quiet 
 valentine is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list it certainly isn t as good as those movies that i have listed about but it s better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first friday the 13th film one of those films was the 1981 canadian made my bloody valentine which i hated alot valentine is a better film than that one but it s not saying much the plot a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up then they re picked off one by one the killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge but is it him or could it be somebody else valentine has an attractive cast which includes denise richards david boreanaz marley shelton jessica capshaw and katherine heigl they do what they can with the material they ve got but a lackluster script doesn t really do them any justice there are some scary moments throughout however br br 
basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970 s classic kitsch horror death line which ironically was like this cobblers also partly filmed at the disused aldwych underground station br br making good use of the now disused jubilee line platforms at charing cross as well as the aforementioned aldwych this film contains basically the same plot dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train originality is not this film s strong point br br indeed strong points are sadly lacking the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device br br franke polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film out acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats br br if creepy films set on the london underground are your bag or you just want to play spot the tube location them pick this up on dvd when it hits a bargain bin if you are looking for classic horror go and dig up a copy of death line br br if you are looking for a quality well written and acted film you will need to change trains  
other than some neat special effects this movie has nothing to offer they threw in some gore and some nudity to try and make it interesting but with no success kevin bacon s acting was pretty good but he couldn t salvage the movies lack of plot 
city girl meg tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and understandably shaken returns home to her family s rural digs only to be faced with a mystery why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways radiation thriller with barely a nod to ecology has small town residents going berserk which includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and tim matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench the picture is too silly for words wasting tilly s wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it can t possibly hope to get out of some of the cinematography by thomas del ruth is good though he is let down by the scrappy editing and a fairly bathetic finale simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve 1 2 from  
i ve just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot i could make a better movie with my cellphone camera how do they manage to get actors to play in those movies porn movies have better scenarios and effects i wish i had those 2 hours back br br the only good thing about this movie is the cast even though their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable the rest was just way too bad br br it s the type of movie that i d recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight br br even worse i saw a translated version of this flick imagine a bad movie with an even worst translation yikes 
because it is that s why this is the same jealous daughter kills people flick we ve seen a billion times rosanna arquette makes anything worth watching and mandy schaffer s brief nude scene at the end almost make this trite blarney worthwhile but not quite br br  out of  
warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place other than that libelous scandalous filmed in canada presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary kenn borek air 
having decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there what i didn t realise however was that there could be one this bad i ll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is the funniest dialogue in it goes like this knock knock who s there  the big stinking man the big stinking man who  the big stinking man is you yes folks it really is that bad billy bob is only in it for about two minutes and the rest of the movie is painful for some reason though although it s undeniably awful i don t hate it that s probably because i save my ire for any high budget special effects laden junk like the fast and the furious and not a no budget flick like this one 2 10 at a push 
this movie was so badly written directed and acted that it beggars belief it should be remade with a better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand ri chard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning couple although both normally do fine work the actors should not have attempted to do accents at all they are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african merchant been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable marcel has pronounced african features including an obviously dyed blond fro it s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color it s just so weird this could be a great movie and should be re made but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction 
this film is predictable it is more predictable then a vinnie testaverdi pass when he huts the ball for the jets one saw the ending coming up halfway through the film the politics reminds me when i was back east many people know when the fix is in i gave this four because of the acting but the story is lame 
i just watched this film 15 minutes ago and i still have no idea what i just watched mainly i think it s a film about an internet s m star of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online she s murdered by someone which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic as the real thing i know wow br br michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him he s in the film for about 15 minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason i won t even explain the ending because quite frankly i can t make it out myself but before the final scene we re treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all br br all in all stay away from this film i got it because i love bad movies and i love michael madsen i really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining 
imagine you re a high school boy in the back of a dark uncrowded theater with your girlfriend how bad would a movie have to be in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended this movie is that bad really movies often become so bad that they re good this movie is beyond that stage of bad ness it is painfully bad horribly terribly crime against humanity bad 
photography was too jumpy to follow dark scenes hard to see br br had good story line too bad it got lost somewhere too noisy for what was really happening bottom line is it s a baddddd movie
this movie was crap with a capital c the opening scene showed promise but that promise was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going br br and the wooden statue morty who was rather creepy in the original film looks plain goofy in this one it was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume br br and then there s a scene where the hero hits his father s tombstone with a sledgehammer you might guess a two by four someone might venture no he angrily beats his father s tombstone with a twig a freakin twig but worse than that once the characters walk away the tombstone actually and inexplicably bleeds oh brother br br there s also a native american guy who lives with the main character s grandparents but apparently does nothing except morty maintenance he perpetuates creepy morty legends warns those who scoff and even fixes morty s arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank but for all his respect for and tenderness toward morty does morty give a rat s hairy behind no br br the movie drags on and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears this film is a real yawner don t rent it 
when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy xander and figured ah how nice that he s still making a living acting in movies now a weird movie i can stand given that it s a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies twin peaks lost highway etc and you sort of have to be in the mood for one this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory s that make absolutely no sense i mean come on people nazi s who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers i was surprised they didn t mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense but seriously i don t condone drugs like i don t condone this movie it should be burned shredded and forgotten just so good ol xander might get another acting job it wasn t his acting though that was alright but the script just didn t make any sense sorry 
the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid at least all i lost was 3 00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location mr fbi handed the female a revolver when the alleged killer came out the door the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian i think not ms xavier appears to be a very attractive female it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out 
devil hunter gained notoriety for the fact that it s on the dpp video nasty list but it really needn t have been many films on the list where there for god only known reasons and while this isn t the tamest of the bunch there isn t a lot here that warrants banning which is a shame because i never would have sat through it where it not for the fact that it s on the shopping list the plot actually gives the film a decent base or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal films and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged off into the amazon jungle a hunter is then hired to find her but along the way he has to brave the natives lead by a man who calls himself the devil the film basically just plods along for eighty five minutes and there really aren t many scenes of interest it s a real shame that jess franco ended up making films like this because the man clearly has talent as seen by films such as the diabolical dr z venus in furs faceless and she kills in ecstasy but unfortunately his good films are just gems amongst heaps of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap i saw this film purely because i want to be able to say i ve seen everything on the dpp s list and i m guessing that s why most other people who have seen it saw it but if you re not on the lookout for nasties there really is no reason to bother with this one 
an old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies you get your hitchcock your chaplin your bergman and some other stuff prior to the 80ies to disguise that he has no clue what is going on in cinemas these days he throws in the matrix br br but it s not only the same lame film as art speech all over again this speech is reduced to outdated psychological platitudes it ego super ego anal phase sexual insufficiency br br it is garnished with the cheesy effect of having zizte edited into the movies he is taking about for someone who is supposed to know much about movies his own is cinematographicly speaking yeiks br br to put it in zizek s own words i saw 5 7 on the screen last night or in the words of a great movie maker br br mr what you ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you points and may god have mercy on your soul 
thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called german independent series four for venice is not only awful but really awful so awful that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash br br nick and charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession eva and luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth where eva works as a waitress and luis an artist nick indirectly causes eva to lose her job as an waitress luis and charlotte had an affair at the back of eva and nick luis cheated on eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to london to do something related to his artwork but the fact is he is flying off to venice with charlotte for an adultery holiday eva kidnapped nick and dragged her 2 kids along to venice for confrontation the trip to venice ends up both nick and eva falling for one another br br the presentation of the journey from germany to venice between nick and eva marks the failure of the comedy it not only look senseless but also draggy in the film nick try to seek help for several ways but it ends to no avail it is either the strangers around him who acts like morons or they are just simply dumb br br the comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story while some of the problems that can be solved with common sense no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem they prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem br br it fails so bad that even the beautiful sceneries in venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film 
add to the list of caricatures a southern preacher and congregation a torch singer a dancing chorus and the mills brothers it only makes it worse br br contemptible burlesques of negro performers who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race though the negro comedy may have been accepted in its day it s extremely offensive today and i doubt that it was ever funny though i wouldn t have been offended i don t think that i d have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor as an 11 year old white boy however i might not have understood some of it 
not a woman film but film for the gang one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman director andy mckay simply doesn t know woman peaks of bad taste american pie s humor style crude story no sense groundless story refuted characters vulgar fantasies came to life on screen insulting and definitely not funny i wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it 
weak plot predictable violence only semi interesting characters like the writer was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it hot from the predictable rap and house soundtrack to the family conflicts it s poorly acted stereotypical and ultimately terribly boring even the title has been done before imdb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007 2008 br br note saw it on showtime which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop even tho another stereotype would have made it interesting if it happened 
anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series the borg does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the gamma sector the klingons are never seen until kirk encounters them the ncc 1701 was the first ship to carry the enterprise name need i go on berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberry s creation after he died they only saw and just went their own way no wonder majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series i don t blame her for not being involved with this mess poor bakula he s a great actor as are the entire cast i like them all but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series just check the ratings i think more people watched deep space 9 
i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash there are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you the sex sequences so shocking in its day couldn t even arouse a rabbit the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism the film is self consciously arty in the worst sense of the term the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle even the sound is bad and some people call this art br br 
 spoilers br br i was very disappointed in love s abiding joy i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re aired thursday night on hallmark i love the first three love movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be the whole movie was sad and depressing there were way to many goofs and the editing was very poor to many scenes out of context i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and clarks appearance in the movie just didn t seem to fit it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there they were all lacking emotion there seemed to be no interaction between missie and willie at all br br i think the script writers should have went more by the book it seems like every movie that s been made so far just slips further and further away from janette oke s writings i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it and i think missie and willies reactions to kathy s death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard br br out of the four movies that have been made so far i d have to say that love s abiding joy is my least favorite i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if clarks character is in them i hope he s got a bigger part and i hope his part isn t so bland i also hope there is more of scottie and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next 
one of the most disgusting films i have ever seen i wanted to vomit after watching it i saw this movie in my american history class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the west during the late 1800 s what we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered human birth branding oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn t too bad but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom the story itself was ok the premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy they live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the west during the late 1800 s but if you have a choice do not see this movie 
wow this is really not that good br br i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good it is but it is nothing special br br the movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies br br  
this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized there are two routes to take in horror films either you don t really explain what s going on or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained br br unfortunately creep fails in this area i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation no character is fully realized although the circular nature of kate s character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story br br in the end this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film making that drag down the film br br this film will go down as another example of a film that could be so much better even though it would never be great the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting the characters story direction and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift br br creep does serve a purpose as a mindless silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment but sadly that s about it 
before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to rewatch something i first saw on the tv ads in 1980 barbara bach s cleavage and since the movie received an r rating i expected to see her nude alas no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here stacey nelkin who s supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as ms bach they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides in fact i don t blame ron leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tight fisted liceman is pretty embarrassing though i did like the seduction scene he did with ms nelkin this also happens to be the debut of ralph macchio who s the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms bach an arab who worships motor oil and a politician s son who loves his girlfriend candy so much he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy among the supporting cast tom poston plays a swishy character named sisson who i found partly amusing with a screenplay by tom patchett and jay tarses and direction by robert downey sr up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you re really offended at the scatological and sexual content this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boy alfred e newman shouldn t be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture p s another one of the misfits was harry teinowitz who was born in my birth town of chicago ill he played rodney ververgaert he also says one of my favorite lines i m trying to come 
robert taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western it was one of the few times that taylor would play a heavy in a film nonetheless this picture was far from great as shortly after this taylor fled to television with the successful series the detectives br br stuart granger hid his british accent and turned in a formidable performance as taylor s partner br br taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the indians really shows br br another very good performance here was by veteran actor lloyd nolan as an aged drinking old timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well in his early scenes nolan was really doing an excellent take off of walter huston in his oscar winning role in the treasure of the sierre madre in 1948 note the appearance of russ tamblyn in the film the following year tamblyn and nolan would join in the phenomenal peyton place br br the writing in the film is stiff at best by the film s end it s the elements of nature that did taylor in how about the elements of the writing here 
this can t be mandy schaffer s last film somebody do something first the way traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment in order to see whatever she was supposed to see and never got seen in return was very annoying hollywood please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives it s dumb write better scripts so you won t have to use that lame plot device any more if your script isn t good enough to stand up without that then don t produce it br br second carmen wouldn t have fallen for that fake injury trick that traci pulled she already had traci fingered more bad writing directing there br br i could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it actually i didn t hate it as much as the others seem to have it just didn t have much of a reason for being made unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely mandy oh and to whoever didn t think she was sexy the character wasn t very well written but how can you say she wasn t sexy one or the other of us needs glasses and i don t think it s me br br more mandy br br p s did i mention i hope mandy makes me more movies  d
it was 9 30 pm last night at my friend s camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park the thing is in my country south park airs at 10 30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing father of the pride i ll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes the first time i watched it i found it unfunny and crude for nothing so i thought holy sh t i have a football game early tomorrow so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons but yesterday i tried to give father of the pride a second chance i find that it s a complete rip off of the simpsons only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead br br the second thing is i wonder why it got it s tv 14 rating i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual jokes the simpsons is also a lot more violent and crude i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2 well i ve got news for him shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile three or four times br br all in all i don t mind father of the pride i don t hate it but i don t like either i ve seen way better from the simpsons br br 3 5 10
casting bone to pick david jannsen was 38 playing the father of robert drivas who was then 31 i assume the ama wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 year in medicine this movie hasn t aged very well at all and now it s main appeal is just to see a snap shot of sin city circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking the weird hair and trendy fashions that went along with it if anyone remembers lv wasn t exactly london the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous his dad thinks he might be gay and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino and plies him with girls interestingly enough the son doesn t seem to mind being thought of as gay unusual for the time and a cute brenda vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him what nudity there is is awfully lame just what was needed to pull the audience in for an r rating in the early days of the mpaa rating system and x the editing is horrible and there s stupid silly overdubs by the committee don rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better casino two decades later not to give anything away but they would ve dealt with mr rickles character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then a curiosity at best far from joshua logan s usual caliber of work dos dias now go watch casino again 
amateur no budget films can be surprisingly good  this however is not one of them br br ah another brad sykes atrocity the acting is hideous except for emmy smith who shows some promise the camera direction needs serious reworking and no more hold the camera and run gimmicks either it just doesn t work the special effects are unimaginative there s a problem when the effect can be identified in real time if you re going to rip off an ear please don t let us see the actor s real ear beneath the blood the scenery is bland and boring and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar driven metal br br did i mention the lack of any real plot or character development apparently the scriptwriter didn t br br whoever is funding this guy  please stop i ve seen some of his other home movies and they are just as bad normally a director will grow and learn from his previous efforts  not this guy it s one thing to be an amateur filmmaker but anyone can be a hack br br definitely not even a popcorn film  of course chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort br br award the worst ever military push ups in a film 
this is the first time i ever saw a movie with jamie foxx and i bet it will be my last i failed to see why he was funny although people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera or for saying i am going to take a shower br br the plot is completely predictable the bad guy comes after the good guy the good guy has a woman so the bad guy uses her in between the officials screwing up the final scenes are utterly unbelievable you spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy but you don t do your home work to solve a trivial riddle br br there s no great acting there isn t much of a plot or storyline and the shooting is done mtv style don t waste your money on this one br br 
this debuted today on the scifi channel and all i can say is i am speechless i taped it today so i could watch it tonight after work i had high hopes now i am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so i can hang myself possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i wish i could say something nice like it was fun to make fun of this movie but this movie is giving me nothing to work with i know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but i am going to anyway this movie sucks there i said it they should show this flick to film students to show them what not to do my nine year old niece could make a better film the only decent thing about this film is the sound and or sound track oh i just found a rusty c clamp in my old tool box i am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen i could just tape over this vhs but i think i will burn it in the fire pit instead i could wash with soap but i fear i will never be clean again christmas is coming buy this movie and give it to people you hate mike
i very much looked forward to this movie its a good family movie however if michael landon jr s editing team did a better job of editing the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context i do hope there is another movie from the series they re all very good but if another one is made i beg them to take better care at editing this story was all over the place and didn t seem to have a center which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great i enjoy the story of willie and missy they re both great role models plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story 
that reviewers liked this movie surprises me the plot is a muddle the characters are wooden michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them no one has any redeeming quality or point of interest this is not an edgy work it is not imaginative it is not ironic it is no clever there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work that is missed theatrical release is not surprise that the this network airs it diminishes that venue i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television if you encounter it on daytime television take a long walk even if you walk in smog you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles life is short this movie is long 
beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movies ever made yet retains an affection in my heart because the poverty of its special effects and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minutes combine to create something that is hilariously side splitting br br the opening scene in space is just about as unfathomable as cinematography gets as washing up liquid bottles whiz past your eyes to muffled dialogue before you ve had time to work out whether it s you who s gone mad the credits roll and the action struggles to life br br and aside from the double headed plasticine giant snail that terrorises our heroes you also get the added double bonus of having both the original actors voices and the dubbed voices at the same time pure genius br br the sad thing for fans of this kind of fare is that i ve only ever seen one copy so the chances of ever seeing it yourself is highly unlikely perhaps i own the only copy in existence br br 
i have always admired susan sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor i therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts her character s rescue from the south pole was done by a canadian charter company from edmonton alberta flying a canadian designed and built twin otter aircraft the trip had been turned down by the us airforce navy and coast guard as beyond their capabilities the same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the south pole base i feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task i fail to see why the producers would find it necessary ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a usaf hercules 
this is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major hollywood studio the plot is simply stupid the dialog is written in clichés you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this the acting is ridiculously bad especially that of rod cameron the choreography is silly and wholly unerotic one can only pity the reviewer who saw 23 year old yvonne s dance as sexual it s merely very bad choreography the ballet scene in the film s beginning is especially ludicrous if you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of hollywood s turkeys this is for you i bought the colorized version on vhs making the movie even worse yvonne s heavy makeup when colored has her looking like a clown all the time and she s the best part of this film what a way to launch a career 
daraar got off to a pretty good start the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next other than that the first half of the movie is a total bore all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla by the way don t you think he s a little old for her br br things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband and wow what a lunatic is he he was an over protective neat freak with a really hot temper he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason one of the reasons i really don t like this movie is because i can t stand to see juhi get so abused this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed i find it so sickening br br anyway all i m trying to say is if you re thinking about renting daraar you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else 
this film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes the problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking to pad out the running time the film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras for a zombie cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then i probably didn t see an uncut version 
ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make money the producers obviously didn t care about killing a classic horror movie i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg 13 how many pg 13 slashers movies have turned out to be good thats like asking how many women have been on the moon the answer is none prom night 1980 was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that br br my problem with prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him    br br 1 the way he escapes he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent what the hell why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something 2 his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her so does he want to kill her love her or just plain rape her 3 the killer is too good how did he develop all of his skills he used to be a teacher so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn t notice it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible silly stupid attempt at a horror movie
i m trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i m thinking matrix i m thinking bladerunner i m thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we ll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes right br br flashy shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact 
a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo both zombie related but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too br br the zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen in fact i must confess so bad was it i fast forwarded through most of the garbage and there was a lot of that believe me it runs for just 69 minutes and there is still tons of filler you get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups plenty of dull kissy kissy scenes between goofy teens and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors br br as for the title characters they barely even have a footnote in the film why you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature though considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are maybe that s a blessing in disguise br br and to top it all off it looks likes it s been filmed on someone s mobile phone for broadcast on youtube jerky camera work scratches on the print flickering lights i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in 2001 and not 1971 even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date br br if you think i m not qualified to do a review of chronicles having not seen the whole film then go ahead you try sitting through it i betcha you won t even make it to the first appearance of the blue smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it and honestly you ll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this gigglesome excuse for horror in fact don t for surprised if it packs it s bags and leaves in the morning leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life you have been warned 0 10 br br p s what kind of 18 rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene see the movie can t even get that part right 
whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about lucille ball especially her autobiography i ve never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in celoron and jamestown to her later years with desi i could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages in all i believe that lucille ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves if i were lucie arnaz and desi jr i would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film the filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me 
 the crush is a pleasant enough 40 something friends romantic chick flick for the first two thirds or so as it tries to be a brit sex and the city br br i particularly enjoyed the turn around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out br br they sure make a lot more deal of young man older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina or for that matter with the douglas zeta jones or dion svengali nuptials br br surrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies such as tart tongued anna chancellor br br the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina but it wasn t until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong just as with sex and the city the writer director is male here first timer scot john mckay and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work which would have been a better and more interesting movie the working title for the film was the sad f cker s club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obvious br br 
there is a reason this went straight to video the story is smarmy nick cage plays johnny in a sleazy way sex in churches and other scenes that border on tasteless taint this movie judge reinhold as the cuckold is okay but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done but it is a good film for trivia contests because so few people saw it 
unfortunately one of the best efforts yet made in the area of special effects has been made completely pointless by being placed alongside a lumbering silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate clichéd screenplay hollow man is a rather useless film br br practically everything seen here has been done to death the characters the idea and the action sequences with the only genuinely intriguing element of the film being the impressive special effects however it is just the same special effect done over and over again and by the end of the film that has been done to death also i was hoping before watching hollow man that the invisible man theme which is hardly original in itself would be the basis of something newer and more interesting this is not so it isn t long before the film turns into an overly familiar blood bath and mass of ineffectual histrionics the mound of clichés piles up so fast that it s almost impressive br br on top of all this kevin bacon does a pretty useless job and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best good points might be a passable jerry goldsmith score a quite interesting use of thermal imagery and the special effects i was tempted to give this film three out of ten but the effects push hollow man s merit up one notch br br 4 10
even thought i m not the biggest of cher fans this movie was her crowning achievement granted there were long term side effects and risks of brain damage memory loss intellectual impairment upon the screening such a film a 1989 survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that one third of 300 moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80 claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds br br cher plays someone very un cher in this movie a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family they re anti american pro italian and always at each other in someway she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while a nice mamma s boy man and he asks her to marry him she says yes i loved her mom s questions do you love him loretta  no  good if you love him he ll drive you crazy because they know they can but you like him then  oh yeah he s a sweet man ma when johnny goes off to sicily to care for his dying mother he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who he s been estranged from for years br br this victory for human rights carries even greater significance as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment in 1938 italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs easing the job of slitting their throats cerletti was inspired and began experimenting with electroshock on humans developing the first electroshock machine broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern br br this was in so many ways an anti american movie it s about love to be sure but it s also about infidelity secrets lonely people and strange behavior brought on by american policies the characters from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant the aunt and uncle her parents and their problems the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters it s somewhat of a chick flick as it s how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp it s a cinderella story in many ways and that is every little girl s dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan br br assuming free and fully informed consent it is well to reaffirm the individual s right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses but we might ask ourselves whether we as fans of cinema though in no way sworn to any hippocratic oath should be offering it 
nu image ufo and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly 2 million some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both for 2 million br br mr hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at 20 million dollars but it s painfully obvious that this was probably produced for 750 000 if not considerably less than that few sets are utilized a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish br br it s painful to watch not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget br br those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by p t barnum 
 but the keyword here is usually i have been known to adore movies everyone thinks are dumb but in the world of b rated movies this one is z rated absolutely ridiculous the thing i respect about most of my favorite b rated movies are that they don t take themselves too seriously the makers of movies like that sort of treat the movie lightly even if it s a heavy topic i get the impression however that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously like they were putting together a 10 star classic complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots nevertheless despite all this i still gave it 4 out of 10 stars as i am biased towards movies like this if you re a b rated fan however i would try too hard to find this one 
 succubus the edited version of necronomicon geträumte sünden is a struggle to sit through even at a lean 76 minutes any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a coma br br jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever apparently this is one of the better of his 180 films it s hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there br br the unfathomable plot deals with franco s usual themes of sex violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of s m for good measure and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious br br i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this 
note i couldn t force myself to actually write up a constructive review of prom night it just can t be done instead i went through what i thought about while watching the movie br br things that i thought about while watching prom night br br i m so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it of course when i say elaborate deaths i mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach didn t the whole it s just a dream thing get ruined by dallas speaking of which i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death br br the film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clichés on two hands not a good sign br br even after just meeting the protagonist s boyfriend i m convinced he will die anybody want to place bets br br the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character donna he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom while there is no accounting for taste i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donna br br high schools allow proms to take place at hotels and doesn t keep track of the students apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please i suppose if this plot point wasn t in place the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom i suppose the trade off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything i ve already played count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat and guess how much money i have in my wallet and i m only in the 20 minute mark how else will i entertain myself br br note to self don t forget milk and bread on the way home br br dear screenwriter you ve used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year br br the 1980 version of this film wasn t that good but compared to this remake it was like citizen kane or at least the godfather it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many post halloween horror flicks and it did have a little twist at the end i miss jamie lee i wish she d act more br br apparently at prom there isn t much dancing going on instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college i hear all these colleges being brought up by name and i can t help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in br br the killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes that s the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room there is no trace of a struggle br br it s official the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer what triggered it was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building was it her constant dreams and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee or was it brittany snow s unconvincing performance i ll have to say it was all of the above br br okay who had he dies off screen in the third act you win the pot br br finally the movie is over my friend turns to me and says donna wasn t too smart that s the understatement of the week kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience br br i can t wait to get on rotten tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review br br i can t recommend this i refuse to recommend this this is as lazy of a horror film as any and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers and unfortunately for theater patrons alcohol isn t served br br rating out of  
wow what can i say about this film it s a lousy piece of crap i m surprised that it got rated as high as it did what s wrong with this film here s a better question what s not wrong with this film br br the story itself is just crap and cliché here s pretty much what it s about some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on gets killed and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge all of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film if you haven t seen this movie don t waste your time watching it also the second one isn t much better so don t bother watching that either i rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrow s outfit not because there was anything good about the movie i think you get the picture 
i m not sure this is a spoiler perhaps it is a public service if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer s voice over which states the u s has just surrendered to nazi germany on may 7 1945 to end wwii here are just a few of the problems with this close br br 1 the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their mind s eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion br br 2 the average person will really kick themselves that they did not watch one of these unholy fill in the blanks flicks created in their own head for free instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store br br 3 this end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii leading them to the conclusion that george w bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne 
what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written these women have no self respect or dignity the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys amanda bynes talent is completely wasted she was brilliant on all that and her own show why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid airhead desperate men chasing old maid wannabes is beyond me br br their plots and dialog remind me of the simpons homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen everyone should ask where s poochie all the talk centers on whining about some guy and then whining to some guy sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead then they get back together or break up at the end the 2 women are either shallow stupid or sex addicts the only word i can think of is sucks 
bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth rate spoof of springtime for hitler br br the girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the original br br if you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls 
with adam sandler br br this is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made it s about cruise ship waiter shecky wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship first off there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly it is so unfunny it s pathetic there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor but the f word is plentiful the budget is really low and that also ruins the film it takes place on a cruise ship but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras one of which is billy bob thornton the opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply and it is just pathetic i hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it too br br 86 mins rated r for language 
a truly truly dire canadian german co production the ever wonderful rosanna arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term problem child a few uears prior to the action the child murdered her father and mum took the fall for the offspring now she s moved up to the northwest us to start over but her child still has a problem in that she s devoted to her mother so devoted in fact that she kills anyone who might be seen as a threat to their bond br br unfortunately mandy schaeffer murders more than people she delivers such a terrible performance that she also wipes out the movie though the incoherent script useless direction and appalling music don t help any we re supposed to find her sexy and scary but she fails on both counts almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be amusing all condolences to miss arquette and jurgen prochnow both of whom are worthy of far more than this and both of whom are the only sane reasons for anyone to sit through this farrago br br one of the production companies is called quality international films not since the three hour love lies and murder has there been such a you must be joking credit 
if you ve ever seen an eighties slasher there isn t much reason to see this one originality often isn t one of slasher cinema s strongpoints and it s something that this film is seriously lacking in there really isn t much that can said about pranks so i ll make this quick the film was one of the 74 films included on the dpp video nasty list and that was my only reason for seeing it the plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at christmas time as they re in a slasher someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie the fact that this movie was on the video nasty list is bizarre because despite a few gory scenes this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone and gorier slashers than this didn t end up banned but then again there s banned films that are much less gory than this one anyway the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it as although the audience really couldn t care less who the assailant is by this point it is rather well done on the whole this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss 
the perfect murder is foiled when a wife who murders her husband with a poker has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit she fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband s corpse she decides to use an ax once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman s head to frame the killer for her husband s murder santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman s daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child br br this episode of tales from the crypt just recycles tired material involving the old santa kills theme while also adding the oft usedwoman murders her husband for a man she s been cheating with routine it s essentially trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac there s nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions not one of the show s highlights 
luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth unfortunately her role required no she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film luise s character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni s character set in ancient asia both actors were not asian but were very convincing in their roles i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for she must have been a breakthrough actress one of the first to method act this seems like something that hollywood does often al pacino has played an italian and cuban i felt luise s performance to be lackluster throughout and when she died she did not change in expression from any previous scenes she stayed the same throughout the film she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice if her brilliant acting was so subtle i suppose i did not see it 
prom night is about a girl named donna who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night and by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies br br now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg 13 horror movies that haven t been scary lately are you tired of stupid girl dialog oh my god and talking about girlish things and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian japanese and chinese films that pretty much sums up prom night but i m still not done with the review br br the only reason to see prom night is to crack a laugh at the kills if not don t see prom night you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall and by the way the deaths are repeating like 24 7 so not only aren t they scary but it s obnoxious by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of oh my gosh it s our prom i understand it s fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate br br if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films i d be the first one too i m not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick seriously don t spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a night to die for when watching the film br br 1 star out of 10 
i was really really disappointed with this movie it started really well and built up some great atmosphere and suspense but when it finally got round to revealing the monster it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems again whoop de do yet another nutjob movie like we don t already have enough of them br br to be fair the creep is genuinely unsettling to look at and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy but i m sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human albeit a twisted demented freakish one when i saw all the tell tale rats early on i was hoping for some kind of freaky rat monster hybrid thing it was such a let down when the creep was revealed br br on top of this some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense br br why the hell does the creep kill the security guard whats the point apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says hi i m a psycho and i live down here its stupid and only seems to happen to prevent franka potente s character from getting help br br what the hells he been eating down there i got the impression he was effectively walled in and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose so has he been munching rats all that time and if so why do they hang around him so much why is he so damn hard to kill he s thin malnourished and not exactly at peak performance but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that cripple the non psycho characters in the film br br the dvd commentary says we are intended to empathise with creep but i just find him loathsome its an effective enough movie but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick 
what does the executive producer do in a movie if i remember correctly it s the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he s a major hollywood player it s usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story screenplay not being up to scratch br br protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat likely as things progress ms davis finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the film s executive producer do you understand what i m saying about the story screenplay not being up to scratch exactly
i only rented this because i loved the first movie however calling it john carpenters vampires los muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film br br a tragic storyline terrible special effects and jon bon jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time it s not even comically bad br br what we end up with is a dull uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichéd acting it just reeks of low budget br br avoid like the bubonic plague 
it s hard to believe after waiting 14 years we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage the original was a high impact dark thriller that achieved cult status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven this film adds nothing delivers nothing and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels br br the opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self indulgent life of catherine tramell or is it sharon stone possibly a copulation of both br br if the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in b s 1 forget it you wind up with soft porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them it s interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte rampling was romping around in her skivvies via the 1966 georgy girl when ms stone was only 8 years old a very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here br br if you re a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system if not you might as well wait for the dvd release in the rated version unrated version collectors edition or ultimate version and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of basic instinct 3 at which point ms stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care

a young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up unfortunately the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad he wants his loot back when he discovers who has the bucks he begins trying to get it back he keeps getting foiled by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil man s hands sounds familiar i ll bet very predictable not interesting at all come up with something a bit different ok guys 
the good earth is not a great film by any means it is way to ordinary maybe it was different in the 1930 s but who would want to see the life of a farmer it is not very interesting to me yes luis rainer and paul muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long i could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act in short wang lung a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds the film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis 
as others have noted this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist s life and i for one was very annoyed and offended by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair by the implication that her rapist was responsible for awakening her talent by its complete disregard for her work by the way it turned her into a sex object on and on you get the idea also i find it disturbing that people who aren t familiar with gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her 
already his first claim that desires are always artificial is totally fallacious br br when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies or anything for that matter it s time for anyone to get their own although far far more intelligent than say paris hilton zizek s mouth spews just as much baloney as hers just a different kind he combines the worst from both his professional worlds psychoanalysis and philosophy both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b lls osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories to rant without a beginning or end and to connect concepts almost randomly in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love example there are three main marx brothers hence what a great idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness the id the ego and the super ego i m kind of surprised he didn t play a clip from snowhite and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah it s like the premise of schumacher s the number 23 play with numbers long enough and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want even linking ancient greeks with princess di s death br br however there is an entertainment element to tpgtc watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun why watch cuckoo s nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours it s like watching an amusing train wreck admittedly he is almost funny on one or two occasions br br i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an exalted intellectual social science giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought hence this much credit probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value and the few ones that do have some intelligence don t require a shrink turned philosopher to draw one a map to understand them unless one is a complete idiot zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days br br when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the psycho shower scene i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh s blood or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh s vagina with the blood flowing into it instead of out this representing some kind of clever irony speaking of which the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene his movies wouldn t have been the illogical far fetched crap that they often are the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden deep meanings and when you add zizek s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated i e the easily impressionable and the gullible br br zizek utters a number of funny things here one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work of a job well done don t laugh neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done the cleaning of a blood stained toilet while they were conceiving directing that scene talk about putting words into one s mouth but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to say br br i like zizek s initial thoughts on tarkovsky s terrific solaris but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in anti feminism and other nonsense into his theory br br zizek s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone i just want to play with it all day logic has its rules and is not supposed to be raped at least not publicly by the likes of him he seems to regard logic proof common sense and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys concepts to be either avoided twisted to fit the end goal or simply annihilated zizek is the lsd tripped hippie and all his favorite movies are his own personal 2001 s br br the fact that zizek over focuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often lack intelligence if anything such as hitchcock and lynch only further diminishes his already low credibility i was surprised de palma didn t feature more prominently that s another lame director who writes inept scripts zizek has a field day with lynch s incomprehensible lost highway there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it br br zizek s comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier s laughable ground breaking physical set up in dogville made me snicker br br however zizek doesn t only make up stuff as he goes along he also indulges heavily in the bleedin obvious like all social scientists he wraps his very trite observations into articulate and sometimes complex blankets of language after all sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it s what we already all know but told in an eloquent way which fools the more unobservant listener br br i was half expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie suit br br slavoj zizek soon as a stalker in a kid s park near you br br http rateyourmusic com list fedor8 150 _ worst _ cases _ of _ nepotism

after reading the book i loved the story watching the movie i was disappointed that so many changes were made it is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories only the names and some of the book s story remained read the book and you ll have a better understanding of the movie the book gives you a better development of the characters these characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them the locations were indeed in line with the book s descriptions some characters not included television has microwaved so many great books and stories this is a perfect example of that input from the author doesn t always insure a good movie but it can help sometimes 
after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the plunge and bought the dvd that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all the list of problems with the film could drag on forever chief amongst them is the film is simply too long it dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly br br secondly as many had pointed out from the trailers the special effects are anything but special the tripods looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade z 1970 s or 1980 s quality probably the worst effects of all were the horses which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved the heat ray effects were laughable as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles also pitiful was the thunderchild sequence in which the thunderchild described in the book as an ironclad ram looked nothing of the sort instead it resembled a world war 1 era destroyer complete with deck guns and torpedo tubes br br the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out mars to her in the sky well the sky is black but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight there is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape bathed in full sunlight and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars to detract even further the color of the scenes made no sense in some they are bathed in orange light in others green light in still others it s blue light in some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue the frame rate and camera is very shaky giving everything a stuttering look br br finally the acting is overall sub par one man portrays two characters who s sole difference was one lacked a mustache this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were the english accents even to american ears are outrageous br br in summary this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times i have not seen gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one because of it s poor quality in every respect must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out i would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the imdb rankings it s a pity that mystery science theater is not still around 
this movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power sentimentality and love triangle of emotions what really bothered me about this movie was the makers absurd notion of surrogate mother a whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man is not a surrogate mother neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother i have seen indian movies and television shows that made 10 to 15 years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible i realize that most bollywood movies aren t meant to be plausible but they don t pretend to be either this movie wants us to emote along with the characters but this can t done with such a ridiculous contrived conflict i would have expected better from abbas and mustan 
first it takes a full half hour to get hackman out of jail and to start doing the job what a waste of time we all know hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences then hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere simply proving to us that hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters again another 20 minutes then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife all of this should have taken 10 15 minutes at most simply as a set up for the real action intrigue and plot twists by the time the real action gets going i was so bored that i just wanted the movie to end hackman is great as usual and the other actors as well but this is a dud of the first magnitude 
a few years back the same persons who created paris j taime which was imperfect but very enjoyable created this piece of garbage about new york city br br in paris i love you created a feeling for paris it was made in many parts of beautiful paris br br in this current film i did not recognize new york city i did not feel that i was in the city of my birth br br new york does have 5 boroughs i saw no scenes in the bronx or queens there is one scene in brooklyn i saw no scenes in times square or greenwich village no scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres it does have a large cast most of the performers were not even stereotypes they were caricatures of the lowest sort br br the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know love br br a few of the films nominated for the razzie awards were far better br br ratings  20 points imdb 1 br br in my way of thinking i think the title should have been br br new york i hate you

preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings assuming the identity of a second unit director he murdered br br film pokes gleeful fun at hollywood with a tongue in cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actressesand dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight brian krause who i thought was dreadful overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced portrays the loud temperamental director who doesn t like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer alisonseem to be taking over the production andrew moxham is paul parsons who is the brother of a victim from the first film the film s dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all it s worth nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty with stanley as clever as ever using his brains to commandeer a film production killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work letting no one stand in his way that is until alison realizes who stanley really is alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subject what motivated stanley to kill why would he do such a thing and what led such a man down this dark path the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller of course you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley with a really ridiculous unbelievable conclusion regarding the killer s fate unlike the first film which was photographed with sophisticated polish director po chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not neededand rather annoy instead of impress this sequel to me just wasn t on target as much as the original with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious 
ok first the good cher s performance and the cinematography although i m no cher fan she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written the cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance br br the rest a thin plotline nicholas cage s performance and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an italian american family from new york firstly everytime time cage opened his mouth i cringed i don t know what kind of accent he was trying use i honestly don t it sure wasnt any new york or italian accent i ve ever heard it was quite surreal and it wasn t because i m some stickler for accuracy his voice just cloyed in my ears and i like nicholas cage in other performances secondly and this is purely anecdotal but i have many italian relations friends and acquaintances in new york city and frankly i ve gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided and that would be on a boring night at the house what a let down

creep is the story of kate an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station after somehow meeting workmate and would be rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the city s streets her story is linked to that of george an ex con working in the sewer system they meet in the final third of the film brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them br br the pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations from the tube station they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery most tube stations don t have toilets so how one has a surgery is beyond me naturally the film cares to explain that the surgery doesn t have running water yet it has electricity just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create br br the monster itself is a problem there s a complete lack of reasoning for its actions it just kills people for no obvious reason and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son and a few shots of some jars containing babies and yes it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak communicating only in raptor screams but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay hmm br br this doctor business leads to scene that is the film s desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch it just isn t enough the final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason george breaks down unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard yeah br br after starting out as a this could happen to anyone movie it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid 
sometime in 1998 saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand new ninja turtles live action series naturally being a fan of the tmnt back in the day this obviously peaked my interest so when i started watching the show to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement some time later i got a chance to revisit the series br br first off let s talk about some of the positives they managed to re create the turtles lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot and the turtle suits while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series br br people tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain and besides most fans don t realize or don t remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic the shredder was offed in the very first issue never mind the countless resurrections that would follow so on a personal standpoint i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorable br br unfortunately they end up replacing him with these original villains who as stated seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show and with these new magic wielding generics comes a new female magic wielding turtle the infamous venus de milo i ll be honest i never got comfortable with her i m not against the idea of a female turtle i m just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her make believe enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power fortunately they all share the spotlight together br br next mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it given time and maybe another season i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness but while the idea was sound the execution was flawed as it stands next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten 
five minutes after watching this i logged on to imdb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie genre horror it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself somethings gotta happen soon it did not when the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the writer director i ve never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i ve gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his works br br i was taken in by the plot summary please don t make the same mistake br br i gave this movie a 2 for the actors they were not bad and it wasn t there fault they got such bad direction 
this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany br br i find the wooden horse disappointingly boring the subject could have been thrilling suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled but the wooden horse is told in a very plain way it s a collection of plain and poorly told events with no suspension and thrill the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel but the events are so plain with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge the latter half of the film is even worse they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film i am disappointed by the wooden horse it wasted the potential to be a great film 
is it possible to give a movie no stars i suppose not however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you ll get my drift director and photographer timothy hines didn t have much of a budget compared to spielberg s herculean effort with the same material but that need not be an insurmountable handicap i ve seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring with hard work integrity and above all talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells novella and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its war of the worlds unfortunately hines failed in all these departments even if he had had spielberg s budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he s foisted on us br br primarily hines seems unable to tell a story thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records a guy walks down a country lane a lot he talks badly aped received english to some other guy then he walks down the same lane only shot from the back this time to show he s returning clever eh walking and talking for nearly an hour that s all that happens ok i ll grant that one extended excursion from the main character s house to the impact site on horsell common to show that it s a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful but half a dozen times back and forth back and forth et cetera et cetera with some yakkity yak in between remarkable the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature length film finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking or shrieking later we get staggering and wailing for dessert br br thankfully much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h g wells text else we d have no idea what is going on but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text to realize what words alone can t convey if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel why bother why not do a radio play orson welles made himself a household name doing just that however hines thinks he s a filmmaker so he s content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning br br secondly hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie but he has no idea how to use them now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy i believe good science fiction cinema doesn t need dazzling technical effects some really potent sci fi s have flourished on virtually none at all but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled the effects don t need to be complex they can even be crude but they must be handled well unfortunately hines effects are both crude and incompetent tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times and on ad nauseum crude technique is forgivable so you have a cg fire effect that s less than convincing fine we can work around that just don t use it too often and only show glimpses of it that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum throw it away it s not necessary you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string if you must use it go ahead but please don t show it twice but no hines won t listen we get the worst looking stuff used again and again gotta get those 180 minutes somehow boy br br next we have acting or more precisely too much acting whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out evidently hines thinks he s getting a bargain more fleeing in terror over there you quaking behind that tree let s have a real conniption fit this take you call that writhing in agony nonsense my grandmother can writhe better nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink they aren t even good amateurs but this needn t prove fatal many a good movie has been made with rancid acting that s what directors are for and editors which brings up another point who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory if america s butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef in spite of the near three hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie not sequences but single frames creating a herky jerky effect that s nauseating to watch maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890 s if he was i can say he doesn t know how to do it 
it was meant to be a parody on the lotr trilogy but this was one of the most awful movies i ve ever seen bad acting bad screenplay bad everything this is my personal opinion i don t doubt any second that there are people who ll like this sense of humor but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers i m working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas at the movies it was a nice success during the first two weeks but then when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good the movie dropped very fast in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore in the last ten years the two worst movies i ve seen are the ring thing and torque i can t decide which one was worse but i m happy that there a so many good movies so i don t have to think too much on this question 
i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the tmnt to be four brothers with their teacher splinter and their enemies and each one of the four brothers are named after the great artists name like leonardo michelangleo raphel and donatello so venus here doesn t have any meaning or playing any important part and i believe that the old tmnt series was much more better than that new one which contains venus as a female turtle will not add any action to the story we like the story of the tmnt we knew in 1987 to have new enemies in every part is a good point to have some action but to have a female turtle is a very weak point to have some action we wish to see more new of tmnt series but just as the same characters we knew in 1987 without that female turtle 
ned kelly the infamous australian outlaw and legend sort of like robin hood with a mix of billy the kid australians love the legend of how he stood up against the english aristocratic oppression and united the lower classes to change australia forever the fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70 immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film indeed quite a few so called facts in this film are on reflection a tad dubious br br i suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when in the opening credits it was claimed that this film is based upon the book our sunshine if ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book there it was this wasn t going to be a historical epic but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of ned kelly albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version br br unfortunately ned kelly is nothing more than an overblown hallmark channel real life historical drama wannabe the story plods along at an alarming rate the feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of costner s awful wyatt earp all those years ago simply put nothing happens in the film but it takes a long time getting to that nothing this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good however unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst oirish accent then you re gonna be disappointed between that the game of who has the stupidest beard  spot the obvious backstabber  and nature in australia including lions it is an experience similar to flicking through hallmark the history channel discovery channel and neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover yup nature pops up a lot as to fill even more time the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots and once all the native species are shown here s a circus to allow for a camel and a lion br br this is a turgid emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv there isn t even one good word i can say about this film even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here when one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head 
i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself but i just got back from this movie and felt i had to express my opinions let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan but what makes a horror movie i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development i know they often lack in horror movies but prom night looked like it didn t even put forth any effort in that department next we all love suspense that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises yeah prom night had none of that of course we like a terrifying killer prom night have that nope it has a pretty boy with a cute lil knife and when all else fails at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore and the occasional nude scene yeah well when you have a horror movie rated pg 13 like prom night they leave that stuff out too so with all of these elements missing i ask does this still count as a horror movie nope i d call it more of a comedy people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw semi pro that was supposed to actually be a comedy i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror all the good horror movies of the good ol days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money the people i went to see it with didn t even know this was a remake which made me mad i wonder what will happen when there s no more movies to remake where will horror go next 
there is no way to describe how really really really bad this movie is it s a shame that i actually sat through this movie this very tiresome and predictable movie what s wrong with it acting there is not one performance that is even remotely close to even being sub par soundtrack if we get orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film soundtrack okay but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days don t even get me started on the what the hell moments here are a few killer can move at the speed of light door opens actress turns no one is there turns back there is something sitting in front of her out of now where the killer shows up with a power drill a really big one the filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in but can i really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in i feel like one of the guards at the beginning of holy grail and want to say where d you get the power drill i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have 1000 words i will give this 2 out of ten stars one star for making me laugh and another star for all the cleavage seriously do not waste your time with this one 
it s the early 80s there s a group of suspiciously old looking teens and there s a maniac stalking around yes this is slasherville br br this movie is called pranks why is it called pranks i haven t the faintest idea unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone s dinner with a baseball bat on balance not a great prank in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told but there you go br br the film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory they become aware that a psychopath is on the loose to combat this development they split up and wander about in the dark it ends in tears for most of them br br pranks is a badly made slasher movie the dvd release i viewed was the vipco one it appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence this makes the dvd even more pointless because let s face it a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time for slasher film and video nasty completists only 
the last reviewer was very generous i quiet like the first movie but can t say i enjoy this one very much the beginning is bearable but it goes downhill pretty quickly i just don t see jon bon jovi as a bad ass vampire hunter and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary a lot of the scenes just do not make sense i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you let alone an experienced hunter why una is able to communicate with jovi nothing was ever explain in this movie you wouldn t mind if it was entertaining but that was too much to ask this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen 
mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do br br but come on hollywood a mountie telling the people of dawson city yukon to elect themselves a marshal and to enforce the law themselves then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town br br nothing even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush mr mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood the canadian north for the american wild west br br canadian viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot or to shake your head in disgust 
i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked buffet froid from this director but the script of les acteurs is very poor why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario 
prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film you know the one this october lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex boyfriend it s dramatic  it s sappy  it s immensely dull it does nothing to further a genre tell an original story or strive for any sort of newness prom night shares this plight watching the killer poke holes in his victims we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history br br our director is working with a fairly good looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife you d probably go  oh good lookin guy is going to kill me naaaa not scary even for a second so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator you ll get 15 jump scares in this film 2 of which made my date jump i d also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me br br as if this film were not disjointed enough it appears to be cut to shreds i m not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film i m saying as the film moves from scene to scene you often get a jarring jump this is the kind of thing you d expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together cross his fingers and hope for the best the editor should be shot br br with a plot you can pack into two sentences one stray spray of blood an emo killer and the tension of a very special episode of silver spoons we re left with no reason to support horror this weekend  at least on the big screen in fact this is the sort of film that should be punished is it really that hard to make a scary movie was this crew even aware they were making a horror film  a complete waste of my time and yours i bit the bullet to get you this review don t let my sacrifice be in vain don t go into the movie 
i was lured to see this movie by its starpower but ultimately that s all it delivers it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption it s greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense we know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like dominoes the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way all the flavor of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola q a which also takes place in new york is a far better alternative as is la confidential 
this has to be the worst movie i have seen madsen fans don t be drawn into this like i was he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t v had been destroyed 
this movie is not as good as all the movies of christ i ve ever seen and i m quite amazed that in this story pilate wants to finish jesus when the scriptures state differently it lacks also a very important issue the resurrection none of the other movies skip this very important part the faith of all of us christians lies in this very event as paul says in one of his letters if christ did not rise from the dead our faith is vain a very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when jesus entered jerusalem br br finally and in opposition to my jewish co commentator jesus was not a myth and as a matter of fact he was also a jew there are plenty of documents that prove the existence of this extraordinary man that indeed changed mankind i strongly advise him to read about flavius josephus the most brilliant jewish commentator of the 1st century 
thanks to the bbc for this show i used to suffer from an inferiority complex i hated leaving the house talking to new people and i had an overwhelming sense that people hated me however after watching one episode of 4 non blondes my fortunes started to change after episode 2 i started applying for new jobs wearing fashionable clothes and i actually felt talented when the series had finished i was running the sales department at work banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local if you ever have a confidence crisis and don t know where to turn then take a trip down to poundland and pick up the dvd it s only 99p 
unwatchable you can t even make it past the first three minutes and this is coming from a huge adam sandler fan 1
this is said to be a personal film for peter bogdonavitch he based it on his life but changed things around to fit the characters who are detectives these detectives date beautiful models and have no problem getting them sounds more like a millionaire playboy filmmaker than a detective doesn t it this entire movie was written by peter and it shows how out of touch with real people he was you re supposed to write what you know and he did that indeed and leaves the audience bored and confused and jealous for that matter this is a curio for people who want to see dorothy stratten who was murdered right after filming but patti hanson who would in real life marry keith richards was also a model like stratten but is a lot better and has a more ample part in fact stratten s part seemed forced added she doesn t have a lot to do with the story which is pretty convoluted to begin with all in all every character in this film is somebody that very few people can relate with unless you re millionaire from manhattan with beautiful supermodels at your beckon call for the rest of us it s an irritating snore fest that s what happens when you re out of touch you entertain your few friends with inside jokes and bore all the rest 
it might have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the russian group t a t u coincidence i don t think so there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous you know the recipe the other actors well i just don t know what their role is supposed to be most of them are well known people in romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors so to summarize it girl band tatty desperate publicity needing actors a non existing plot the occasion to use bad language in order to shock love sick too bad the idea was good though and i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title 
i rented this movie about 3 years ago and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made i don t think i ever finished it it is worse than a home video made by a high school student i remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt oakley sunglasses and a newer suv like a toyota rav 4 or something i don t understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s he might have had a cell phone too i cant remember it was just horrible i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen some pretty bad ones 
it occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films i d like to argue that instead of banning challenging controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your iq and your sanity if they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be stroker ace this film is awful with a capital a it is the worst film burt reynolds ever starred in  quite a feat for for a man with cannonball run ii cop and a half and rent a cop on his cv br br the wafer thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer stroker ace a man who loves fast cars and fast women he gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter clyde torkle the contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants such as dressing up as a giant chicken thrown into the mix are lugs ace s dim witted pal and pembrook feeney a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by ace br br hal needham the director of this low grade garbage was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases races some of these films were ok like hooper and stunts unlimited but with stroker ace he reaches a career nadir the characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair the humour is weak and infantile throughout and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable even the out takes during the closing credits are generally unfunny which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn t much fun to make stroker ace is a stinker of considerable magnitude 
i didn t know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian history particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukon br br i ll leave it to pierre berton noted historian born and raised in dawson city yukon and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush klondike the last great gold rush 1896 1899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie br br the american idea of an untamed frontier subdued by individual heroes armed with six guns was continued in the far country another story about a cowboy from the american west wyoming this time driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle the customs shack is empty br br where is the constable asks brennan br br up on the pelly river trouble with the chilkats someone replies he s got a real tough job that constable he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles sometimes he don t get home for two or three months at a time br br the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense they collected customs duties often over the wails of the new arrivals made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation and turned men back if they didn t have enough supplies or if they simply looked bad in true canadian fashion they laid down moral laws for the community in dawson the lord s day act was strictly observed it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday and plump young women were arrested for what the stern faced police called giving a risqué performance in the theatre generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights br br in such a community a gunbelt was unthinkable one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over no man has yet taken a gun away from me said the american well i m taking it the constable said mildly and did so without further resistance so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece br br in 1898 the big year of the stampede there wasn t a serious crime let alone a murder in dawson the contrast with skagway on the american side which was a lawless town run by soapy smith the denver confidence man was remarkable but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law which a soapy smith character from skagway he is called gannon in the picture can easily control br br in the movie the lone mountie says yes i m the law i represent the law in the yukon territory about fifty thousand square miles of it br br then why aren t there more of you br br because yesterday this was a wilderness we didn t expect you to pour in by the thousands now that you re here we ll protect you br br when br br there ll be a post established here in dawson early in may br br what happens between now and may you going to be here to keep order br br part of the time br br what about the rest of the time br br pick yourselves a good man swear him in have him act as marshal br br the movie mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture his astonishing suggestion that an american town marshal complete with tin star be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under british jurisprudence is accepted naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the marshal he clearly fits the part but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot and he does others get shot even walter brennan gets shot stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own he pins on the tin star and he and the bully gannon blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax br br to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north this bald re telling of the story passes rational belief br br excerpt from hollywood s canada by pierre berton 1975 
c mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode it s just an old 60 s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages br br this use of an outdoor location gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show br br except a few notable exceptions i e the city on the edge of forever  assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth balled and put out of it s boring misery half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average br br this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made a lot of rubbish he doesn t deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example br br just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what 
i saw this movie about 5 years ago and the memory of it still haunts me to this day i was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it so i have only myself to blame but like most i didn t believe all the negativity being a sandler fan it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad i figured it was just sandler haters i couldn t have been more wrong br br what we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny that is actually quite an accomplish you d think in a 90 minute comedy they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing but no it s just horrible it s not so bad it s good its just bad you cannot laugh at how bad it is you can only cry you wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle but they never come br br have you seen the movie the ring where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later if this movie was on the video tape people would die instantly by their own hand and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended and that would be the first smile since they pressed play br br you might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is unable to curb your curiosity don t please don t trust me i m doing you a favor there are 2 types of people in the world those that think going overboard is the worst movie ever made and those that have not yet seen it 
return to cabin by the lake just  was lacking it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera so within the same scene you ll have some movie quality camera shots and simple video camera shots it makes for a very odd blend i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect br br i think it s worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original cbtl because then you can compare and see the differences but if you haven t seen the original cbtl  you ll never want to see it if you see this one first it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one 
it s not really about gymnastics swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery or microbiology or a booger flicking tournament instead like every other rocky flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market it s about conquering adversity with stick to it iveness rendering all social personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome with love interest standing by of course ronald reagan top to bottom in short so as a piece of cinema it s down to the details some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up especially the love interest brought to you by none other than mr keanu reeves warming up for ted heroine olivia d abo s hateful alkie dad and big hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch nemeses teammates one of whom appears to be made of porcelain it s my instinct to be appalled by the comic relief black guys but on the other hand at least they re in the movie but d abo doesn t quite convince with her awkward girl shtick and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter it s all just bodies hurtling around and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion it s all performed by an obvious double 
 prom night is a title only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred jamie lee curtis and leslie nielsen this movie takes place in an oregon town where donna is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years she and her friends arrive at the prom which is taking place in a grand hotel and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives little does anyone know a man from donna s past who has haunted her for years is also at the prom and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her br br i m a fan of the original prom night so i tried to maintain a little hope in this movie but i have to admit i was quite disappointed prom night suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have and that is predictability there are absolutely no surprises here and i felt i had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times often better before what does this equate to for the audience boredom unless of course you have never seen any horror movies or are part of the pre teen crowd but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen the plot is simplistic but the entire script is void of any type of surprise twist atmosphere or anything and this really really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into it all just seemed very bland br br a lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a pg 13 slasher movie as well and i understand what they are saying but i don t think it s impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore take carpenter s halloween for example little to no on screen violence but still an extremely frightening and effective movie you don t need gore to make a film scary but even had prom night been gratuitously violent it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with the tension and suspense here is mild at best and i spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations and was correct about 99 of the time our characters aren t well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them and their by the numbers demises are routine and careless br br i will point out a few things i did like about this movie though because it wasn t completely useless the cinematography is really nice and everything was very well filmed and fairly stylish among the jump scares there were a few that were kind of clever the sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold however predictable the unfolding may be as for the acting it s mediocre at best brittany snow plays the lead decently but really the rest of the cast doesn t show off much talent johnathan schaech plays the villain and is probably the most experienced performer here but even he isn t that impressive however i did like the character he played which was a nice change from the typical masked stalker type killer we see a lot as far as the ending goes the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit s end and it was very anti climactic br br overall prom night was a disappointment everything was very by the numbers routine and predictable which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie there were a few neat moments but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere and had little plot development nor believable characters i d advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it s out on video or rent the original instead because there are absolutely no surprises here some may find a little entertainment in it but it was far too predictable for my tastes i expected better and left the theater very disappointed 3 10 
i can t believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie that s all i ve got to say the movie speaks for itself 
kubrick meets king it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980 i remember then the movie came out and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever since br br the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it the kubrick cultists don t give a damn about king s story they talk about steadicams tracking shots camera angles this is a film they insist it should be considered on its own as it happens both camps are correct unfortunately br br if one views it purely as an adaptation of king s novel the shining is indeed a failure a wasted opportunity a series of botched narrative gambits br br i used to blame that on kubrick s screenwriter the writer diane johnson has a reputation as an novelist of social manners maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics but the little blue collar town of sidewinder colorado doesn t exist on any map in her francophile universe br br kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial however he of course is the real auteur and considered on its own merits his screenplay for the shining  with its mishmash of abnormal psychology rationalism supernaturalism and implied reincarnation just doesn t stand up to logical analysis br br i m willing to consider kubrick s shining on its own terms i m even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror genre movie but it doesn t succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation alienation and madness either parsed either way the film pretty much falls apart br br are the horrors of the overlook hotel real or do they exist only in the mind first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance then as the hallucinations of his father one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a ghost he is in fact looking into a mirror one notes how the hotel s frozen topiary hedge maze appears to symbolize jack s stunted convoluted psyche very deep stuff br br but if indeed the overlook s ghosts are purely manifestations of jack torrance s growing insanity then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchen s dead bolted walk in closet so that he can go on his climactic ax wielding rampage br br and can anyone explain with a straight face that black and white photograph of nicholson as a tuxedoed party goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel ballroom wall during the film s closing seconds are we to seriously conclude that jack torrance s bad craziness stems from a some sort of past life experience br br maybe kubrick didn t care about his storyline maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror whatever the case the film tries to hedge its narrative bets to have it both ways rational and supernatural as a result the story is a mess this movie hasn t improved with age and it certainly doesn t improve with repeated viewings br br i don t deny that a few moments of fear claustrophobia and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long long film but those gushing elevators o blood seen repeatedly in little danny s visions are absurd and laughable and jack torrance s infamous tag lines merely puncture the movie s dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy finally kubrick is completely at sea or else utterly cynical during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son a foyer full of mummified guests all sitting there dead in their party hats yikes now i really am afraid br br given jack nicholson s brilliance over the years one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball rolling eyebrow wiggling scenery chomping performance that the director wanted the performance of shelley duvall as a sort of female version of don knotts in the ghost and mr chicken is best passed over in silence br br this movie simply doesn t succeed not as an adaptation not on its own terms it probably merits a 3 out of 10 but i m giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely over rated in this forum 
this has to be by far the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last 20 years when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn t be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films and he was a pretty fair actor wrong no one should waste their time on this film i fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and i don t feel that i missed a thing 
garson kanin wrote and directed this look at modern day las vegas and the gap between generations his first directorial effort since the 1940s david janssen is somewhat miscast as a big shot casino owner who reunites with his son janssen approaches every scene the same way defensively with a chip on his shoulder playing this role cool and laid back is asking too much from janssen who barks at everyone like a grouchy put upon husband his son a ne er do well in search of his own identity makes hip comments about how young people look down on vegas and his disapproval of dad s lifestyle causes friction brenda vaccaro is cute as a self conscious secretary and edy willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition unfortunately where it s at doesn t have much else going for it other than the now dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids some quick t a shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high stakes world of gambling most of which has been covered by now ad nauseum  from  
within the realm of science fiction two particular themes consistently elicit interest were initially explored in the literature of a pre cinematic era and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike with varying degrees of success the first theme that of time travel has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film as well as the written word most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h g wells classic the time machine the second theme which also manages to hold audiences in thrall is that of invisibility which sparks the imagination with it s seemingly endless and myriad possibilities and this theme too has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h g wells classic the invisible man the realization of which here is hollow man directed by paul verhoeven and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue br br sebastian caine and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u s government exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility which they have at last achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method they have in fact progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original visual state of being it s a problem however that caine after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab has solved or so he thinks and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful he decides to present the results to the board of directors in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project br br at the last minute though caine demurs fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level the testing of a human subject and he takes it upon himself to become that subject securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they ve been given approval by the board to do so but something goes wrong and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it s too late it all begins to take a toll on caine s mind and suddenly his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that now there s a very real chance that he may lose everything including himself br br verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting even thought provoking film he establishes a good pace and uses the f x at his disposal to great effect though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development anyone familiar with the invisible man or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times still verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood and gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he s worked for earlier in the film rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caine s suffering and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it s inevitable conclusion verhoeven takes the low road and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind along with anything that would have made this a memorable film and it s a shame because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower br br kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable if only on the surface which seemingly serves verhoeven s purposes perfectly there s little depth to bacon s portrayal but it has more to do with his director s agenda than his own acting abilities verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story and toward that end it works the film would have been better served however had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part something that would have drawn them in a bit rather than leaving them at the gate as it were as mere observers of an f x laden extravaganza br br elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay caine s willing accomplice in the ill fated experiment but it s basically a thankless part that offers little challenge especially to an actor of shue s caliber the same can be said of kim dickens her character sarah kennedy does little more than support the action and f x both actors are capable of so much more and deserve better than what they are given to work with here br br the supporting cast includes josh brolin greg grunberg joey slotnick mary randle and william devane entertaining to a point and even successful on a certain level hollow man is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been like an annual fireworks display it will give you some momentary thrills but after awhile it ll begin to blend in with all the others you ve seen without anything special to set it apart and it s too bad because given the talent and abilities of those involved here it could have been so much more i rate this one 4 10 br br  br br  br br 
i really wanted to like this movie i absolutely love kenny hotz and spenny rice has a charming side to him not that i like spenny at all spenny ruins this movie he should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie br br anyways it s pretty boring aside from a scene with roger ebert in it there really isn t too many celebrities in this movie and most don t seem to say more than one line overall this movie was disappointing i would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 dvd of kenny vs spenny regardless of this production i am still very excited to check out the papel chase 
this sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb nazis occult government conspiracies i was expecting a low budget nazi version of the davinci code or the boys from brazil or even shockwaves instead you get something quite different more psychological more something like from david lynch that was actually a plus but the way the story is told is just awful br br part of the trouble is the casting andrienne barbeau s character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid she just doesn t do that well even at her age though she certainly tried the actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie or at least acted like it rather than simply being quirky the only one that i thought did really well was the daughter siri baruc br br another big part is the pacing it starts off very slowly so slowly you might be tempted to turn it off but then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter s suicide and the aftermath but shortly afterward it all becomes a jumbled mess some of this was on purpose but much of it was just needlessly confusing monotonous and poorly focused br br the real problem is it s simply not a pleasant movie to watch it s slow dull none of the characters are likable overuse of imagery and sets some movies you see characters get tortured in this it s the viewer that does it does have a few creepy moments most notably the creepy nazi paintings and the credits but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome 
i remember i saw this cartoon when i was 6 or 7 my grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall i remember that it really sucked the plot had no sense i hated the fox that became casper s friend he was so stupid casper cried his head off if he couldn t find a friend so what get over it the only good part and i don t want to sound mean spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end i laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much the bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost i wish he had stayed dead i think i even gave the video of this to somebody because i hated it no wonder they were offering it for free at the mall if you have a child don t let them watch this they will probably agree with me that it sucks 
going into this movie you know that this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible maniac so right away you re guessing who will live and who will die the survivors end up being exactly who you d expect them to be so no points for plot twists there br br and if you re not sure if this is a b movie or a movie that just happens to take place in a lab with an engaging story william devane plays a part instant b movie status br br the movie is promising in the beginning at the lab we are introduced to the invisible gorilla who is becoming increasingly violent oooh foreboding the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again great special effects same thing when they make bacon invisible br br there are a couple of bare breasts a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing to give this movie an r rating that it really didn t need br br for a thriller there weren t really any surprises except when shue makes like macgyver in the freezer which is more of a whaaaa ok there is one surprise that s when caine comes back one last time in the elevator shaft it was a surprise but only because you re yelling at tv noooo you re dead already end the movie speaking of yelling at the tv that s all i did for the last 25 minutes or so put on your f ing goggles instead of putting their infrared goggles on so that they can see him they try every other trick in the book br br the story really lost it at the end but the special effects were good that s the only reason i give it a 2 10 
i m studying catalan and was delighted to find el mar a movie with mostly catalan dialogue at my art house video store br br hmmm not so delighted to have seen it br br yes as other reviewers have said it s well made and beautifully photographed although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent it s well acted and convincing oh well minor detail up to this point it had something of the feel of a non magical pan s labyrinth also set in the spanish civil war br br fast forward and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys manuel and ramallo both are patients i know but hey coincidences happen br br the problem as with so many spanish movies is that with one exception the characters are just so dang weird their motivations personalities and dialogue are often simply incoherent br br what s more it descends into some horrific wretched excess be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood the reviewer who called it a potboiler is quite on track if it had been made 40 years ago the poster would ve said see forbidden love rape murder mutilation fanaticism animal cruelty betrayal br br the opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable to work this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters as it is it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between brother sun sister moon and pulp fiction if that sounds like something you ve got to see by all means enjoy i think i go with something that doesn t make me feel i need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom br br as for the catalan it s the mallorqui dialect fairly different than the barcelona dialect though i was surprised by the comment that said that even barcelonans apparently needed catalan subtitles to understand it 
there are lots of extremely good looking people in this movie that s probably the best thing about it perhaps that even makes it worth watching br br loaded tells the story of tristan price a young man who s about to make his mark on the world he s the son of a well to do family with a good reputation and he s on his way to law school but like so many such settings things aren t quite as perfect as they appear the expectations in this family far outweigh the love except for school tristan s father rarely lets him leave the house this seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isn t spelled out until the very end tristan s claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation the celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party and from there tristan befriends sebastian cole who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld br br while technically well made this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isn t very engaging also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and out of place such as slow motion fast motion freeze frames and echos these are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a character s perspective while on drugs except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points in some cheap attempt at style br br despite its cast of relative unknowns performances were good all around most notably with respect to the main antagonist i suspect we ll be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future br br of course when mentioning the actors i must mention their looks rating based on hotness this movies scores an 11 the women in this movie are incredible looking and almost distract you from what a boring movie you re watching i m sure the male characters are also quite attractive but you ll have to ask someone else to comment on that br br overall i can t recommend this movie not for buying renting or even seeing for free it s unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through 
i don t care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie stunk i didn t know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with o j s attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health i have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie goer across the planet the whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the drama was emotionless i am thankful i didn t have to pay for this unfulfilling experience 
i wanted to see it because of two reasons one it was the remake of high sierra with bogart two the bogart part was played by jack palance whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility as in the big knife br br but now i wonder why they decided to shoot this remake the film follows the same plot as hig sierra only here the actors don t care the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking jack palance is getting bored looking at shelley winters and shelley winters is asking herself what she s doing in this film i don t even want to compare her to ida lupino in the same role and of course they had to use the dog story again they surely could have come up with some different ideas perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot high sierra but that definitely doesn t add any quality to the film br br it s a waste of time if you ve seen high sierra before otherwise why not see a pseudo film noir as for me i d rather die than see it one more time 
the good earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in china the movie is based on the novel by pearl s buck the story is great but i hated that they decided to cast anglos in the lead roles walter connolly is laughable as the farmer s father he has such a heavy american accent as do most of the lead actors that i could not bear listening to him speak br br it is a shame that hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast asians in the lead roles to take anglos and make them look like chinese is akin to anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play african americans 
mike hawthorneis witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father morty twenty years later mike gathers a group of his friends to his family s cabin in the woods for a halloween party while playing a game where the guests confess and confront their worst fears mike tries to summon the spirit of his late father it is soon discovered that morty s spirit inhabits a wooden indian in the cabin the statue comes to life and the blood bath begins br br most of the f x are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme stale story pitifully acted cast members of note are kelly benson phillip rhys emmanuelle vaugier byron chief moon and veteran actress betsy palmer 
this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny when i saw this film i saw it for john candy and assumed incorrectly that it would be hilarious instead there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat unfunny moments and to top it off candy delivered some of the crudest lines i had ever heard up to that time so despite a potentially funny cast and story idea we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult though teens will probably find a few laughs it s really a shame it could have been so much better i mean with eugene levy joe flaherty and john candy it should have been wonderful 
i really wanted to like this western being a fan of the genre and a fan of buffalo bill wild bill hickok and calamity jane all of whom are in this story add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor and it sounded great br br the trouble was  it wasn t i found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this being bored to death jean arthur s character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like buffalo bill cooper wasn t at his best either sounding too wooden this was several years before he hit his prime as an actor br br in a nutshell his western shot blanks head up the pass and watch another oater because most of em were far better than this one 
without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i ve ever seen this being one of them and camp blood being another br br the acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap br br i bought this for 1 but remember you can t put a price on 71 minutes of your life you d do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price 
this film was a major letdown the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean spirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead protagonist s character was as slimy as they come the sickroom hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over the top theatrics little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately i ve been to spain and realize this is not realistic in addition the use of same sex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed this film might especially appeal to you 
i didn t expect much from this tv movie you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr still it managed to disappoint failing even to be a good bad film br br every scene was by rote as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script leaned back and said my work is done it s all cliche all predictable and even worse the actors are forced to look like they re taking it seriously br br do yourself a favor watch the x files if you re in the mood for paranoia they handle it better also let anyone know that sitting through fatal error is just that 
new york i love you or rather should be titled manhattan i love looking at your people in sometimes love is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation case in point look at two of the segments in the film one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy talk and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books while the latter isn t a great story by any stretch it s at least something that has a beginning middle and end as the composer tries to score gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap and in the end gets some help from a girl he s been talking to as a liaison between him and the director the ethan hawke scene however is like nothing and feels like it like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in br br what s irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible stories and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another it s not even so much that the film set practically always in manhattan and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx lacks a good deal of diversity since there is some it s the lack of imagination that one found in spades for better or worse in paris j taime it s mostly got little to do with new york except for passing references and at its worst it s incomprehensible on a level that is appalling br br so basically wait for tv and do your best to dip in and out of the film in that is for three scenes the aforementioned bloom christina ricci segment which is charming the brett ratner directed segment with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary everything else can be missed even natalie portman s directorial debut and the return of a hughes brother to the screen a mixed bag is putting it lightly it s like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left 
 as if you wouldn t know how it ll end br br my expectations for hollow man were high a very good commercial a director like paul verhoeven and actors like kevin bacon and elisabeth shue plus a very interesting theme invisibility every premise for a great movie was accomplished unfortunately these things didn t matter at all the movie was very very week without suspense and awfully predictable br br it s all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility after the tests on animals succeeded kevin bacon decides to test it on himself once he s invisible he changes completely realizing the advantages of not being seen from this to murder there s a very thin line br br hollow man is an ill movie it suffers of the disease that many new movies have the special effects from a challenging theme that could have lead the producers to a great tensed psychological thriller verhoeven ruins everything focusing only on special effects without giving a damn about the real value of the movie i must admit the fx are awesome probably the best i have seen since matrix but that s not enough to make a movie good actually that s the problem with the movies today just like verhoeven most directors care only about spectacular scenes and nothing more the exceptions are very few and probably the matrix is the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great plot br br after starship troopers verhoeven disappoints again in stead of a great film hm is cr p there are only 2 reasons why you could watch this movie 1 the special effects 2 the joke with superman and wonder woman br br okay so what went wrong with the movie everything let s see what i can remember br br  it s not tensed at all it should ve been but it s not br br  it s too predictable you know from the beginning who will die and who will live br br  in stead of focusing on the psychological part verhoeven cares only about the effects br br  very many cliches br br  of course the bad guy wakes up a few times before dying br br  just like in every low quality horror the first rule is to let the characters separate as much as possible every time there is somebody alone in the lab perfect victim for bacon br br  some holes in the plot example at the beginning bacon has to scan his finger to enter the lab after he s invisible how can he do that br br  the ending absolutely horrible br br  after shue hits bacon in the head bacon falls down to the ground then shue and brolin leave quietly and slowly without looking back is that normal then bacon gets up attacks them they kill him again and then shue screams i heard an explosion and they suddenly run inside didn t she hear that explosion some time before br br  there s a scene in which you can see the microphones hanging above the actors come on mr verhoeven i expected much more from you br br so that s about hollow man what was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam br br vote 4 out of 10 
what ends up killing this movie is its self consciousness among other things here s a short list 1 irreverent behavior when the beatles came over and injected their brand of quirky irreverent behavior humor it was greeted as fresh that was over 4 decades ago get over it br br 2 false sophistication spewing out base quasi socio political isms is hard ground to make work comically ask woody allen br br 3 the post modern i m hard on this phony world and yes i recognize it in myself snake eating itself used as illustration with another animal in the film itself is such a retread br br 4 smarmy smug drollness br br 5 amateurish writing acting direction ever seen student films a victim of itself about the only thing i can say positive is that it at least has a sense of itself and sheesh now i m getting caught up in the self reflexive thing that it posits as worthwhile of value br br but towards what ultimately it just rings as hollow as any other pretentious piece hey ever see woody allen s take on bergman ie interiors  well this just does it more amateurishly 
this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989 his character s constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison unfortunately sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent successful and funny manner when this film was made much like his character the majority of the film s jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he s too ugly and can t get women the film is hard to watch too because it doesn t treat itself like a real film sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film often referring to the film s low budget or questionable content the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over for fear that if more found out about it it would ruin sandler s career pass this one up at the video store i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time 
on the 1998 summer blockbuster hit baseketball this is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo tron screen in a sports bar during the day when everyone is quite drunk unfortunately i was sober when i saw this movie br br so quoted the late gene siskel for this lame brained supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior there s something about mary in a one upmanship game during july of 1998 mary was a gross out fest but in addition to the many gags it had a lot of heart which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer br br baseketball tried to outdo mary but it fizzled in more ways that one you take the creators of south park trey parker and matt stone who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera the only member of zaz david zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck and the other two jim abrahams and jerry zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture a small bit by now 90 years young ernest borgnine wasting his precious time in his distinguished career dying on a hotdog and singing i m too sexy as he videotapes his will jenny mccarthy who has little screen time as borgnine s not too weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter a bigger female part by yasmine bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey robert vaughn as a corrupt archrival and pointless cameos by airplane alumni kareem abdul jabaar and the late robert stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it s much fresher humor created by the zaz family what do all these people make up a desperate cast and crew trying to replicate airplane humor and mixing it up with the crudity of south park but failing in every way br br to make this long 100 minute movie short baseketball a real game invented by david zucker and his friends in his hometown of milwaukee is about two lazy losers and their pint sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball together on the driveway of one s house after borgnine dies he bequeaths the ownership of his baseketball team the milwaukee beers to parker and stone sure enough the game goes national and archrivals vaughn and mccarthy want to take away ownership of the beers team from them but bleeth is in love with both men particularly parker and one poor sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga ga over them those are the characters not strongly developed br br now witless gags ensue blood electroshock hair egg throwing and screaming are among them parker and stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital but he pulls through the liver transplant borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will mccarthy who seemed to get over borgnine s death by choking on a frank right away quickly massages vaughn in the next scene cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits there is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing and david zucker forces the parodies of riverdance and titanic parody forcing is nothing new to zaz post airplane and the naked gun series br br and like siskel i was sober as well but i was also getting sleepy this movie should be played over and over to coarse mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers but will they remain alert and awake or pass out during the unfunny parts if they pass out then they won t realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity hats off to them 
the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea and the subject matter is of quite a bit of interest but throughout watching this film we were saying aloud these filmmakers go to the trouble of finding good locations the lighting is good makeup and hair are good why is the sound so bad throughout the film the sound was echoy garbled and much of the dialog was unintelligible br br there is some good acting in this film and i think jim thalman is really a good actor this story with some of the same actors would have been worth doing as a high budget film br br i just can t reiterate enough if you have a limited budget dedicate more to good sound sound is as much a part of a film as the image and it s worth doing right could ve earned a 6 
a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing the movie twists and turns through miriad plot surprises at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing offcourse puncturing the plot with steamy scenes they thought would help it along br br james belushi is involved in this pseudo intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie the same applies for the other actors the plot is quite silly and tacky whih in itelf is not such a crime but towards the end the tremendous plot twists get very tiresome and boring br br however the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day but don t fret if you miss this one br br a rather lame 4 
i rented i am curious yellow from my video store because of all the controversy that surrounded it when it was first released in 1967 i also heard that at first it was seized by u s customs if it ever tried to enter this country therefore being a fan of films considered controversial i really had to see this for myself br br the plot is centered around a young swedish drama student named lena who wants to learn everything she can about life in particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average swede thought about certain political issues such as the vietnam war and race issues in the united states in between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of stockholm about their opinions on politics she has sex with her drama teacher classmates and married men br br what kills me about i am curious yellow is that 40 years ago this was considered pornographic really the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between even then it s not shot like some cheaply made porno while my countrymen mind find it shocking in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in swedish cinema even ingmar bergman arguably their answer to good old boy john ford had sex scenes in his films br br i do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in america i am curious yellow is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes of swedish cinema but really this film doesn t have much of a plot 
this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies once again it doesn t make since the killer still kills for fun but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie which means that it is the stupidest movie ever br br don t watch this if you value the one precious hour during this movie then don t watch it you ll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it because it just doesn t combine the original makes of horror action and crime br br don t let your children watch this teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people 
after eagerly waiting to the end i have to say i wish i wouldn t have joined the whole series at the first place the final episode was everything against the previous seven years it has ruined everything the journey was 23 years but captain janeway has the power to reduce it let say seven years only why seven why not just one or nothing why not avoid the whole adventure crewmemebers were dying all along the journey why she wants to save seven of nine only the others don t count or what the most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them as the say journey is more important than the destination unbelievable and at the finale scene the are surrounded by other federation ships and the earth is in sight nothing about landing returning to the normal life br br worst ending ever 
i am compelled to write a review of this imax feature as a means of warning others to save your money almost any episode of desmond morris the human animal or david suzuki s the nature of things could have bested the material presented not only does the director fail to make use of imax s incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather her husband buster and their niece and nephew we follow them for an interminable forty odd minutes as they eat sweat listen to music etc although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies natural diving reflexes do we really learn anything more than most grade school graduates are we even remotely entertained by the trans atlantic heather do we care avoid this film at all cost if you do wish to see an imax feature i suggest the beautifully photographed india kingdom of the tiger or the technically thrilling space station 3d trust me 
after a day at work i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started the first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting all in all don t plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night 
andie mcdowell is beautiful as the 40 ish woman whose late start at a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a subsequenet falling out with 2 long time best girldfriends br br seeing a gigolo gold digger in the sincere young man the girl friends dead set on terminating this silly relationship go over and beyond the call of duty in helping out their friend will be very disappointed on a scale of 1 to 10 this one ranks a weak 4 with me there is much better material out there this one isn t worth your time 
first off let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie this entire movie had to have been a dare you know like dude i bet you couldn t make the worst movie ever with this movie they ve made a good effort at achieving that title the effects are of course poor the plot dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every b horror movie ever made the actors i m assuming are supposed to be in college yet parts of it make it seem like they re supposed to be in high or middle school it makes no sense the scarecrow going around killing people isn t the least bit enjoyable 
to movie this movie felt like one of those after school specials only lower budget and lower everything else i guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some sort but it didn t work for me yet some how it comes across as preachy it has very pale shades of flash dance but so what there just isn t any excitement in this movie the dialogue is contrived and clichéd to death of course the whole movie feels like a bad 80 s cliché the acting was less than stellar though that has a lot to do with what the actors were givento work with on top of that is the poor song choices with really bad lyrics i felt embarrassed for all the actors involved they are all talented but you can t tell from this movie this is just my opinion of course but i have to give flying aka dream to believe a 1 10
this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen worse than the most abhorrent american dross worse than glitter mariah carey in american dross par excellence i can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea it s not it is abject rubbish from very bowels of satan himself robert jones as exce producer spending our tax payers money on this piece of nonsense should be accountable who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re make deathline i ask you camp as a christmas tree deathline mind the doors is classic of really bad british film we really don t need a reminder and we certainly don t need a poor second rate badly scripted badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this all this this from the uk funding agency that brought us sex lives of the potato men i rest my case br br do not pay any money to see this it is absolute and utter crap the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash our cash for making it they should hang their heads in shame br br i am staggered at the low low standard of this film it makes me mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting there is no hope for the british film industry whilst idiots are running the show harvey wienstein where are you come back we forgive you 
there are only two movies i would give a 1 10 to this stinker and the man who fell to earth i remember seeing protocol at a theater in the early 80s when i was in high school the script is insulting to anyone intelligence it completely lost me with the hillarious gag of someone getting shot in the butt goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic then there are offensive stereotypes about arabs followed by goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble the acting was terrible including goldie hawn s i could not stand to see another movie she was in until imo she redeemed herself in everyone says i love you this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing the worst 
the story of a woman on her death bed her two daughters and her thoughts about her past the flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young ann is in the wedding of her friend lila at the wedding she meets harris who will impact her for the rest of her life through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love her daughter constance is older more responsible a mother of two and has things together nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life br br first of all the good the period detail in the movie is great the dresses hair cars houses etc really put you in another time and place and there is some very quality acting in the movie vanessa redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end claire danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young hugh dancy brought a lot of life to the character of lila s brother buddy br br now for the bad which unfortunately is everything else things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us the chemistry between young ann and buddy is great they have fun and dance then you are supposed to believe that she doesn t really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her and i thought the whole he might be gay thing was out of the blue and didn t serve a purpose br br then we have harris the character acts wooden and creepy had this been another genre you would have known that harris was the serial killer from the get go it is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so br br and the grandest problem of all why don t ann and harris get together they fall for each other they have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener s shack come home to find out about buddy s tragic end and then br br nothing br br they meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and i couldn t help but wondering why why the movie doesn t let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so i had a hard time feeling sorry for them br br the part of the story in the present is fairly boring the cliché good daughter and the cliché bad daughter nina changes over the course of the movie but i am not sure why i m not sure what convinces her to change her life there is a touching scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old ann dreaming she s chasing a butterfly it is really lame and embarrassing br br there are no mistakes ann advises at us the statement doesn t ring true with the story and it doesn t ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they hadn t wasted the talent of such good actors 
there are some nice shots in this film it catches some of the landscapes with such a beautiful light in fact the cinematography is probably it s best asset br br but it s basically more of a made for tv movie and although it has a lot of twists and turns in the plot which keeps it quite interesting viewing there are no subtitles and key plot developments are unveiled in spanish so non spanish speakers will be left a little lost br br i had it as a xmas gift as it s a family trait to work through the films of a actor we find talented and matthew mconaughey was just awesome in a time to kill and the the newton boys so i expressed i wanted to see more of his work br br however although it says on the dvd box it is a matthew mconaughey film and uses this as a marketing ploy he has a few lines and is on screen for not very minutes at the end of the film he is basically an extra and he doesn t exactly light up the screen while he is on so die hard fans really not worth it from that point of view br br the films star though patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye and his character is just so nice and kind and caring a true saint of a guy he d be well written into a rom com br br so for true mcconaughey acting brilliance of the ones i ve seen i d recommend a time to kill  the newton boys frailty how to lose a guy in 10 days edtv and amistad and avoid too larger than life and angels in the outfield unless you feel like a kids film or have kids around as neither of these are indicative of his talent but are quite amusing films for children again mm is really nothing more that a supporting artist with just a few if any lines br br as for scorpion springit s not a bad film but it also isn t screen stealing either

despite its stereotypes virtually no name cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright much better than i expected it to be i was skeptical at first the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me but in the end i thought the film handled the concept well br br the cast was quite good and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously i couldn t help thinking though that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis look a like maybe it s just her face or the make up hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time br br while it s not a must see or a great film by any standard fatal error is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end 
dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result violent sexy milligan at his most home made little better than a home movie this is a trip into depravity 1960 s style notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome playing now more as quaint the film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around 
that s what my friend brian said about this movie after about an hour of it he wasn t able to keep from dozing off i had been ranting about how execrable it was and finally i relented and played it having run out of adjectives for boring br br imagine if you will the pinnacle of hack work something so uninspired so impossibly dreadful that all you want to do after viewing it is sit alone in the dark and not speak to anybody some people labor under the illusion that this movie is watchable it is not not under any form of narcotic or brain damage i would only recommend this to someone in order to help them understand how truly unbearable it is don t believe me gather round br br granted as a nation we in america don t always portray middle eastern peoples in a tasteful manner but how about a kid in a sheik outfit bowing in salaam fashion to a stack of castrol motor oil bottles you ll find that here get it the arab worships oil i couldn t believe what i was seeing having the kid fly planes into a skyscraper would ve been more appropriate who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke it s not even close to cleverly offensive it just sucks and makes you want to punch whomever got paid to write that bit in the face br br in the middle of the film a five man singing group called the landmines takes the stage at an officers ball okay are you ready the joke is they sing terribly and off key why did i write that in caps also because the joke is pound pound pounded into your head with a marathon of horrendous sight gags they start off mediocre enough glasses cracking punch tumblers shattering then there is i am 100 serious a two frame stop motion sequence of a woman s shoes coming off you read that correctly the music was so bad in one frame the woman s feet have shoes on in the very next the shoes are off get it because the music was so bad her shoes came off what the f br br then there is an endless montage of stock footage to drive home the point that the singing is bad if any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell i would be astonished this movie is honestly like a practical joke to see how fast people would bolt out the doors robert downey sr directs comedy the way his son commands respect by staying drug free badly other things to watch out for br br 1 the popular music shoehorned in wherever possible every time liceman appears a really inappropriate iggy pop song plays plus all the actors do their best to act like it got really chilly for some reason br br 2 barbara bach s criminally awful accent she sounds like she s trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around on her tongue there is no nudity and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe from a glimpse of her cleavage like they re in a community school acting class and they ve been directed to act like aroused retarded people br br 3 liceman feeds his revolting dog a condom remember when this movie came out throwing in abortion and condom was seen as edgy br br 4 tom poston plays a mincing boy hungry pedophile back when hollywood thought pedophile and homosexual were one in the same flat out embarrassing br br 5 watch the ending nothing is wrong with your vcr that is actually the ending tell me that doesn t make you want to explode everyone who s ever made any movie ever br br watch this at your own risk up the academy has been known to actually make other movies like the jerk or blazing saddles less funny simply by placing the videotape near them 
if you ve ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says jesus is the answer what s the question then perhaps you should thank god if you ve never met a lacanian slavoj zizek the most evangelical of lacanians would surely exchange the word jesus in that statement for lacan hegel br br zizek s star burns brightly at the moment no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption so it seems impressive when someone anyone comes along and says hang on films may say something about ourselves br br the ideas zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so for example zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego superego and id this is simply what they are in zizek s output culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology people may object that he certainly has something to say but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to god s will br br what s wrong with taking examples from films or anywhere to illustrate theory well nothing at all as zizek seems to believe they may even serve as a proof however it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context without context you can say and prove anything you want for zizek lacan is the answer so he goes and makes an example of it everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out to serve this ideology for instance zizek s exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop but in the context of the film this is not a voyeur s fantasy position at all stewart has been deliberately led there by novak this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizek s two hour and a half cinematic sermon br br his analysis of the baby wants to f  scene in blue velvet is laughable touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific truth of feminine jouissance zizek says that isabella rossilini s character not only demands her degradation but is unconsciously in charge of the situation this is an example of her jouissance well  possibly but sorry to be prosaic where is the evidence for this in the film she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan but this may be due to any number of things isn t that the point of so called feminine jouissance according to lacan feminine jouissance unlike phallic jouissance cannot be articulated it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language if this is right then no example can be made of it it also means that the entire concept is non sensical and entirely mystical it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek there s feminine jouissance for you why is this feminine jouissance because i say so br br what example can really be garnered from these films only zizek s psychology why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films even to the point that when in a boat on botega bay he says he wants to f rod steiger too is this not the wish fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films as the saying goes freud would have a field day with the pervert s guide to the cinema but with zizek himself nobody else br br zizek s theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely as to be almost useless how the rest of us desire for as any psychoanalyst knows how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated and cannot be easily universalised if at all zizek s love of making everything an example of lacan s answer bears this out how do we desire like this this is how i do it problem is in zizek s desire everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire but zizek is a leninist and they certainly don t like letting the subject speak for itself br br the pervert s guide to the cinema is a summation zizek s love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis what he is trying to discover because the terms of his exploration and therefore his ethics in doing so are never put into question br br zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing he s a kind of henry ford of cultural theory mass production and any colour as long as it s black he is perfect for today s highly consumerist society supposedly critical while giving people the same c ap over and over and pretending that it is something different this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems which capitalism always claims to provide rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all which is kind of like being brain dead for me zizek s third matrix pill is a suicide capsule br br ps i loved zizek s solemn remark presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity that music in films can greatly affect people s sympathies did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws 
i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released many reviewers out there aren t old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multi layered supernatural story on the screen salem s lot had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini series directed by tobe hooper and was badly handled turning the major villain of the book into a chiller theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise fans hoped that a director of kubrick s stature would succeed where hooper had failed it didn t happen br br sure this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments it s all downhill jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson he s always crazy and didn t bring anything to his role here i don t care that many reviewers here think he s all that in this clinker the here s johnny bit notwithstanding he s just awful in this movie so is everyone else for that matter scatman crothers character dick halloran was essential to the plot of the book yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest shock sequences ever put on film i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick those that stayed that is many left king s books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters and often metaphysically kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don t really care what happens to whom br br this movie still stinks and why so many think it s a horror masterpiece is beyond me 
i must admit i burst out laughing when i saw one reviewer compare this to lotr well yes if you exclude the dwarfs the cast of thousands the great special effects the big battles the strong characterization the decent plot the good acting the classy direction and everything else which leaves you with the walking and boy does this film do walking if mr piano had his way this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the wisconsin countryside but every 40 minutes or so these pesky martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble you ve never seen so much walking in a movie if this really had a 20m budget most of it must have gone on mr piano s shoes because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does which explains why there s no money left for decent effects a decent video camera or proper actors honestly it s like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes even on fast forward this is a looonnnggg walk br br as for the sci fi stuff i think it was a mistake to put martians in the film they only get in the way of the walking which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story br br i wonder how much mr piano charges to walk dogs 
wow br br i just was given this film from a friend of mine who bought it for 1 98 at walmart and he felt that he got taken it is beyond boring most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen the acting is somewhat improvised almost as if they didn t have a script the martians are cgi which look like they were done by a novice or a fan produced movie i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is br br example in one of the scenes the martians are torturing a local female captive she goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a cgi copy of that woman the change is totally noticeable and when she is killed you can see that it is a computer figure looking like something from a game back in 1990 br br if at all possible avoid this movie like the plague you can download two trailers from their site and see how god awful it really is 
i cannot stay indifferent to lars van trier s films i consider breaking the waves nothing less than a masterpiece i loved dancer in the night i admired the idea in dogville but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical less cinema europa which i see only now was a famous film at its time succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie but did not survive well the time in my opinion it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste br br the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today more such was novel and courageous two decades ago yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task br br the film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock especially his early films set in the pre war europe with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the re birth of germany after war of its might of its obsession with order and regulation of punctuality and civility the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys the principal character a young american of german origin coming to post war europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of self destruction with love doubtfully mixed with treason br br it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case the actions of the characters especially of leopold kessler played by jean marc barr seem confused and lack credibility the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcock like but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s the usage of color over the black and white film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means but he is too demonstrative he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is he really is great as he will show in some of his later films but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone 
as an altman fan i d sought out this movie for years thinking that with such a great cast it would have to be at least marginally brilliant br br big mistake br br this is one of altman s big cast mishmashes thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room it doesn t br br as maltin points out this turkey is notable only for the debut performance of alfre woodard who outshines the vets all around her but other than that avoid at all costs 
poorly written conspiracy drama mystery about the possibility that aids was introduced to the public by the government wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find despite the cinematography itself being commendable the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey grade d 
as a single woman over 40 i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40 not to mention every other woman of any age it was a sad pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick and it failed miserably andy mcdowell isn t much of an actress to begin with but given the non existent plot in this she didn t have a chance there was no character development no reason to feel sympathy empathy for any of the characters and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable and then there s the obligatory male fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try please br br not only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental i also want those 112 minutes of my life back what a ripoff 
not only is it a disgustingly made low budget bad acted movie but the plot itself is just stupid br br a mystic man that eats women br br ridiculous if you ve got nothing better to do you should watch this yeah right 
this movie was so unrelentingly bad i could hardly believe i was watching it the directing editing production and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don t know all that much about movies there was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense big emotional moments and climaxes and character relationships come completely out of no where and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film the characters are sadly underdeveloped making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them the acting surprisingly is not entirely bad but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances the film plays like a particularly bad t v western epic and sadly diminishes the fascinating story that it attempts to tell i have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to australians because of the subject matter that s all very well but just because ned kelly is an important australian historical icon doesn t make the movie good no one is saying that the subject matter isn t good just the quality of the movie itself pearl harbor was about a very important historical event to americans but that doesn t mean i m going to defend the movie and say it was good because it was still bad a failure all around though heath and orlando are lovely to look at 
this movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie the main character was decently done and i felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory however everything else sucks the director emmanuel is quite incompetent at film making he uses some of the most idiotic shots ever br br  a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film i don t know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he wasn t it was stupid random shots of the trailer the main character lived in random buildings random pan shots of buildings random cat which walks away wtf and clouds lots of gloomy dark clouds br br  he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot ex guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him instead of just one shot he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really edgy and hip and smart stupid br br the acting is horrible but it s what makes the movie so funny and the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time and some of the deaths could have been better you expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope a simple corncob in the ear the love interest was hot voluptuous which is why this movie gets a 2 
valentine is a horrible movie this is what i thought of it br br acting very bad katherine heigl can not act the other s weren t much better br br story the story was okay but it could have been more developed this movie had the potential to be a great movie but it failed br br music yes some of the music was pretty cool br br originality not very original the name paige prescott recognize prescott br br bottom line don t see valentine it s a really stupid movie br br 1 10 br br 
there s tons of good looking women in this flick but alas this movie is nudity free grrrrrrrrrr strike one br br ahem one story in this film takes place in 1971 then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage hello continuity anyone br br as you might know this movie was released in stereoscopic 3d and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen i m not sure if someone botched the job on this but there was no 3d just double vision blurs i didn t have the same problem with this company s other 3d movies hunting season and camp blood sure the 3d in those ones sucked too but with them i could see a semblance of 3d effect br br this thing is a big ball of nothing br br and whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear eating dame yum i d like to see more of her in movies as well looks like janet margolin at a young age purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr br br 
oh brother after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all i can think of is that old peggy lee song br br is that all there is  i was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the u s i was too young to get in the theater then a screening at a local film museum beckoned finally i could see this film except now i was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it br br the only reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its u s release millions of people flocked to this stinker thinking they were going to see a sex film instead they got lots of closeups of gnarly repulsive swedes on street interviews in bland shopping malls asinie political pretension and feeble who cares simulated sex scenes with saggy pale actors br br cultural icon holy grail historic artifact whatever this thing was shred it burn it then stuff the ashes in a lead box br br elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings but if it weren t for the censorship scandal it would have been ignored then forgotten br br instead the i am blank blank rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that naughty sex film that revolutionized the film industry  br br yeesh avoid like the plague or if you must see it rent the video and fast forward to the dirty parts just to get it over with br br 
okay first of all i didn t sit down to watch the premier of a star trek series to see a cowboy flying around in space this is how a normal enterprise episode works br br 1 archer finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship br br 2 he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged br br in all of the episodes i have seen all of the problems are happening because of archer s stupid mistakes oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing archer and t pol kissing   i was planning to watch that episode but after that i totally gave up on enterprise and turned to tv right off come on  this is star trek    br br also what was with the banana slug in one episode hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason okay fine little dumb to bring you pet slug in space but whatever okay that was what i thought until they left it on a desert planet a banana slug cannot leave in a desert   how dumb are these writers br br any ways just saying if enterprise is on don t watch it  
i saw the 7 5 imdb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented she said she had seen it before it s funny and sad i cried the first time i saw it she gushed maybe compared to other bollywood movies this deserves a 7 5 out of 10 but in comparison to all the other movies i have seen in my lifetime this deserves no more than a 3 any movie where i can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me the characters are unbelievable how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived it is over dramatic and the songs aren t all that great my biggest problem with bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety all the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song i think i understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary if a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just isn t meaningful just a bit embarrassing br br  spoiler br br generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told too many plot holes to count at first the movie was amusing and cute in the way bollywood movies are to people who don t watch them that avidly but it just got tedious it takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the end br br  spoiler over perhaps it had a very little more depth than other bollywood movies that i have seen but not much at all i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny i didn t shed a single tear nor did i feel like it rather i was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending i don t recommend this movie if you want to watch something good i recommend it if you want to watch a bollywood movie that is kind of sad 
normally when i write a review for a movie online it is for one of three reasons either i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent i feel that the public s perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as this is one of the best films of all time does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good which should be the point of the review in the first place with that being said war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried incompetent attempt at a money grab piggy backing its loathsome carcass on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger now with most of the insults out of the way allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i br br judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular check this is not a big deal for me as i find a large budget and an over reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score check again what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien battle scenes br br now as per imdb s policy any spoilers must be announced in advance no matter how small so here is fair warning the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot seriously it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth but by the end of the first ten minutes the combination of shaky camera work spliced scenes and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer however the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going the next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot they both walk back to town these walks aren t two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie in a particularly grueling scene the main character is shown looking at a pod then he is shown pacing and panting then he looks at the pod then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town then comes in to town and walks into a building then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod i apologize for the extreme run on sentence but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film characters speak way too long about mundane things they walk a lot they send other people to walk the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed but for no dramatic effect simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere the editing is mind bogglingly bad people actions make little sense for instance when the professor goes to a farmer s house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town the farmer stutters and paces around when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion i have seen better high school video productions finally the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage however it is so awful in technical aspects and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad avoid this film at all costs 
can i please say first of all that i felt so strongly about this movie that i signed up to imdb specifically to review it and my review this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen br br the synopsis of the movie sounded interesting nazis occult time travel etc but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together remember the episode of south park that featured manatees writing family guy using idea balls did these manatees also write unholy its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas but had no idea how to link them all together and then to make things make even less sense included a donnie darko esquire time travel theme to the ending messing up the chronology br br i could tell from early on that this was a bad movie special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to dvd the acting wasn t great but in fairness i ve seen worse i will praise the nazi paintings they were creepy but the evil nazi butcher guy was just comic br br i don t have a vendetta against this movie or anything but to be honest i m not even into the horror genre but this movie cannot be described as a thriller or a drama if this story had been well told this would have been a good movie but it has been over hyped waaaaay over hyped 
i m not a huge star trek fan but i was looking forward to this i was intrigued by the pre hype descriptions of the enterprise its cramped submarine styling and rough edged technology compared to the treks we are used to br br i didn t see anything all that interesting in this pilot i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing br br i will admit that i did like some of the character development the depictions of the humans as an adolescent species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining br br and that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack br br but i don t think i m going to get hooked on this series br br 3 10
i have been known to fall asleep during films but this is usually due to a combination of things including really tired being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot however on this occasion i fell asleep because the film was rubbish the plot development was constant constantly slow and boring things seemed to happen but with no explanation of what was causing them or why i admit i may have missed part of the film but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else i cant recommend this film at all 
 br br paul verhoeven finally bombed out on this one he became a joke on himself once again we have a film which includes sex and violence immorality leering at women and lots of attitiude talk between the characters and dollying pans br br its all for nothing because their is no action at all in this film it fudges all its set pieces all the actors give the kind of performances form a verhoeven film in other words rampant over acting on almost every level starship troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world the characters inhabited in this scientists are acting the same way sorry paul but soldiers and scientist are not really made of the same mindset br br one major flaw in the plot was that after escaping for that one night to do evil things kevin bacons character then returns back to the science lab where we have already spent more then enough time watching these animated manniquens walk and talk why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world how could they possibly track him if he could be anywhere at all think os all the different things that could have been done with this concept both in terms of story and characterisation then look at what this film does and you really how badly done and concieved the whole project really was br br more insulting is the doco on the dvd where everyone is claiming that verhoeven is some kind of mad genius well one out of two isnt that bad br br this film has nothing of note in it just like the title says br br hollow

those of you who like me were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn the fear will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel it sort of follows a similar plot but it is impossible to connect to the original with the exception of the presence of morty the mannequin monster made of wood here is a brief overview br br twenty years after mike hawthorne witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life mike is still suffering from the fear of that day in hopes of ridding his fear mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents home his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears and then present the fears to the mannequin morty according to an indian friend this process is supposed to magically take away one s fear what mike doesn t know is that morty is possessed with his father s spirit and begins killing off the friends or is it really mike himself doing the killings who cares br br a have a few troubles with this film the first lies with morty i thought the original made morty look rather convincing this time it is painfully obvious morty is a man in a fake looking suit this can especially be seen in early scenes where morty is still supposed to be inanimate but if you watch closely you can see him blinking another trouble is that most of the characters don t try hard enough some of them do namely betsy palmer of friday the 13th fame who was excellent in this film but most of them don t make the effort or weren t given the chance finally there are the killings the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing actually when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie when the second half of the movie arrives and the killings really start everything falls to pieces deaths are either uncreative unseen or foreseen one character dies in the end and no one including the viewer even notices while more characterization was needed in the beginning half it wasn t too bad the second half was i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didn t know how to shoot the violent scenes so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian a silly ending doesn t help either thus unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin you should probably skip the fear 2 halloween night zanatos score 4 out of 10 
this film is notable for three reasons br br first apparently capitalizing on the success of the two superman serials this low budget feature was made and released to theaters marking george reeves and phyllis coates initial appearances as clark kent superman and lois lane part of the opening is re used in the series outside the town of silby a six mile deep oil well penetrates the hollow earth allowing the mole men to come to the surface forget about the other holes br br second unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties the hero plays a dominant force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes no mild mannered reporter here clark kent knowledgeable and self assertive grabs control of the situation throughout even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a mole man as superman he is gentler than clark towards the feisty lois but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as nazi storm troopers br br third you will notice that the transition from the fleisher like cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the live action flying in the adventures of superman had not yet been made

this movie isn t very good it s boring and not much blood for a horror film the plot just trods along with not much happening and i think the female vampire was so stupid she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes but whenever she has one of them pinned she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn t bite them no wonder this went straight to cable br br final verdict not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie you re a sucker if you waste your time on this 
i saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening and i must say i was extremely disappointed and i have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast claire danes in the lead role depending on what you think about danes she was either horribly miscast or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 razzie for worst actress i think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her instead she is completely unlikeable the other great actresses do an ok job but certainly don t light up the screen out of all the great actresses in this movie i d say the one who did the best job was natasha richardson streep is barely in the picture and only appears near the very end br br horrible screenplay as well it comes off more as them reading lines than truly being in character 
this movie had the potential to be far more than it was but it not only fails to deliver it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time br br john cusack is even flatter than he was in midnight of the garden of good and evil the difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent which he noticeably loses several times each scene br br al pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck he s good as usual but hardly standout br br supporting cast throw in female romantic interest which added little if anything to the story speaking of the story a convoluted who really cares tale where cusack is the self righteous mayor s boy who just has to search for the right thing to be done br br people don t act this way cusack s character loses all credibility at the end of which without revealing it is preach and nauseous the final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound it s also completely inaccurate but i won t get into law br br this is a bad by the numbers movie it seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it s really a preachy proselytizing self righteous film for the last hour better off with mindless crap than this pile of junk 
i read somewhere that when kay francis refused to take a cut in pay warner bros retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract br br she decided to take the money but her career suffered accordingly br br that might explain what she was doing in comet over broadway  ludicrous is the word that others have used for the plot of this film and that s right on target the murder trial her seedy vaudeville career her success in london her final scene with her daughter no part logically leads to the next part br br also the sets and costumes looked like b movie stuff and her hair turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month watch any other one and you ll be doing yourself a favor 
robert wagner is the evil boss of digicron a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people br br so you re saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people that may be medically possible but not possible from my system br br i m having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it it may take some time br br but it s not going after software it s killing people br br watch out for the i m into virology love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard
i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made i too had to fast forward through most of this movie michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someone the picture quality is grainy all the way through and what little plot there is is just plain stupid i give this movie a 1 out of 10 if i could give it a lower score i would don t waste your time on this movie or you ll regret it 
 plan b is strictly by the numbers fare except for one thing i surprisingly found it to be rather insulting br br jon cryer is the star of this film and plays his usual smarmy egotistical snotty character that was actually endearing in pretty in pink and has not been amusing ever since grating doesn t even begin to describe his performance ricky is a muscular blonde struggling actor who is only worried about his hair and getting laid talk about a stock character ugh at least the other three characters are somewhat engaging lisa darr and lance guest play a grounded optimistic caring couple who are struggling to conceive since they are not whiny drama queens however their roles are apparently considered boring and they aren t given enough screen time sara mornell rounds out the cast by playing gina your usual nice and good looking young woman who just can t seem to find the right partner in love i ve seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation br br what startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes they introduced a russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked he was portrayed as being wild ignorant and amazingly shallow they were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays gina decides to be gay for a while since she isn t having any luck with guys honestly that wasn t that bad except they really went overboard when gina brought a lesbian to a christmas party her friends were throwing her lesbian date had very short hair she also got quite upset when gina had the nerve to put on lipstick finally her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when gina expresses her disappointment of course we all know how gay people can t stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years right br br this film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but cryer s unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema 2 10
eh not a particular good slasher flick so so acting effects decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack br br there are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes apart from that there s a lot of characters wandering around not realizing what s going on or chasing after red herrings more killing of time than of people there are other deaths and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer not partial to any one implement the killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well the identity isn t revealed towards the end and motive is pretty thin and we really don t care br br supposedly the movie takes place around christmas but this isn t a major factor one scene gets lit by christmas lights that s about it br br the movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time at least on the videotape i watched some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes the ending should have been stronger than it was we think we realize what happened although there s a chance something else did 
i won t say this movie was bad but it wasn t good either i expected something good but i guess hum aapke hain kaun was much better than this this was completely old fashioned at every stage of this movie i hoped for some twist and what do i get the girl gets burned and wins her aunt s love br br despite of being engaged they have to take permission for every little move they make they are so darn shy even after so many meetings i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that all she did was crib madly br br hey we have kids too but we don t watch them and have tears in our eyes always this movie is a dream happy family one cruel woman good in laws and a man who loves her to death in hahk anupam kher was the poor bride s father and now it s vice versa and i somehow knew that mohnish behl would be in this movie anyway i believe i wasted my time i give it a 2 10 
paul armstrong is a liberal scottish born professor of law at harvard known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver an eleven year old white girl earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row hoping to persuade him to confess to joanie s murder thereby saving earl from the electric chair br br at first all goes well sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer warning major plot twist ahead and so it proves the anticipated twist soon materialises earl it transpires is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted and probably of several others as well but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom sullivan will confess to joanie s murder if earl will murder his parents armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved earl has a grudge against armstrong s wife herself a lawyer who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape br br just cause is an example of the auto cannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others the first half owes an obvious debt to films like intruder in the dust and to kill a mockingbird about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black whereas in earlier films he would have been white the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costa gavras s music box although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end the finale in which a lawyer his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of cape fear which also take place in the swamplands of the american south ed harris characterisation of sullivan as a bible quoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niro s character in the scorsese version of cape fear made four years before just cause br br br br the trouble with this style of film making by numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts and just cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the innocent young man of the early scenes but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better but neither is good enough to save the film  br br there is another problem with just cause the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie anti death penalty anti racist and critical of heavy handed policing the second half looks more like the work of a die hard reactionary preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the effect of reversing its political stance or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency 4 10
this was an incredibly stupid movie it was possibly the worst movie i ve ever had the displeasure of sitting through i cannot fathom how it ranks a rating of 5 or 6   
this is not michael madsen s fault he was hardly in it this movie was just awful if you want to laugh and be bored go ahead and watch this movie words cannot describe how idiotic it is sorry michael the cinematography was dark all the other actors are unknowns when watching it it feels like a soft porn but with no nudity or heated scenes this movie had sexual overtones since it is about a underground s m killer the acting was bad except michael madsen s parts he looked like he wanted to laugh i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie it is something i would not be proud of it is not even a b movie for cable it is more like a f and it should never be shown ever 
6 10 acting not great but some good acting br br 4 10 director makes some stupid decisions for this film br br 2 10 writer story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws br br 4 10 overall score for this movie br br don t waste your time with this film it s not worth it i gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens storywise not in good way because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes it s always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there s too many tracks in this one in the first hour there is almost 50 50 dialogs and musics
even though there s a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from this succubus is often named as the best jess franco film heck even the legendary filmmaker fritz lang counts succubus among his personal favorites so maybe it s me but i thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie the opening is great though and shows janine reynaud performing an sm act on stage it s all downhill from here unfortunately reynaud s character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score this could have been his greatest film indeed if it wasn t for the lame and uninteresting story it s supposed to be psychedelic but i d say sophomoric is a better term to describe what s shown here half of the time you don t have a clue what s going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages this most certainly isn t franco s best film according to me i wouldn t even recommend it to die hard exploitation fans if you re looking for more superior jess franco film try to get your hands on las vampiras the awful dr orloff or female vampire 
first of all jon bon jovi doesn t seem to be in place in a vampire movie together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable if you keep that in mind and you re a total vampire movie fan you can have some fun with a few of the scenes don t expect any tarantino style chapters here and neither an anne rice storyline 
the major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of macbeth hearing david lansbury s soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous tomorrow tomorrow and tomorrow speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role i kept believing therefore that he didn t get the part because he was a lousy actor not because a bigger name was available then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done that they settle for less this appears to be such an example

an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe they ve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that they ve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but it s simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script i suppose there weren t enough naked people in the factual version it s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist s life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they d favored the rest of the film with same brevity 
creep your journey terminates here some very graphic scenes and well yeah that s about all for this film br br no real plot no storyline no likable characters well characters isn t correct considering you don t have a clue who anyone really is i mean they are being chased by some weird looking thing in the sewers that s quite scary i guess but do i really care no i don t why don t i because i don t have a clue who these people are and i don t know if i should want them to live or die it s one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you which it rarely does br br this film lacks any meaning any purpose it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up it jumps right into the action basically some women and her friends get locked in the london underground get chased by a weird creature then they eventually escape from it br br creep has its moments which make you jump the art is good the location is excellent and the sounds are ok but that isn t what makes a decent horror film so unfortunately all that goes to waste br br it s nothing new another predictable modern horror where kate consistently does the stupid hey i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation but oooh no i m going to do the total opposite because i m a dumb blond thing i wish they wouldn t do that it s done so many times it s boring and gets predictable in fact i m pretty annoyed the silly woman didn t get stabbed by the erm grey alien looking creature br br your journey terminates here is the films tag line well creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film if you ve had a few beers got a couple of mates back at yours then sure watch it by all means but if you want something original and clever avoid 
what the   is this this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you can t set your expectations for an 80 s slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i baught this film for 0 89 and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks br br who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldn t possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn t care they didn t try to create a tiny bit of tension the director also made the kindred wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had eliza dushku this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga yeah that s right the melrose place chick her very memorable character dies about 15 min after the opening credits she s the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares the rest of the actors they don t deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting you re hoping they die a quick and painful death and not only their characters br br my humble opinion 0 10
ever notice how in his later movies burt reynolds laugh sounds like screeching brakes br br must have been hanging out with hal needham too much br br and from the looks of stroker ace way too much br br can you believe this was based on a book neither could i but it was and probably not a best seller i ll wager br br burt s another good old boy in the nascar circuit who hitches up with beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team anderson provides what love interest there is and nabors does his umpteenth gomer pyle impression as faithful mechanic best friend lugs br br a lot of people here are friends of burt s or hal s others must have needed the work and even real nascar drivers get in on the act and look to have more talent than those with sag cards br br as far as laughs go bubba smith gets them as beatty s chauffeur and petersen in full elvira mode gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know lugs real well real well br br it s a shame that burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like stroker ace where it didn t matter whether he bothered to act or not they didn t bother to write a character for him why bother to act br br two stars mostly for petersen and for the out takes at the end now they re funny 
a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and that s about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life melissa virus also made it s debut in e mail inboxes across the world 
i think it was an overrated pg 13 crap at least brittany snow s performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too the deaths were stupid boring and completely unoriginals the movie was very boring too and very overrated it wasn t suspenseful at all i almost fall asleep its another bad pg 13 remake its really a dreadful movie imo the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring the movie is pretty slow too overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake well thats just my opinion i gave it a 2 10 
ned akelly is such an important story to australians but this movie is awful it s an australian story yet it seems like it was set in america also ned was an australian yet he has an irish accent it is the worst film i have seen in a long time
if the crew behind zombie chronicles ever read this here s some advice guys br br 1 in a twist ending type movie it s not a good idea to insert close ups of every death in the movie in the opening credits that tends to spoil the twists y know br br 2 i know you produced this on a shoestring and to be fair you worked miracles with your budget but please hire people who can actually act or at least walk talk and gesture at the same time joe haggerty i m looking at you br br 3 if you re going to set a part of your movie in the past only do this if you have the props and costumes of the time br br 4 twist endings are supposed to be a surprise sure we don t want twists that make no sense but signposting the reveal as soon as you introduce a character that s not a great idea br br kudos to the guys for trying but in all honesty i d rather they hadn t br br only for zombie completists 
the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous the plot is awful but on the plus side the acting is pretty good with a few good shouts and rants sharon stone is ok this time not even half as good as the original mind you the murders aren t as gory as the first one either which is a shame its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake the script is weak most of the time but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr glass and washburn are highlights the plot twists a few times but the ending is awful the tension is always constant with a huge dollop of oh my god the chase sequences are brilliantly directed and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise rush felt film sharon stone is a bit old for this too the bits where we see her breasts were in the first one delights this time around they are too horrid to describe the films its self is rather average but it is worth a go mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz with the opening sequence being a highlight not to be critical but if you liked the first one leave this one don t ruin the run you ll be glad you left this stone unturned 
this has to be the worst piece of garbage i ve seen in a while br br heath ledger is a heartthrob he looked deformed i wish i d known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him br br orlando bloom is a heartthrob with the scraggly beard and deer in the headlights look about him i can t say i agree br br rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn t wait to get off the set br br i m supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers this is a far cry from butch cassidy which actually was an entertaining film this was trite cliche ridden and boring we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better it didn t br br the last 10 15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel and women and children are dying because of their presence that s not funny but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail i kept waiting for them to say i ll bite yer leg off we were howling with laughter as were several other warped members of the audience when we left pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was br br i may not have paid cash to see this disaster but it certainly wasn t free it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back 
this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film down br br i feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are believable br br who ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick flashy edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as annoying br br i wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like i d wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money 
sure i like short cartoons but i didn t like this one naturally kids would love it but then again i m not a kid anymore br br i will not tell you anything about the story for the simple reason there is no story how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar well i guess it s because people in the 30 s were more happy with not much than now in the present where we live everything must happen fast look at the movies nowadays and you will come to the same conclusion we live in a society that doesn t allow men to be slow that s really a shame i wish i lived in the 30 s because it seems so peaceful but every time has got its ups and downs i guess br br to conclude if you like music you ll have to see this cartoon otherwise don t spill your time on it 
one of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne zuniga her character dies fairly early on and the rest of the film is totally forgettable br br during their christmas break a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture a crazy killer however throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways br br exploiting every stalk n slash cliché in the book director jeffrey obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile the majority of the deaths are brief and not that gory the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor br br at the last minute the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending but this really is one for slasher completists only 
i gave this film 2 stars only because dominic monaghan actually put effort through in his acting everything else about this film is extremely amateur everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films as dominic monaghan is a very credible actor placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful whomever the actor was that played jack s best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera i didn t expect much from such a small film but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings don t waste your time or money on this film you will be sorely disappointed 
the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i ve put the spoiler warning up because i m unsure if i m giving anything away the audience first sees some man in jack the ripper garb murder an old man in an alley a hundred years ago then we re up to modern day and a young australian couple is looking for a house we re given an unbelievably long tour of this house and the husband sees a figure in an old mirror some 105 year old woman lived there there are also large iron panels covering a wall in the den an old fashioned straight razor falls out when they re renovating and the husband keeps it i guess he becomes possessed by the razor because he starts having weird dreams oh yeah the couple is unable to have a baby because the husband is firing blanks br br some mold seems to be climbing up the wall after the couple removes the iron panels and the mold has the shape of a person late in the story there is a plot about a large cache of money the husband murders the body guard a co worker and steals the money his wife is suddenly pregnant br br what the hell is going on who knows nothing is explained was the 105 year old woman the child of the serial killer the baby sister why were iron panels put on the wall how would that keep the serial killer contained in the cellar was he locked down there by his family starved to death or just concealed who is mr hobbs and why is he so desperate to get the iron panels he s never seen again why was the serial killer killing people we only see the one old man murdered was there a pattern or motive or something why does the wife suddenly become pregnant is it the demon spawn of the serial killer has he managed to infiltrate the husband s semen and why if the husband was able to subdue and murder a huge burly security guard is he unable to overpower his wife and just how powerful is the voltage system in australia that it would knock him across the room simply cutting a light wire and why does the wife stay in the house is she now possessed by the serial killer is the baby going to be the killer reincarnated br br this movie was such a frustrating experience i wanted to call my pbs station and ask for my money back the only enjoyable aspect of this story was seeing the husband running around in just his boxer shorts for a lot of the time but even that couldn t redeem this muddled incoherent mess 
this is a terrible movie terrible script bad direction and nonsensical ending also bad performances except from clancy brown who is criminally underused here and michael pollard watching this movie was purgatory you do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line br br the movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn t every possibly have been related the part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role you can see the plot points a mile away the actions of the female lead and that of her brother the cop also make no sense so a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script wise 
okay enjoy is a pretty relative term but flexibility is in order when you re dealing with a filmmaker of james glickenhaus calibre br br mcbain is truly one of the most ridiculous over the top action films i ve ever seen without the nasty edge of the exterminator other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film s heroic middle aged commandos but how about making a film in the philippines that is set in colombia all the extras are filipino in fact the only character who looks remotely hispanic is good ol victor argo as the much reviled el presidente oh yes we also have maria conchita alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader there are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of american imperialism 
blazing saddles it s a fight between two estranged brothers both of whom can ignite fires mentally they square off over childhood differences with dippy love interest debra winger caught in the middle director glenn gordon caron smothers the darkly textured comedy in vince gilligan s screenplay with a presentation so slick the movie resembles an entry from an over enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million dollar grant it has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities these aren t even characters they re plot functions barely released to theaters the film is a disaster although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good winger is the only stand out in a cast which looks truly perplexed 1 2 from  
the episodic version of robert heinlein s starship troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace following johnny rico leaving his parents the girl he lusts for and joining the mobile infantry the aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film instead being squid like monsters that shoot lasers out of their mouths br br throughout watching this version i was continually amazed at just how fruity they ve managed to make the whole thing the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits and the aching prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors with 80s synth pop sometimes arriving during the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes in terms of construction it owes a debt to top gun sharing much in terms of pacing and content 
this is without a doubt the most offensive chick flick i have seen in years if not ever the writing characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster we were subjected to the following themes having a baby will solve all of your problems performer types are miserable messes musicians can t be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle what a waste of a talented cast some great looking sets costumes when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life she ll end up shudder alone i felt queasy i can t believe this movie made it to theatrical release it s the sort of fare one expects from those women s cable channels that i always pass right by when channel surfing i am female and over 35 so i should be part of this film s target audience but boy does evening miss its target 
in director sooraj barjatya s vivah 20 something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure small town girl his father has selected for him to marry drawn to her innocence and simplicity shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he s met her at her home in madhupur and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor the marriage is fixed for six months later and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young budding love their geographical distance notwithstanding but amrita who s been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents death is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage and then it s up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain barjatya s new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise but sadly the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated even more far fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps and the problem is clear you just can t relate to such squeaky clean characters who don t have one bad bone in their bodies there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films and timing is one such important factor twenty five years ago perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp perhaps the film s only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish you can make out right away that the filmmaker s intention is not to deceive judging both by barjatya s previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world he believes in his good as gold characters he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps but alas he s unable to translate his vision to the screen it s difficult to overlook how one dimensional his protagonists are shahid and amrita both virtuous and virginal i mean think about it the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film barjatya may think he s returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah those pairs had mischief and masti shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s style tunes that only further slacken the film s deadening pace but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn t work for me it s because i m not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatya s story to some perhaps vivah will give hope that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere but i m a little cynical i guess so give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya i ll even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain but save me from these dullards you know some marriages aren t made in heaven this one s vivah 
all i could think of while watching this movie was b grade slop many have spoken about it s redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole br br as far as the plot is concerned it was lacklustre unimaginative implausible and convoluted you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would br br granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far the action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there and a final gunfight towards the end nothing really to write home about br br as others have said bad movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are bad you revel in that fact this film however is a void it s nothing br br furthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way requiem for a dream trainspotting fear and loathing in las vegas and candy are just a few examples though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like go and halfbaked br br on a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from lock stock and two smokling barrels to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by loaded is vile br br overall i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie 
this crap is like watching paint dry i m so disappointed because i was so eager to see it br br there simply is no meaning to this film if it were never made no one would notice or care it s hyped up because of all the big names in it but if nobody s were in nobody would give this film any love br br seriously i was at the point where half way through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think hurry up and die already this is like the joy luck club without any of the friggin joy it s the ocean s 13 of mother daughter movies and completely anti climatic oh until it s finally over br br i m sure they ll all be nominated for oscars br br  4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk 
one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a br br script existed that made any sense was the rough cut 3 hours br br long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives br br why would anyone finance this mess i will say that tom br br wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can br br with the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given but br br characters come and go for no apparent reason continuity is br br non existent and the acting cinematography and direction are amateurish not one sleeps is an unfortunate br br choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone br br actually attempt to actually watch this film

this movie portrays ruth as a womanizing hard drinking gambling overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in babe ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film also lou gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship good bad or indifferent it should have been covered better than it was his life was more than all bad he was an american hero an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not his greatness 
oh man if you want to give your internal crow t robot a real workout this is the movie to pop into the ol vcr the potential for cut up lines in this film is just endless br br traci is a girl with a problem psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite sex parent but this girl seems to have one for her same sex one and i don t think there s a term for that it might be because her mother dana is played by rosanna arquette whose cute overbite neo flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters here dana is not only clueless to her daughter s conduct she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the olympic indulgent mother competition br br it s possible that dana misses traci s murderous streak because truth be told traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster it s only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count br br a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she s like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say i just fell off the tomato truck from guadalajara carmen is so wise to traci s scheming she might also wear a sign saying hey i m the next victim sure enough traci confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke i rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire br br in another sequence arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard under cloudy skies talking to the owner cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies talking to the owner s brother then cut to her wearing the first dress in the first location under cloudy skies but it s supposed to be later you get the picture we re talking really bad directing br br as for skin don t expect much although traci does own a nice couple of bikinis br br for those looking for a trash wallow 8 for anybody else 1 2 
william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie he left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts but he tries to keep away from his family thats where peter falk comes in playing several different roles to convince him to come home br br the story is average and they actually managed to get a former star and use him to a fairly nice degree but william russ wasn t truly a star however it appears his acting is still ok br br i found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable in fact the last 20 minutes i could almost dictate word for word before it happened a good movie should never be like that br br overall it was a sub par movie in a letter grading system it would receive a d

a friend of mine bought this film for 1 and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girls br br adam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ship s resident comedian the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea sandler s character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead he s rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sick br br perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time 
i have read the novel reaper of ben mezrich a fews years ago and last night i accidentally came to see this adaption br br although it s been years since i read the story the first time the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous very important elements which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad br br if the plot sounds interesting to you go and get the novel its much much much better br br still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ben mezrich 
firstly there are some good things about this film but it s all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that i ve seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but she s a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be and what s with that look she gives everyone perhaps it s part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book it s based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time i ll read the book to find out rather than watch this 
worst mistake of my life br br i picked this movie up at target for 5 because i figured hey it s sandler i can get some cheap laughs i was wrong completely wrong mid way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering worst plot worst script worst movie i have ever seen i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then i d stop and you know why because it felt damn good upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn and that felt better than anything else i ve ever done it took american psycho army of darkness and kill bill just to get over that crap i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life    
unlike the adventures of buckaroo banzai or big trouble in little china or conan the barbarian which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations the golden child is just plain bad br br the premise itself is not unworkable and there are some funny moments but here the eddy murphy flip attitude just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension the mystic secrets of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel br br without a feeling that anything is at stake or that the characters are faced by real danger why should we care br br who should see this film br br big fans of eddy murphy who can t help themselves br br i can t think of anyone else br br i ll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked 
you have to admire brad sykes even if you don t particularly want to a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions but keeps on doing it all the same even the half hearted praise than surrounds his camp blood films is given grudgingly and i m as guilty of this as anyone brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix a neat idea a kooky character whatever but without the funds to take it further than base level he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film coming to a multiplex near you in a parallel universe somewhere 
this is a really dumb movie it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting but it just isn t br br some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween they come to earth to kill humans but instead of killing they make people their slaves and act goofy the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space not really what they do these aren t party aliens they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip off alien who always wears his sunglasses other than the aliens the acting is terrible the writing is obviously meant for children because every character is written like a kid br br this is a dumb movie that only children will appreciate maybe br br my rating 1 2 out of  100 mins pg for mild language 
i ve gotta say i usually like horror movies that i ve never seen however this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste i m used to the gory gut wrenching types but this particular movie was lame the acting was horrible one liners were cute and the sequel to it scarecrow slayer was even worse yes probably when it first came out there was a huge rave about it and people liked it but when movies like the ring and the exorcist of emily rose come out movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish if you want a movie to just pass the time pick this one the special effects are cheesy as heck but seeing that it was a low budget movie i can kind of see where that would come in this will kind of remind you of the movie children of the corn independent movies rock  most of the time so if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs or in the sequel 2 scarecrows going at it then these movies would be for you 
why hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime but is it considerably worse why hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren t brilliant to start with much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere character or any genuine scares at all prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch but for all the wrong reasons br br it s a poorly acted massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do it s clear hollywood horror is dead even the likes of the hills have eyes and the texas chainsaw massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot prom night is virtually bloodless and i m not even going to mention how bad the plot is its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm the original br br one of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be donna keppel has survived a terrible tragedy but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style br br when the big night finally arrives donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn but while donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance an obsessed killer is on the loose and he ll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only donna br br who will survive to see graduation day and what will donna do when she s forced to confront her greatest fear scott porter jessica stroup and dana davis co star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor a plot that will probably put you off going to see this witch if you ask me is a good thing br br without much to work with mccormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations at one point a girl backs into a floor lamp and mccormick tries to pump it up into a jump scare moment desperate times really do call for desperate measures there haven t been this many shots of closets since the last ikea catalogue br br in the era of the hills my super sweet 16 and to catch a predator there probably is a freaky scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society s creepy obsession with youthful beauty this is not that movie br br my final verdict avoid at all cost nobody will like prom night it s even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack job remakes considering its absolute lack of blood or frights a night you ll be in a hurry to forget 
awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n g br br find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 br br zaphoid br br ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is br br z
jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before the bad guy plays a malkovichian character from in the line of fire the cops will do anything to find the bad guy and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf 
the worst thing about crush is not that it s acted pretty bad or that the plot is virtually non existent and it s not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better br br no the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come br br but in the end it s too little too late if you are a fan of violin music and cheap tearjerking scenes of 40 women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage then by all means don t miss it br br i myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie and as a result i had a pretty horrible time the few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it br br the verdict 4 10 guilty of wasting my time br br 
i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thin which doesn t inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it but i can t help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero  in what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didn t agree to lose the beards just to please universal br br guess i will just have to content myself with peter carey s excellent secret history of the kelly gang 4 10
this is one of the most insipid lackluster unoriginal and pointless movies ever made it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn t even try to make an appealing movie this is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of smokey and the bandit which i think is the best film of them all as for this waste of film stock burt reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie jim nabors is wasted the other actors aren t given very much to do the car races are obviously stock footage the humor is uninspired and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours stroker ace is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it 
i ve been going through the afi s list of the top 100 comedies and i must say that this is truly one of the worst not just of the 90 movies on the list i ve seen but of any movie i ve ever seen drunks are funny sometimes dudley isn t liza almost made it worthwhile but alas just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good seriously dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the afi s top 100 comedies for more laughs than this if you want to see a funnier drunk try the thin man funnier movie in general any marx brothers movie will kill 
just ppv d this i don t want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than i ever could but i did want to say a few things br br i didn t know which was funnier redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse close wailing that her precious boy has been turned into roadkill that the tone deaf ann schmoozed with peggy lee or the horrid cgi of crypt keeper annie gazing at her younger self br br i never bought danes as the younger redgrave i didn t buy richardson and collette as sisters either if meryl streep s daughter wants to be an actress she better get mama to give her a few lessons i had zero idea why any girl would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour harris ann s daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she luc is a retarded slacker on crack and i didn t give a rot about any of them evening gives chick flicks a bad name 
stanley kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things action and thrills the domino principle features gene hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task richard widmark edward albert and eli wallach are his operatives  they presumably work for the government but that like most of the movie s plot line is never made clear hackman asks a lot of questions that never get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere while it strives to be like night moves and the parallax view the domino principle mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom the film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it kramer s direction is devoid of any style it s a very sunny movie br br the acting is fine with hackman proving he s pretty much incapable of being bad widmark and wallach are suitably nasty and albert is well cast as widmark s cruel lackey even the usually obnoxious mickey rooney is pretty good as hackman s sidekick one oddity however is the casting of candice bergen as hackman s wife we re told she s done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang kramer s idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig it s a role better suited for the likes of valerie perrine or susan tyrell 
i have not seen many low budget films i must admit but this is the worst movie ever probably the main character the old man talked like he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds a 5 year old could act better the story had the most awful plot and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was and hoped it was leading onto the real movie i cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight i think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman i think the only thing ok with the budget was the make up but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit awful simply awful 
a decent sequel but does not pack the punch of the original a murderous screenwriterassumes new identities in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake still ruthless killing but movie seems very tongue in cheek any humor is not of the funny kind total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times nelson is way over the top this movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen this should have happened to this script 
i am a huge adam sandler fan and one day i was looking at the cast crew selection on one of his dvd s and saw going overboard and decided to go out and rent it so i went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it we put it on and we were shocked to see an adam sandler that didn t hit puberty yet he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out i couldn t even watch 30 minutes of this crap i didn t laugh chuckle or even smirk at this movie actually the only time i smirked was when i saw how horrid this movie was i could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie and it didn t work once although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script i realized why i had never heard of this movie because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before this movie in my opinion was the worst movie ever made  ever 
this film though ostensibly a comedy is deadly serious its subject is imperialism how britain foolishly humiliatingly tries to convince itself that it s still a great power after world war ii at home the empire is run by amiable dolts benevolent tories who are so in bred that they can t distinguish close relatives the offices of government consist of long forgotten archives inhabited by indolent rats and ante rooms wherein lounge bored synacures reading popular novels br br abroad britain clings to the old pomp but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly especially when its embodied in bumbling twits carlton browne is an unsentimental picture of decline with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti imperialist jewel in the crown br br the film is also about the cold war bravely admitting that it s a dangerous farce whose participants deserve mockery and contempt not fear and respect it s about how colonialism characterised more by neglect than tyranny destroys the colonies it deserts robbing them of amenities power and most importantly self respect leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys br br it s the seriousness of course that kills it that s not to say that weighty subjects can t be treated in comedy the miracle of morgan s creek dr strangelove and the life of brian have all proved that indeed one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy it allows for a clearer eyed view br br the problem with carlton browne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny in the three films mentioned above much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation not the extreme situation itself here the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled peter sellers terry thomas raymond huntley and john le mesurier are criminally wasted br br terry thomas sublime so often shows that he couldn t handle lead parts and that he needed to play sneering arrogant bounders not brainless toffs the music is made to carry much of the comedy but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen only huntley manages to raise genuine laughs and that s by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep br br none of the boultings farces have dated well they re never thought through enough although carlton browne revels in the decline of the empire it also seems to be anti democratic and militaristic i m sure this wasn t intended but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form 
michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top billed character in the golden child and because he loves kids that didn t work so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing kid midas i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor s inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy that s a step closer to ishtar whatever murphy says or does can be best liked but don t get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent he doesn t belong in this movie and the same went for dr dolittle the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and that wouldn t have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagan s presidential fame murphy is far better at coming to america and 48 hrs but this stale movie isn t my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste 
a slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of neworleans black women by white men of power and privilege ooh does that whet your appetite well then belly up to a vhs or dvd and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history for good measure it s adapted from the book by celebrated hack anne rice the directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog most of acting is amateurish the production s sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today s market including some faces that have barely been seen at all it also is despite itself a sterling showcase for nicole lyn the pompous and ponderous james earl jones is on hand as well so is the late ossie davis a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary negro ensemble company this film should be rated t for tripe 
one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early 50 s there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon we re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic br br there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but it s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever br br however the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them i m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears i think we can thank verhoeven for that 
i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel violated i had read the reviews and heard the warnings and i thought i was prepared for anything at best i thought a faithful attempt at an original adaptation at worst a so good it s bad plan 9 for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in walmart while in florida and brought it back to the uk i joked to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel karma there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum zx81 the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible the dialogue is stilted the editing is non existent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly cgi d thunderchild to the woodworm ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literally zero budget fan films that are available on the net the whole we re enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the pendragon website this film had an 8 figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was darlene sellers the ex soft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesn t screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a lifelong hg wells fan speilbergs film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back 
i thought hedy burress was going to be in part 2 guess not i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the 13th part 2 br br this movie like scream 3 and urban legend 2 followed movies within a movie br br this was pure crap the whole movie within a movie crap br br bad stay away 
as a southern baptist it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly aren t so many that i want to discourage film makers from a genre that s woefully under exploited still i must honestly say that love s abiding joy is a typically low budget low key self consciously christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys you ve got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k chesterton or c s lewis for some inspiration 
but cinderella gets my vote not only for the worst of disney s princess movies but for the worst movie the company made during walt s lifetime the music is genuinely pretty and the story deserves to be called classic what fails in this movie are the characters particularly the title character who could only be called the heroine in the loosest sense of the term br br after a brief prologue the audience is introduced to cinderella she is waking up in the morning and singing a dream is a wish your heart makes this establishes her as an idealist unfortunately the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about freedom from her servant role the respect of her step family someone to talk to besides mice and birds in one song cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently you go girlfriend in short cinderella is a very bland character she passively accepts her step family s abuse escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief she only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family for this she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except of course cinderella can anyone see belle or jasmine being such a doormat if cinderella is dull her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless the prince in cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time we are given no indication if he is a good man if he respects cinderella or anything all we know is 1 he is a prince and 2 he dances well heck even the prince from snow white got to sing a romantic song at least not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting it makes cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot weakening her already tenuous appeal br br perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie s comic relief cinderella s friends the mice granted these characters are amusing even so when the comic relief steals the show from the principals well let s just say your story has some problems br br dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as masterpieces while many of them are there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way cinderella is a prime example of this fact 
wow is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it trust me watch it br br i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny i cant believe they superimposed the school sign i must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time if a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies even the costume was bad it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out just not like this one 
all for love is a romantic period drama featuring captain saint ives a french officer in napoleon s army who is captured by the british and imprisoned in scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison there s also a storyline involving a murder br br i will be honest and confess that i wasn t too taken by the movie since i m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but i will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it s got a good cast that features miranda richardson anna friel richard e grant michael gough and jason isaacs the costume design as you can expect is also excellent br br i ll be very surprised if this movie doesn t get any complaints after being broadcast on bbc2 at teatime captain saint ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there s a scene of french prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen you really do have to worry if bbc schedulers have any type of clue as to what they re doing
im watching it now on pink and i must say this is a crap shallow no acting effects too sloppy i mean who made this series br br this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film ok the film was great in 1994 when it came out but the series br br some times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters i mean did they actually pay someone to write that was that someones relative at the studio this is no scifi br br the film was the bomb the series suck 
the fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour in fact there are more questions than answers in this one sided tale of romance and murder and since we are only provided with the prosecution s side none of these questions will be answered this is the type of fare that appeals to the he woman man hater clubs of america as presented it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be caught up in a romance with a married high profile attorney is it possible that if she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man the whole nasty murderous sordid incident could have been avoided when you watch this don t worry about going to the fridge you won t miss anything 
instead go to the zoo buy some peanuts and feed em to the monkeys monkeys are funny people with amnesia who don t say much just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny br br black comedy there isn t a black person in it and there isn t one funny thing in it either br br walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack it s labeled unrated i think they took out the topless scene they may have taken out other stuff too who knows all we know is that whatever they took out isn t there any more br br the acting seemed ok to me there s a lot of unfathomables tho it s supposed to be a city it s supposed to be a big lake if it s so hot in the church people are fanning themselves why are they all wearing coats 
besides being boring the scenes were oppressive and dark the movie tried to portray some kind of moral but fell flat with its message what were the redeeming qualities on top of that i don t think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did 
in my knowledge largo winch was a famous belgium comics telling the adventures of a playboy a sort of james bond without the spy life so when i had to choose a movie for a 5 years old kid i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bond br br but just after the opening credits i got heavy doubts when american movies offer amazing start here no action and a torrid sex scene  then the story get very complicated with financial moves i thought i lost the kid br br but strangely he had been caught by largo and more than james bond br br was it the excellent interpretation of tomer sisley the difficult relationship largo has with his father the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys the bad guys are the friends the exotic locations of honk kong yougoslavia br br dunno but he really cares about largo and we enjoyed our moment 
its not the cast a finer group of actors you could not find its not the setting the director is in love with new york city and by the end of the film so are we all woody allen could not improve upon what bogdonovich has done here if you are going to fall in love or find love manhattan is the place to go no the problem with the movie is the script there is none the actors fall in love at first sight words are unnecessary in the director s own experience in hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set it is reality to him and his peers but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world so in the end the movie is hollow and shallow and message less 
horrible film with bits of the ramones strewn about your worse than average 1970 s 80 s comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan this movie is terrible the plot consists of a girl who enjoys the ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration forget this movie and watch something like wild zero starring guitar wolf if you want an entertaining b movie terrible acting terrible writing terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie that is the only logical thing i can think of because this movie blows 
after an initial release of 4 very good eurotrash titles redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this movie br br the story is simple a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one who is the killer who knows there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on friday br br the pace is excruciating the story is silly and the skin scenes aren t all that terrific either br br give this one a miss 
those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from akshay kumar i know bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but please a walt disney production is more realistic than this plot the father is dying and does what any good parent does kick his son out the son with his pregnant wife a few things that were too hard to swallow 1 priyanka cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom and to go from that to living hungry in her in laws garden shed  2 akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man gets bitten by rabified dogs to then just walk off this film is an insult to our intelligence i really cant believe i contributed financially to the people who made this film by taking my family to see it we left the cinema with a frown please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your waqt 
it s not like i have overwhelmingly fond memories of verhoeven s original pants down shocker it always struck me as a glossy well made airport novel of a movie thrilling sexy trash but trash nonetheless it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist after a decade of anti sex aids induced hysteria a film about a wildly sexual hotbod who thrill kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy so the fact that it s desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort of be overlooked all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable that it resoundingly fails on so many levels and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved is really quite extraordinary to watch let s state the obvious for starters sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell what was so photogenic thru verhoeven s lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun for hire michael caton jones who s flat drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot i like sharon stone a lot but if the first film launched her career bi2 could kill it she has no chemistry with stuffed shirt david morrissey their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch his dough faced mamma s boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering orange skin machismo of michael douglas supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché heavy posturing and what of the much touted sexual shenanigans poorly lit fleetingly glimpsed as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed don t watch this film for carnal thrills there are none and what there is is tragic the film is as a whole convoluted to the point of utter confusion boring and laughable the last 40 minutes in particular where you come to the realisation that the film is in fact not going to go anywhere of interest at all are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure as a failed sequel basic instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the heretic beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx2 as a vanity project it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception as a multi million dollar piece of hollywood film making it s a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst 
i have been looking for this film for ages because it is quite rare to find as it was one of the video nasties i finally found it on dvd at the end of last year it is a very low budget movie the story is set around amazon jungle tribes that are living in fear of the devil laura crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while she is working in south america they take her into the jungle laura is guarded by some ridiculous native who calls himself the devil she has to go though all unpleasant things until they are happy maidens are chained up the devil demonstrates eating flesh in a horrible manner peter weston is the devil hunter who goes into the jungle to try and rescue her 
i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented i mean i hate to say bad things about an amateur production but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it tone it down a little groundbreaking is a little over the top this is a boston based college production that doesn t even achieve the level of most amateur college film it s what you would expect a bunch of kids to do a silly action film without much creativity it s pretty funny if you re willing to poke fun at it not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college 
i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future ending up was sad br br the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12 00pm on 08 10 06 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicate br br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i don t feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story br br the two main reasons i don t like this movie are firstly the film didn t told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesn t make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didn t have a scene of alex and kik s sexual intercourse that s what i was waiting for however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik s love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate 
despite the high ratings given to this film by imdb users this is nothing more than your typical girl with a bad childhood obsessively stalks married man film the attractive justine priestly s brief nude scenes may attract voyeurs but the film is hackneyed tripe br br  1 2 out of  
or anyone who was praying for the sight of al cliver wrestling a naked 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson your film has arrived film starlet laura crawford is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of 6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway what they don t count on is rugged vietnam vet peter weston being hired by a film producer to save the girl and what they really didn t count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes br br pretty much the same filming set up as cannibals this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes franco gets a strong eurocult supporting cast including gisela hahn and werner pochath the film features tons of nudity and the gore is there the highlight for me was the world s slowly fistfight between cliver and antonio de cabo in the splashing waves sadly ol jess pads this one out to an astonishing 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops br br for the most part the severin dvd looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes also one long section of dialog is in spanish with no subs franco gives a nice 16 minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about buchfellner than his cannibals star sabrina siani 
okay so i just got back before i start my review let me tell you one thing i wanted to like this movie i know i ve been negative in the past but i was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film i didn t br br it s not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this and it s not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare it just wasn t scary one thing i was surprised about there was more blood than i thought there was going to be which isn t saying much br br the film starts off with donna being dropped off by lisa s mom at her house she comes in goes upstairs camera pans to her father dead on the couch spooky she goes upstairs where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens finds her brother on his bed apparently dead killer comes in donna hides under bed mom dies she runs outside screaming for help killer behind her i did it for us cut to therapy session this confused a lot of people everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back filler dialogue ensues br br they cut to the chase pretty quick few scenes at the salon they go to the hotel of course the killer is already there more filler ensues br br i m not going to go on about what happens in the film because i don t want to spoil it too much if you want to know who dies horror _ fan made a post about it already but on the subjects of deaths they weren t that exciting people in the theatre actually laughed out loud during several of them one in particular the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious scared face i ve ever seen the only death involving any blood was lisa s and that was pretty scarce her throat is slashed blood splatters on the curtain thing the only other blood was on claire when we see her body apparently fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death um okay the movie was one of the most clichéd i ve ever seen let s see here obligatory close mirror curtain boom scene check twice actually mandatory backing up into killer check there s also the backing up into lamp scene but you ve all seen that oh you say you want a birds flying away scare well you got it and of course the we have security on all exits but he still escaped scene shall i go on i could br br for anyone saying the characters weren t stupid are you kidding me oh even though the massive alarm is ringing literally saying please vacate the building and 3 of my friends are missing i m going to go upstairs to get my wrap these characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever the only likable character lisa made one of the most stupid moves in the movie oh i just realized the psycho teacher is here i must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her oh shoot the elevator is being to slow guess i ll take the stairs and run off into the construction site ugh by the end of the film they all deserved to die the only death anyone felt any remorse for was donna s boyfriend and by that time the audience was completely drained out of this scareless clichéd film br br there were some positives the acting was decent for the most part and it was well shot but that s about it br br i d give it a 1 5 and that s being generous just for the laughs and brittany snow br br oh and the reaction was bad very bad people were boo ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative expect bad legs for this one 
many king fans hate this because it departed from the book but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump that notwithstanding the movie does fail completely but it fails entirely on film terms i d like to smack the people who tell me it s the scariest movie ever made i always follow up with the question really exactly what scene scared you every fan i ve asked goes silent occasionally someone at a loss for a decent scare names the grape juice shooting out of elevators shtick if you re afraid of that i don t know what to tell you except maybe that you re easily scared i just rolled my eyes watching these z grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky incoherent movie br br one place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get mr halloran up to the overlook only to kill him with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes halloran forever to walk down really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film br br oh and nice choice for mr halloran s artwork stanley black light afro nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie has there ever been a more off out of place shot in any movie ever made br br i consider it a miracle that i was eventually able to bypass this turd and agree that kubricks 2001 is a truly important film given the immense bad will generated by both this stupid stupid movie and the cult of fawning but inarticulate kubrick fan boys who couldn t describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the library of congress in front of them br br toss in the grotesque overacting of jack nicholson the introduction of dumb one liners at tense moments and the razzie nominated performance of shelly duvall and you have a very crappy movie 
hines and goforth the perpetrators of this crime begin on the wrong foot first step by assuming that wells wrote gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously that simply isn t true wells was very much an inheritor of the enlightenment and his main concern was that victorian self satisfaction might leave the british unprepared for the world the new technology could produce both the good and the bad br br two terrible consequences follow the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe and the dialog reeks of victorianisms uttered seriously that welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek br br all of this looks suspiciously like ed wood with an enormous budget to waste on cgi effects which by the way are so poorly accomplished the warner bros cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job think the yellow submarine as done by the old ec comics br br worse yet is the loss of theme which robs the film of any reason to exist although the makers of this film return the story to its victorian era they utterly miss the uncanny way wells story predicted many of the horrors of the first world war a fact not unnoticed by wells himself who after the war reworked the theme in the shape of things to come br br without any theme all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons when they re not trying out for a high school production of a drunken student s rewrite of macbeth br br really this is the worst most senseless piece of drivel i have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the eastern european cartoon fantastic planet thirty years ago that film was so pretentiously dull my friend and i and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about half way through and sat near the screen playing cards using the movie as light by which to see the cards its only usefulness as far as any of us could tell br br but i already have electric lighting in my apartment so i didn t need this put down of wells for anything br br do not avoid this film steal every copy you can and burn each and every one of them god in his wisdom created us just for this purpose 
watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler truly a slow and painful death br br bought the dvd in the 5 88 bin at wal mart but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is how can i get my money back br br the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sink br br best constructive suggestion mystery comedy theatre you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks immediately spin off a comedy program and feature this flick without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws br br 
this show was absolutely terrible for one george isn t funny and his kids are snobby little brats he also treats his mother with no respect as a hispanic i am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed br br plus the dysfunctional family thing s been done to death for once i want to see something original what makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times i thought abc would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air but sadly we re going to have to stomach this until they jump the shark br br in my opinion they already did 
protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie s charm just doesn t save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan don t go out of your way to see this film 
spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone br br this movie really annoyed me it has a great looking monster has some good low budget effects some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad half way in i started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the dvd br br the problems with this movie are many first off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school you don t believe anything from the get go as a result the scarecrow while looking great isn t much beyond that he says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary is this a comedy or a horror movie its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up it seems more send up of every cliché than heartfelt horror film i some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it br br despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks you re paying too much br br avoid 
 in a horror movie that is alright first off lets start with kate her main goals include getting laid by george clooney looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over gotta love her she had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but  instead she ran i mean she didn t wanna bring guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late i mean the guy tried to rape her i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night the movie kept going on and as a result lost all its credibility 
despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential set as a prequel to the original star trek series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer rick berman who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a star trek series could be the actual show runner brannon braga didn t help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise s internal mythology never have i seen a series that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors last so long it is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires unfortunately it appears as if berman and braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at paramount that enterprise suffered from franchise fatigue and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they will come br br simply put in a teevee universe where we are given shows like battlestar galactica and the shield the powers that be must give the viewing public a star trek that measures up and is dramatically competitive it is just that straightforward and easy 
i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics and i m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for it br br it gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face bad guys enter the temple br br child sits with blank expression br br bad guys chop up the monks br br child sits with blank expression br br bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with  go on guess you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson s wonderland ranch he d still give the same blank expression this movie would be better titled the wooden child br br the title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening in fact that s the main problem with this movie the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be it s part fantasy part martial arts part buddy movie part comedy and it s all crap
this movie sucked it really was a waste of my life the acting was atrocious the plot completely implausible long long story short these people get terrorized by this pathetic crazed killer but completely fail to fight back in any manner and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip with no gear and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones additionally after their boat goes missing they panic that they re stuck in the woods but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them like i said this movie sucks a complete joke don t let your girlfriend talk you into watching it 
having seen the first ten episodes i must say this show sucks br br what bothers me the most is that the show was shot in canada i know it s cheaper but they should have shot it in california so we could have had scenes in the desert that would have been more true to the movie the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold that does nt feel very egyptian what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt here it feels like they re running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest and it s so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb br br and then there is richard dean anderson he is no kurt russel sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as russel and not nearly as good an actor as russel and russells way of playing o neill well he was much more cynical andersons o neil is way too soft i liked it that russels version just did nt give a s and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie br br michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spader br br teal c is a really annoying character he is jaffa not a jaffa just jaffa aaaarrgh a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far teal c speaks talks and acts like a robot i ve seen better acting from jean claude van damme br br and the fact that teal c and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters br br as for the special effects they are really good in the pilot but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap especially a planet they visit with crystals it s so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background it s an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds br br the x files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993 that was 4 years before sg 1 started and they did nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that sg 1 supposedly had they must have spend all the money on catering because i don t see it on the screen br br incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters 
i was looking for a cute simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake br br i can t write a single good thing about it first the script is stupid and not funny at all relying on tired recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs in my book that s not funny that s pathetic br br low budget effects with horrible cinematography in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money br br acting i feel sorry for the actors are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they ve agreed to take part in this despite the outfits pamela is showing her age and as a whole they don t even come across as sexy let alone funny br br this movie is not even in the so bad it is funny category it s just bad as if everybody involved was sick of it br br avoid 
i m not looking for quality i m just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in britain this one was initially banned and re released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut br br some college kids spend their christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation there are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids which of them is the slasher the actual killings are not very gory so this video nastie is not really nasty there is the requisite flashing of the boobies but it has nothing to do with the college kids br br i had a suspect very quickly and i turned out to be right maybe i ve seen too many of these the end twist was clever i have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality 
the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes the ending was even worse everyone kept dying but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok they did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had etc the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline the only reason i give this 3 10 is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors they needed better coaching they could have really made this an ok film but the screenplay and acting failed miserably 
i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes i have seen cujo adam sandler is an abomination as schecky moskowitz a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner that s the plot br br that s it nothing else in the film makes sense it s all over the place like a mad man s breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating throw both shoes at the t v kind of way even general noriega makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend add to the mix miss australia who has the worst australian accent i ve ever heared and you have something which i won t call the worst film ever made because going overboard doesn t even fit the basic definition of a film i highly recomend seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see i guarantee the first thing you ll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasn t as bad as going overboard 
 br br rosenstraße is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time but it is way too long it is not touching and sometimes even boring there are too many clichés and not enough good acting br br the storytelling is bad like in james cameron s titanic an old woman remembers events of her live good now we ve got a point of view than there is another woman introduced who does the same confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people come on this is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling how can riemann know about the fate of the little girl s mother and her interrogation for example br br the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian when did that happen the scene looks like it is set in the twenties br br riemann s character is of course a talented pianist well she is even a baroness wow her brother comes back from the eastern front he has received a ritterkreuz which he is showing in some scenes so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans he even made some photographs and so it goes cliché after cliché is piling up and this is why the movie does not work br br basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie and in the end it s all very simple riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and ta da everyone is free which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the true story claim at the beginning like sass it is vaguely based on a true event br br it is sad but true this is the typical german movie these days it is bad macaulay j connor br br 
while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian keith s ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind 
i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie i found it to be absolutely idiotic the mother gets visions when she touches certain things or people and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue just seemed so ridiculous deedee pfieffer s performance was awful i thought she was very irritating the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with br br i usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me 
an executive very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life meets a boy with down syndrome escaped from a residence both characters feel very alone and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life with this argument the somehow amelie like atmosphere and the sentimental music i didn t expect but a moralistic disgusting movie anyway as there were some interesting scenes and the interpretation of both actors daniel auteil and pasqal duquenne was very good i decided to go on watching the movie the french cinema in general has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life opposed to the more stereotyped american cinema but because of that it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending with the impossible death of the boy the charming tone the happiness of the executive s family the cheap moral the unbearable laughter of the daughters the guy waving from heaven as michael landon really nasty in my humble opinion 
this fanciful horror flick has vincent price playing a mad magician that realizes his vocational talents have been sold to another he devise ways of avenging all those that have wronged him his master scheme seems to back fire on him br br price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces but is still the only reason to watch this thriller supporting cast includes patrick o neal mary murphy eva gabor and jay novello br br 
the horror channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning but their scare factor is very limited if one exists at all in fact i am sure i will find a multi million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer br br the bloodsucker leads the dance deserves special mention because it is i feel the undisputed low of a channel full of lows i cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site i will at least give it a go br br firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen in fact the film might as well have been called toothbrush or wallpaper for all it has to do with the plot at least they used toothbrushes at least they had wallpaper br br there are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances not one i m sure they were making two different films by mistake here br br a more suitable title would have been horny italian count leads five people to a scary castle and bores us silly for ninety minutes yes that fits better br br the acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling and that guy who plays seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character abysmal br br the only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off bonus br br otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one no vampires no dancing no scenes of a brutal or gruesome nature and no way on gods earth i will ever ever ever watch this one again br br no word of a lie this film could put you off motion pictures for life 
a model named laura is working in south america when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle they demand a huge ransom for her release peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend jack they try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter the helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts in reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem he starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives the rest of the film is a bit of a blur really br br now i m not a massive jess franco fan in fact to date this is only the second film of his i have seen but even i can tell that this really isn t one of his best efforts the films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening the whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute tv show there are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out br br devil hunter is poorly lit badly dubbed poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn t bore me i think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it for example a scene where laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him it has to be seen to be believed then of course there is the actual devil it is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes he has very blurry vision br br the film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80 s here in the uk and was banned now why it was i have no idea there is very little gore at all and it s hardly a shocking film minus the nudity i would have said that it could get away with a pg almost the only thing i can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth br br there is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive jess franco fan there is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise i would say just pay for a ticket to south america and get lost in a jungle it would probably be more fun br br 3 10
back in the 1970s wpix ran the adventures of superman every weekday afternoon for quite a few years every once in a while we d get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air superman and the mole men i always looked forward to those days watching it recently i was surprised at just how bad it really was br br it wasn t bad because of the special effects or lack thereof true george reeves superman costume was pretty bad the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible and true the mole men s costumes were even worse what was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn t have fooled a ten year old since the zippers sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious but these were forgivable shortcomings br br no what made it bad were the contrived plot devices time and again superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating a lynch mob is searching for the creatures rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to lois and the pr man the creatures are cornered again he stands around watching and talking but doesn t save them until they re shot luke benson the town s rabble rouser shoots at him attempted murder to any reasonable person but superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud but never once took advantage of them br br that said both george reeves and phyllis coates played their characters well seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles if only they had been given a better script to work with 
ok the movie is good but i give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron s paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus first of all strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus an organic virus is much more complex even though it s way tinier though it s considered one of the simplest forms in the universe organic virus s attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna then change your own rna code explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor maybe the radiation has some effect on the user s cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses i could see that but obviously the writer didn t think of that 
this should not have been listed as a colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other colombo ever made this should have been listed as a movie starring peter falk and not playing the caracter of colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant colombo 
listening to the director s commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they re going through that i could write a book screenplay award winning sitcom phase there s a germ of an interesting idea buried in there but it is totally buried under an underwritten badly executed and laughably un thought out script br br the lines are dire and the performances are un engaging though again i m inclined to blame the director he does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required rather plonked the script in their hands pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it who knows with a little coaching these actors could have acquitted themselves better br br as it stands the cast have no chemistry whatsoever a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when in order to infect bon jovi s character with vampire blood from his ailing co hunter he is given a transfusion she should have bitten him mind you they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too the only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leads is by the directors own admittance accidental he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition so i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse but not a lot br br frankly as movies go this is badly plotted silly and forgettable even as trashy movies go it s not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining it could have been a fun and bloody little romp but the director has left with more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons 
my wife and i thought that with this cast and director the movie would have to be at least worth watching we were wrong in fact we gave up on it after 45 minutes the idea that crawford young and tone are british but speak with american accents was for me impossible to get past hard to believe this is england when no one talks with a british accent there is zero chemistry between crawford and anyone and to echo a previous comment the idea that cooper and crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous there is no reason to care about any of the characters which is why we threw in the towel halfway through i found it hard to believe that hawks directed this as none of the actors spoke with the trademark hawksian rat a tat delivery so save your time and skip this one 
okay i must say that before the revealing of the monster saying that he really didn t fit into that category just some weird thing that had an annoying screech and personally i think a granny could have ran away from that thing but anyway i actually was getting into this film although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict didn t come as an appeal but such scenes as when she runs away from the train and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy also where the guard had just been killed and the monster put his hand on the screen br br but then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror with limited thrills or scares slowly i became more bored and wanted to shut the thing off i like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it specially the guy he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there i think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are just boring and well not worth the money br br if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there or a mindless gore fest by all means give it a go but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else much better films out there 
ah bait how do i hate thee let me count the ways 1 you try to be funny but are corny and unenjoyable every joke is predictable and expected and when it comes does not inspire laughter instead i want to hurl 2 you try to be dramatic but are unbelievable the woman overacts to a terrible degree and the bad guy looks like bill gates and is about as scary as well bill gates as for jamie foxx well just watching him try to deliver a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ludicrous and makes me want to hurl 3 you try to be action packed but instead are dull and dragging too many times and when the action heats up the tripod for the camera must have been lost for the scenes wobble more than those in the blair witch project and i find myself nauseated and once again i want to hurl 4 you try to be a good movie but you failed you failed you failed i would rather walk barefoot across the sahara with a pack full of beef jerky and no water no sunscreen and only meryl streep for company this hell would be lovelier than a single minute more spent watching everyone in bait overact their way through an idiotically written story with bill gates for a bad guy and let s not even talk about the massive bomb that goes off in a car that jamie foxx s character has just driven off a cliff but somehow manages to escape just kill me now or do the right thing and promise me that somehow i ll never have to watch a movie that is this bad ever again 
i was expecting a little something from k 911 i mean it did look like a cute movie that i could get into i always did love the dog comedy movies but it looked like it was supposed to be jame s movie not jerry lee s the plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn t have chemistry to begin with not to mention that james seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn t going in that direction james just really ticked me off for more than half the film the dogs were the true stars and that s pretty sad that they out shined the actors br br so i m glad it s not just me on imdb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie but hopefully james will realize it was his brother jim who was the talented one no offense but not everyone can be their star sibling don t you wish ashlee simpson would take that same advice d br br 3 10
when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television we ve all been guilty of it at some time or another but my excuse for watching things like buck rogers in the 25th century and silver spoons is this i was young and naive ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile br br thankfully i now appreciate the good stuff stargate sg 1 is not good the 12 year old me would love every hackneyed bit of it every line of stilted dialogue every bit of needless technobabble the writing is beyond insipid so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek voyager if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever you re in trouble br br the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture a wonderful musical score and cool sci fi ideas with the exception of a little of the original music none of what made the film fun appears in this show even richard dean anderson who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting seems like he s half asleep most episodes br br the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody s basement the cinematography isn t much better as vanilla and dull as the scripts it amazes me that shows with a lot more style and substance have smaller less rabid fanbases than this pap it just doesn t deserve it 
all i can really say is that i m glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life the acting was terrible the plot was even worse there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of mst3k 
i have this film out of the library right now and i haven t finished watching it it is so bad i am in disbelief audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then although she d pretty much finished with it in robin and marian this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film it s really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide br br there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest palest shadow br br who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in breakfast at tiffany s twenty years earlier the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious you sure don t have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you br br reverting to type means going back up as well as going back down i guess in this case audrey hepburn s chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star here she has even lost her talent as a star if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period like ann margret had played the role there would have been some life in it even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid level situations br br hepburn was a great person of course greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors after this dreadful performance she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called love among thieves in they all laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50 s even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn turner took acting seriously even when she was bad hepburn doesn t take it seriously at all couldn t be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky her last really good work was in two for the road perhaps her most perfect if possibly not her best in many ways br br and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening john ritter is horrible there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten who was truly pretty otherwise critic david thomson s oft used phrase losing his her talent never has made more sense br br ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburn who could ask for anything less sandra dee s last pitiful film lost from 2 years later a low budget nothing had more to it than this at least ms dee spoke in her own voice by 1981 audrey hepburn s accent just sounded silly she d go on to do the pbs gardens of the world with audrey hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what i like most is when flowers go back to nature as in naturalized daffodils but in an actual fictional movie she just sounds ridiculous br br to think that breakfast at tiffany s was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in my fair lady matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in last year at marienbad and then this and her final brief role as the angel hap in the spielberg film always was just more of the lady stuff corny witless and stifling br br i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the shaker hymn simple gifts the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn s singing moon river on the fire escape in breakfast at tiffany s and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation br br a great lady who was once a fine actress and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50 s and 60 s who became a truly bad one that s not all that common and perhaps it is only a great human being who in making such things as film performances trivial nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly which all of her late film work contained in abundance most of the talk about hepburn s miscasting is about my fair lady but the one that should have had the original actress in it was wait until dark which had starred lee remick on broadway never as celebrated as hepburn she was a better actress in many ways although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part after that all of her acting went downhill 
this film like the first one has the same good and bad features perhaps even more so than the original unfortunately the bad outweighs the good br br the good magnificent scenery better than the first film i love those high country shots in australia tom burlinson is still a likable guy as jim craig bruce rowland did a nice job with the music too br br the bad once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine jessica who is a world class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her in this film we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father previously it was kirk douglas now replaced by the always profane brian dennehy speaking of that it is a disgrace that a walt disney film would includes usages of the lord s name in vain that was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s this film like the first one
this is not so much film as big budget children s television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as insomnia when it s first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man s long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off that s not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive 
how could i best express my feelings about this movie hideous a headache lack of coherent writing plain stupidity try all of the above for this travesty and that just for the direction br br story well i guess there is a story two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course they are mistaken for a world renounced assassin and are hired by two mobsters one thinks taking him out means a date and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of and of course the turtle reserve for the farting turtle that they build with the casino winnings br br sounds likes all this could be funny guess again they try to make it funny but its not filming sequences aren t well done i ve seen better filming in hong kong movies visuals are average for a late 80s film but the problem is that its a 2007 movie br br not worth my time to ever watch this again it still doesn t beat danny glover s out movie from the early 80s as the worst movie of all time but then again that film is in a class of its own f 
of the three titles from jess franco to find their way onto the official dpp video nasty list this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety being a dreadfully dull jungle clunker enlivened only very slightly by a little inept gore a gratuitous rape scene and loads of nudity br br gorgeous blonde ursula buchfellner plays movie star laura crawford who is abducted by a gang of ruthless kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by a savage tribe who worship the devil god that lurks in the jungle br br employed by laura s agent to deliver a 6million ransom brave mercenary peter weston and his vietnam vet pilot pal travel to the island but encounter trouble when the bad guys attempt a double cross during the confusion laura escapes into the jungle but runs straight into the arms of the island s natives who offer her up to their god br br franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual dreadful trademarks crap gore murky cinematography rapid zooms numerous crotch shots out of focus imagery awful sound effects and ham fisted editing the result is a dire mess that is a real struggle to sit through from start to finish and even the sight of the luscious buchfellner in all of her natural glory ain t enough to make me revisit this film in a hurry 
as an inspiring director myself this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for dof the editing is good acting decent sound effects aren t too over the top i would have give it a 7 for an indie film but the story aren t that interesting it s more on the drama side character developments than a horror flick br br it s not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy br br honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50 s br br this movie is about a family who has a dry field and that is just that 
the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker there are surprises twists and turns reverses and excitements at times this is truly an edge of the seat film but it disappoints and disappoints severely br br the villain of the piece is not believeable his character does not hold together i refuse to spoil the film but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end br br the second major disappointment of the film is that finally it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the friday the 13th films not that every film need always be totally tasteful but this film does drip gore on occasion br br though the film features the magnificent sean connery even he does not measure up to his usual standard and often just seems to be walking through the paces 
ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s i was shocked to find out it was released in 2001 secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would ve been better also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much it was bizarre and badly filmed the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand i love chinese epic films but if you re looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise not this film beware you will be disappointed 
after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel it just wasn t the same without spur and harrison as portrayed by douglas maybe he recognized how poor the plot was jim returns after extended absence to find jessica being pursued by another man he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him and not find competition for a disney movie this contains foul language plus the highly unnecessary part when jim jessica shacked up without being married very lame quite an insult to viewer intelligence according to members of my family i ll stick with the first one and try to forget i ever saw the sequel 
this film is just plain horrible john ritter doing pratt falls 75 of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards poor editing horrible sound mixing and a plot that really goes nowhere i didn t think i d ever say this but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film there are at least 3 others that suck more patti hansen delivers her lines with the passion of ben stein i started to wonder if she wasn t dead inside even bogdanovich s kids are awful this movie is seriously horrible there s a reason bogdanovich couldn t get another project until 4 years later please don t watch it if you see it in your television listings cancel your cable if a friend suggests it to you reconsider your friendship if your spouse wants to watch it you re better off finding another soulmate i d rather gouge my eyes out with lawn darts than sit through this piece of garbage again if i could sum this film up in one word that word would be suckotrocity
this movie in away was super clever it s theme rhymes with every single horror movie ever made valentine makes zero attempt to be original what is valentine anyway it s a bunch of people giving each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier there is nothing original in valentine br br i only saw it once and in that one viewing here are some of the films it ripped off 1 prom night 2 carrie 3 scream 4 any other horror movie in which somebody is killing somebody br br i know there is more but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk so it couldn t grab them as fast as they came br br valentine had no chance of being a good movie how come every horror movie has to have a suprise killer people you don t care about because their emotions take a turn every other scene one minute a nice girl turns into an evil b ch then she s an insecure woman and so on and son on br br normally any horror movie can be saved by gore once again valentine doesn t have this it was as if they tried to make it pg 13 but failed so they left the edit br br do not see this overly inspired rip off unless you hate yourself and you want to die br br 1 2 j leonard rollins 
what is jamie foxx supposed to be funny does he really believe he is funny well it s funny watching his confidence in being funny the man has no identity whatsoever i mean you can immediately see who his idols are denzel washington and martin lawrence because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies the only problem is that he does it bad uneven and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like denzel with that macho s t attitude and then abruptly goes to being martin lawrence the funny and clumsy silly comic there s no personal touch to all that i mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell and i m sure he has nothing to say personally he really is mr dull boy in person br br i was really hoping hollywood and the black community in america would find somebody better to launch into super stardom like don cheadle for example but perhaps the pathetic jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old 
i bet you gene simmons and vincent pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in isn t just too contrived for gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword and big pussy what the hell was that look at me i m a rat double episode crap all that cliché mafia banter come on the big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit hmm this is not reality but staged drama mark burnett s other show survivor also raised questions for me when johnny fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born br br yuk 
i like goldie hawn and wanted another one of her films so when i saw protocol for 5 50 at walmart i purchased it although mildly amusing the film never really hits it a stride some scenes such as a party scene in a bar just goes on for too long and really has no purpose br br then of course there is the preachy scene at the end of the film which gives the whole film a bad taste as far as i m concerned i don t think this scene added to the movie at all i don t like stupid comedies trying to teach me a lesson written by some 60 s burn out especially br br in the end although i m glad to possess another hawn movie i m not sure it was really worth the money i paid for it 
i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i m working oh i m sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like someones home movie and i don t think more than 100 was spent making it total crap who let s this stuff be released 
the director states in the behind the scenes feature that he loves horror movies he loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to dario argento as well as other notable directors such as george a romero and tobe hooper basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh t for mother s day the first thing they did wrong was the casting cast people that can act also don t cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood 18 year old recluse that s right he s been in high school for 22 years the reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn and his girlfriend just goes oh my god the scarecrow himself is quite a character doing flips off cars and calling people losers br br the movie does have one redeeming factor oh wait no it doesn t br br if you absolutely must see this movie than just watch the rock and roll trailer on the dvd it covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude 
yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money just how commercial did this film prove the film council who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london undergrounds disused stations for allowing this clichéd dismal specimen to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably deathline amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute it s a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film council could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare 
the performances of fishbourne and ed harris are remarkable unlike connery s who doesn t appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man in fact the screenplay doesn t make sense imagine a 60 min happy ending plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters it s more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen wrights schools the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets the capital punishment is not an issue here although it is a subject from the beginning it sort of fades away without further comment the subject matter and environment could have been good 
when i first saw the preview for this movie i really couldn t wait to see it the plot seemed good and the setting was great i mean a slasher movie that takes place on prom night great idea and the plot a high school teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students goes crazy gets arrested and escapes three years later on prom night prom night a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable turns into hell however i saw it and was extremely disappointed it was not only the worst horror movie i have ever seen but it was one of the worst movie in general that i have ever seen first of all it wasn t even scary there was not one moment in that movie when i jumped out of my seat also the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull all the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats also there was absolutely no gore the scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl he slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them br br next you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie he isn t mysterious creepy or scary he s just this guy who kills people br br also everything in the movie was so cliché an example is when at the end the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment the detective shoots and kills him also every single thing in this movie was so predictable the victim after seeing the guy with a knife runs for her life hides thinks she gets away and then the killer just pops out and kills her br br finally the sequence of the movie was extremely bad the guy goes into the hotel kills a few people the bodies are discovered someone pulls the fire alarm and everyone evacuates the main character forgets something in her room has an encounter with the killer runs and escapes thats it she and her boyfriend go home the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house finds the girl then gets killed by the detective the movie sequence was so stupid and cliché br br if your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good trust me don t waste your time or money no wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater my friend and i along with these two girls sitting in the back were the only ones in the theater that should have told me something about the movie beforehand 
imagine the scenario you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it s raining and you re finished with the museums you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don t have to engage your brain it s sold out options the bank job in bruges the leatherheads or prom night you ve seen the bank job and in bruges so you re down to two you don t fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms so you go see prom night right wrong you take the 8 50 walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for 8 50 it would be money better spent br br it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror thriller or whatever it is supposed to be if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn t know whether to laugh or cry probably both an insult to anyone s intelligence my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie as for the acting they might as well have cast robots in the roles they would have been more realistic the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen you are relieved on your title br br so in summary not good 
story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of it s singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level it s better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly 
lulu works as a typist and is missing something in her life she enters a miss france contest against the wishes of her boyfriend andre and she wins she sets off for the miss europe title leaving her boyfriend behind she wins again but returns home to andre because he has asked her to once back together her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as miss europe andre follows her br br this film is a silent film with a piano music track all the way through it is also sped up so everything seems fast limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony the cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film the best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long after watching this i m not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of louise brooks she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat i don t need to watch it again 
uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic edward woodward as the ghost of christmas present wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of bernard cribbins as scrooge george c scott is too wry and he never seems to truly believe in it which robs his performance of its effect the scenes in which he s shown his past have as much impact as if he was half heartedly flicking through his family album no one else seems to be putting any effort in except frank finlay who chronically overacts 
la sanguisuga conduce la danza or the bloodsucker leads the dance as i believe is it s common english title is set on ireland in 1902 where the mysterious count richard marnack invites soon to be out of work theatre actress evelyn three more of her fellow soon to be out of work actress friends cora penny rosalind to his castle situated on a small island just off the coast at first evelyn is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand samuel goes along as well once there count marnack tells his guests that his father grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife there s a feeling of unease when it turns out that evelyn looks exactly the same as the current count s wife who ran away not too long ago along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off br br this italian production was written directed by alfredo rizzo is total complete utter crap from start to finish first things first lets start the criticism with the title the bloodsucker leads the dance lets examine that title because when i do i feel somewhat cheated that there aren t any vampires or any form of bloodsucking whatsoever no one leads anything at anytime there most certainly isn t any dance or dancing so don t expect any of these things what you should expect though is a tedious dull boring pointless little giallo that takes over an hour before anyone is killed any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape the first hour of la sanguisuga conduce la danza is as plot less uninteresting as anything out there the best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring soft core porn film you ve ever seen then cut most of the soft core porn out that just leaves bad actors bad dubbing bad dialogue a tiny bit of soft core sex lesbianism absolutely nothing else yep it really is that bad the mystery elements are crap people do illogical things for no apparent reason the overly complicated twist ending is as bad as the rest of it the sixth sense this ain t br br director rozzi does an ok job la sanguisga conduce la danza actually has a nice look feel to it despite it s obvious low budget i mean there are scenes where he shows a storm raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black white so the film jumps from bright colour to black white whenever it cuts to the storm back to colour again there is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid her friend discuss her breasts she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments this scene is so funny just so unnatural that it s priceless easily the films best moment even if a bad 70 s porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue there is minimal nudity the sex lesbian scenes are very tame forget about any blood or gore as there isn t any apart from a decapitated head br br technically the films pretty good the period setting production design are actually quite impressive although it s not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough the film has a nice sense of colour the cinematography is fine the film is dubbed so it s hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible the dialogue is even worse than usual br br la sanguisuga conduce la danza is a terrible film it makes no sense it has virtually no story for over an hour it has possibly the most misleading title ever is really dull boring with a confused stupid twist ending as far as euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please don t waste your time as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid trivia note the notorious nazi exploitation horror film horrifying experiments of the s s last days aka ss hell camp the beast in heat was directed by luigi batzella he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in la sanguisuga conduce la danza 
i like musicals but as a dickens fan i hate this one mild spoilers starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse the poor of london coming out to sing fagin and dodger walking off into the sunset not exactly faithful to the novel as i recall dodger was publicly hanged and fagin went crazy in prison end of spoilers br br oliver reed is very weak as sykes doing little more than growling to indicate his evil worst however is mark lester as oliver who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he s really the main character his portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl guess they didn t realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in england br br self respecting dickens fans stick to david lean s amazing 1948 film or the bbc 6 hour adaptation from the mid 80 s avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical 
2 stars for kay francis she s wonderful and she didn t deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros threw her way br br the two pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme kay is a small town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger she wants to be an actress when a big shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities kay tells her husband she s going to the movies the hubby s biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby s ear that kay s not being truthful and he sets out looking for her he finds her w the actor in the hotel and he slugs the guy who falls over a railing lands face first in a pond and dies now here s the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based br br 1 the judge tells the jury that if it s determined that the man died before his head went into the water that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder br br 2 the hubby s lawyer after the conviction and sentencing tells kay that it s all her fault his reasoning is that if she hadn t gone over to the actor s room then her husband wouldn t have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him he tells her that she s the guilty one not her husband and she nods and agrees what the hell  the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place br br i can t even go on with this review the movie was just all too painful four years earlier in the pre code days you d never have caught kay playing such a wimp in true kay francis fashion though she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role this character was a far cry from pre code kay roles and real life spitfire kay francis br br steer way clear of this one there are much better kay francis vehicles out there 
i am very disappointed with k 911 the original good quality of k 9 doesn t exist any more this is more like a sitcom some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show that was crazy what s the deal with the change of police it seems like they are now lapd not san diego pd it is a completely different movie from 
blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it s a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn t worth a dime quigley is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet preston a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kid s birthday party and since his dad is a cheapo he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller coasters then he receives a birthday card and a check of 11 bucks how cheap is this family so he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous shea stanley were her parents mets fans he finds out he needs 200 to open a account meanwhile quigley gives his million to his banker friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a lackey named juice to get the unmarked ones when preston leaves his bike gets run over by quigley he s about to write a check when he spots the cops and bolts back home his parents scolded him about his busted up bike and gets grounded what their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike so preston forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that he s juice he gives preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid so preston buys a mansion under the name macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots shea and talks about opening his account kid you re loaded and you re talking about opening an account we soon realized shea is actually an fbi agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplice s then he told his cheapy dad he s got a job working for mr macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with shea in a fancy restaurant what a 10 year old wining and dining a 20 something fbi agent afterwards he takes her to a street geyser and playing around in the water messing up shea s 300 dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the others still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the beans and preston is being chased by quigley in a scene taken from the original script and afterwords he is hosting mr macintoshs birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldn t pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to macintosh which he doesn t know it s his son he s talking to and talks about preston should be a real kid and has his whole childhood ahead of him and wants preston to go home early what an hour ago you were grilling him about his finances so preston asks everyone to leave and sits alone pondering when quigley and the others break in to the house to make preston pay and so he faces then in a finale that rips off home alone quigley gets spun around in a ball while preston is driving a go kart juice gets hit in the groin and more antics ensue until the trio get preston cornered and when it seem all hope is lost shea and a bunch of swat guys come to save the day and so quigley and his crew get sent to jail but is there any hope for preston and shea there is and she kisses him in the lips what what what a grown woman kissed a kid in the lips come on is she mentally disabled i mean an fbi agent who knows the country s laws would risk her career to kiss a kid she could get arrested on the spot and the most creepiest part of all is that isn t goodbye and she ll see him in 6 or 7 years oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought what are they smoking the bottom line is that is a waste of time the morals are whacked it s flat as a tortilla the kid is annoying the villains are lame the comic relief isn t funny the brothers are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the plot s shallow and the only saving grace is the cinematography from bill pope which went on to shoot the matrix trilogy and two of the spider man films so people don t waste your money and go watch home alone instead br br this has been a samuel franco review 
i saw the capsule comment said great acting in my opinion these are two great actors giving horrible performances and with zero chemistry with one another for a great director in his all time worst effort robert de niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time jane fonda s performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character mostly because the character is so poorly written molasses like would be too swift an adjective for this film s excruciating pacing although the film s intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy watching it is a true bummer i give it 1 out of 10 truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that i have ever seen 
this has to be the worst movie i ve ever attempted to watch in the first 15 minutes there wasn t anything to keep my interest in this movie i was on vacation at the time and had plenty of time to devote to a just for the fun of it movie the condo we were staying in had this movie in stock they must have got it from the 1 store or something br br if you like adam sandler this is nothing like any other movie he s made this started with a bad premise and then just got worse there s nothing even remotely funny in it br br i ve watched a lot of movies including some i didn t care for but if you decide to waste your time on this movie don t say i didn t warn you 
i watched this show and i simply didn t find it funny at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because it s average compared to them 
 what a dud it began with some promise then became unfocused and wandered john cusack s cajun accent was laughable bridget fonda s role existed only to get a skirt into the film and pacino did pacino his entire generation of actors nicholson hackman caine hoffman have developed a standard performance that each can deliver effortlessly in their paycheck films this was one 
this show stinks for parents they usually want their kids to watch something good for them it is usually educational funny and bright br br is it educational no the doodlebops sing and that s it they usually sing about themselves they don t try teaching anything br br is it funny no the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke and laugh at it br br is it bright it s so bright it s painful as far as color s everything is extremely bright so that s good but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the doodlebop s therefore they are always happy a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad br br the show is also extremely cheesy every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny it s overkill br br for kids it s entertaining but past the age of 2 you won t want your kids to see it they ll never know how to grow up 
not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the 80 s but not for the 21st century 
if you are one of the people who finds according to jim great television comedy this is going to rock your world and might i add kudos for proving that good talent good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc which prefers to air crap like jim belushi s show year after year br br k 911 is a big steaming brown german shepherd sized thank you for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie it s exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve jim s comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee br br if you enjoy jim s work this movie is your reward 
it figures this is a french film lol with the emphasis on young girls with much older men why is it the french are so fixated on this kind of thing when the age difference is this great it really comes off as pervy valentina cervi is beautiful but she looks about 15 and the actor playing tassi her painting instructor looks well 50 is kind br br other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record of the real artemisia a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age old accusation that all great artists were men  she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant not only was she clearly assaulted and forced into a degrading sexual relationship but tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child br br the movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story very dramatic and not in need of any spicing up  because in some weird frencified way it s hotter to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather that s sexy  the truth is boring and seems too feminist politically correct br br it also disturbs me that this is only part of artemisia life considered interesting enough to film the fact that she painted for decades that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious florentine academy that she went on to have children oh that s boring stuff after all that s about a middle aged woman and they aren t hot like teenagers br br i understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film about a real historical character you need to create dialog have subplots create dramatic structure certainly some details can be sacrificed it s no big deal if the dates are moved a few years or if artemisia is played by a blonde actress or something like that but to turn her story around on her and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing it s even worse because the director is female she should be horribly ashamed of herself br br if you like this you will probably like dangerous beauty with rufus sewell and catherine mccormack similarly based on heavily re written history with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets bon appetit 
this was a movie i could not wait to see so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed for starters the movie has so little said about new york just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings streets bridges and cafes it really doesn t stay focused on the new york magic another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie i know that it is a remake but it is not a french style remake anyway here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies such as long and messy scenes no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style the story follows many lives and they somehow seem connected in the end i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone s happy ending so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each and there you have your 120 minutes if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast 
holy freaking god all freaking mighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing i ve seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the g strings imho most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage and you can tell there s no horse they re fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub par to 1992 s beyond the mind s eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever 
bela lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve part adventure serial playing the lead as frank chandler chandu the magician enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of white magic pushed against those of black while displaying vigourous fighting skill successfully wooing a young egyptian princess and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear complete with nautical cap the somewhat lumpy plot engages chandler chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee princess nadji and others from the clutches of the idol worshipping sect of ubasti which covets nadji s blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of lemuria director ray taylor an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly but repeated scenes and footage a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year s skull island setting from king kong and the port locale from son of kong reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial s running length of over two and one half hours and if viewed at one sitting becomes lacking in effect to most viewers unless insomniac 
well what s to say the golden child falls in the category so bad it s good eddie murphy is having some funny but you are still entertained chales dance has never been worse than his role as the villain sardo numspa br br who should watch the golden child hm difficult to say but my best guess would be people who likes embarrassing movies and can be entertained by bad acting bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog br br 4 out of 10
this game was made by sega being made by sega i didn t expect much but i also didn t expect this junk either for starters the camera angles work against you in this game the motorcycle is your means of getting around the motorcycle is the worst part in the game whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don t move you never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter the main character hardly talks even though he s got a voice that suits him the graphics are horrible you ride through trees on your bike the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible this game wouldn t even be worth renting 
this movie is not in anyway funny it tries to be funny with it s lame humor which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing when is this gonna end one thing you have to hand to them is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars it is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book even the ones that wasn t funny the first time it basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes br br to sum it all up this movie is blonde humor gone bad it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch it is just that bad 
i rented this one on dvd without any prior knowledge i was suspicious seeing michael madsen appearing in a movie i have never heard of but it was a freebie so why not check it out br br well my guess is that mr blonde would very much like to forget he s ever taken part in such a shame of a film br br apparently if your script and dialogs are terrible even good actors cannot save the day not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film too many non native english speakers play parts of native english speakers reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie it s unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound the music is awful and totally out of place and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play br br i recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other better movies this is why i gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves 
when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit as the plot takes on quite complex issues using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach still unfortunately despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays lesbians it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with br br however this does not mean that the film is directly bad as it s rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation br br even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when the ball drops this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy ending nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages one can t help but roll eyes towards the resolution personally i was close to shouting finish already at the screen br br there were some decent acting in the film and the two young female central characters had some good moments so did their parents and other bi characters however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism he didn t even appear very likable but rather self involved despite his good deeds which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained br br i give the film a 4 as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from the script and cast had many good believable characters giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others had the let downs not been this disappointing i d easily give the film a 7 or 8 if you enjoyed this film i d recommend the film east is east which i think is an as good if not better rendering of cultural conflict as well as being amusing and engaging 
the potential was there i saw creep and thought oooh this is getting interesting several times yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored like they never happened the lead character was irritating throughout the movie and at one point my fella and i both shouted that we wanted her to die there are some genuinely spooky scary moments but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me it s another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve br br the one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you re on to a loser 
the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that won t do for the tv series because most people watch for the 1930s style ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content 
some films that you pick up for a pound turn out to be rather good 23rd century films released dozens of obscure italian and american movie that were great but although hardgore released some fulci films amongst others the bulk of their output is crap like the zombie chronicles br br the only positive thing i can say about this film is that it s nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh other than that its a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a lego house built by a whelk br br it s been noted elsewhere but you really do have to worry about a film that inserts previews of the action into its credit sequence so by the time it gets to the zombie attacks you ve seen it all already br br bad movie fans will have a ball watching the 18 000 continuity mistakes and the diabolical acting of the cast and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of things by releasing a print so bad it felt like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip br br awful awful stuff we ve all made stuff like this when we ve gotten a hold of a camera but common sense prevails and these films languish in our cupboards somewhere avoid 
after being hugely entertained by mr brosnan s performance as a cad in the tailor of panama i enthusiastically anticipated this film i was hugely disappointed it is a script reading not a film vulgar for the sake of being vulgar bankrupt in every way that the tailor of panama is rich and satisfying blame it on the screen writing and directing i sat in the theater waiting for the good part it never came i neither laughed nor cried although one line of dialog did make me smile worth 7 hardly 
 here be spoilers  br br recap mia is returning home from capital stockholm to rural rättvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday she is by far the youngest child and has two sisters eivor and gunilla eivor has a family and still lives in rättvik and gunilla has divorced and moved a town away mia is still single and is focused on her career there are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle as the party goes on more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise br br comments to be the work of a new writer director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedy dramas has been following for years there are really no new elements or ideas this movie draws upon three basic areas 1 embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves 2 sorrow and 3 anxiety this move has the focus on the last one almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along no loss though since the humor that is there is not funny the performances from the cast are good i guess though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences but there were none to conclude there are better ways to spend one s time than watching this br br 3 10
this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects there are some interesting visuals br br aside from that it s typical nineties aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance true to the title br br it s not worth picking apart the story that s like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur there s not much there to begin with it s nothing original and not very special so don t go in for the story at all just look at the effects br br as has been mentioned it got a little flashy at the end diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible man however if you ignore the standard pyrotechnics it s a sight to behold br br all in all it s a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone 
this movie was awful the ending was absolutely horrible there was no plot to the movie whatsoever the only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by robert duvall and james earl jones their performances were excellent the only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice if the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story it would be worth watching instead robert duvall s and james earl jones performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline or lack thereof not only was i left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie well an actual movie not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason it was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time there was nothing special about any of the characters the only thing special was how robert duvall portrayed a rambling senile drunk old man nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end when the movie ended i sat amazed amazed that i sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while it never happened the cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and i realized that i had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning it wasn t even a story the entire movie takes place in a day s worth of time that s it it was one day in the life of some southerners on a plantation how much of a story can take place in a single day the acting performances by the entire cast were excellent but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie if you can even call it a movie 
in contrast to my fellow reviewers i always try to find something redeeming in any film i see yes the quality of the dubbing and lighting is abysmal the acting is wooden and the opening sequence highly misleading what with all those lascivious female lesbian vampires with blood dripping something must be lost in the translation of the word bloodsucker from the italian in the title almost as if the producers were originally going to film a gothic vampire tale and then changed their minds but could not afford to give up their dramatic opening sequence so tacked it onto the film anyway br br this film made in 1975 has recently been issued on dvd and comes with its own theatrical trailer which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film now anyone who buys this film has probably already read its synopsis anyway and knows what to expect italian softporn from the mid 1970s i bought it because i am attracted to christa nelli the absence of a cast of characters i find most frustrating in a lot of these eurosleaze films from the 60s 70s i had hoped imdb would show the cast of characters as one hears their names in the film but without a cast list it is very difficult to link them to the actor concerned i think krista nell played cora but underneath that massive hair style costume and make up it is difficult to distinguish her for sure br br there is mostly a two dimensional portrayal by the actors of their parts and no one really stands out maybe something is lost in the dubbing process what were the positive points well the music was atmospheric and of course if you re into beautiful lesbian soft porn its there the external locations used were good and i would like to know where they filmed the castle on its island it purports to be set in ireland in 1902 so everyone sports period piece costumes some of the scenes i found unintentionally funny especially those sex scenes anyway an enjoyable romp i rated it 4 10 
first of all there is gujarati theatre then there is bollywood both have their strengths and fan following director vipul shah should look elsewhere instead of gujarati theatre when making a bollywood production first he made aankhen which had a unique plot but could not hold as a hindi film now he s adapted another gujarati play and named it waqt a race against time in sum the emotions are alien the plot development is not for hindi films for example the role play between father and son is best left to gujarati theatre don t bring it in a hindi film even the comedy track is best left for the gujarati stage all performances are average nothing to shout about barring shefali chhaya shah who is fantastic 
i don t know why but after all the hype on npr i thought this was a new movie  all the best footage has been used for bbc docs and natgeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over dramatic music for disney to take advantage of earth day there are great moments and it is always nice to listen to darth vader  oops   james earl jones speak but i had hoped for a ground breaking movie considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film it has been sanitized for a child audience so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube  i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as koyannisquatsi and this movie is certainly not it
an uninteresting addition to the stalk n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980 s this was filmed as pranks but released as the dorm that dripped blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology the house that dripped blood daphne zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie 
saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was don t get me wrong george c scott was terrific as scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly sometimes i couldn t stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line merry christmas to everyone other times i almost fell asleep br br the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy who don t think christmas is nothing but humbug after 30 minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all br br i can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so well rated instead of this piece of garbage i recommend to you the bill murray comedy scrooged that at least was funny 
after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie i knew what was supposed to happen i had high expectations of the movie because of the rating the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie i have a couple main points for not liking this movie br br   spoilers  br br 1 the casting jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence s character also i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy i pictured wendy much differently i can see why they picked jack nicholson though the grin the pointy eyebrows but he s not supposed to really look evil he s supposed to look normal and he turns evil also they make one of the worst movie couples danny was alright he needed more life though he acted way to droney br br 2 the screenplay they cut out so many things that were in the book and added things some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted changed or handled wrongly some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing were not in the movie and it was 2 and half hours i was extremely irritated br br 3 the ending the ending was changed completly halorann died jack froze to death wendy never got hurt the overlook didn t blow up the ending was so cool in the book and the movie messed it up so horribly i was apalled hallorann was never supposed to die but jack killed him with an ax if they wanted to kill him at least have jack use a roque mallet you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie br br there are other things that i didn t like about the movie but there are things that were all right the camera angels were cool the blood coming out of the elevator was cool but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn t go with the book to try to be scared at all i reccomend reading the book before you see this movie i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more i would never have done that i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day i can t wait to see the 6 hour version at least it has the hedge animals br br rating 2 10
this movie was just plain bad just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for bad guy gets away check partner check wacky personality clash with partner check rookie with something to prove check rookie shows up grizzled veteran check about the only ones it didn t touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess they re saving those old chestnuts for dooley s next outing add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like dooley s prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie avoid this one at all costs 
this flick was a blow to me i guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models home makers or mistresses since that seems to be all they ll ever be portrayed as anyway it is truly saddening to see an artist s work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated inconcievably artemisia s entire character and all that she stands for had been reduced to a standard hollywood female character a pitiful physically flawless helpless little creature displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here sadder yet was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality to portray the artist as someone in love with her real life rapist someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture just plain pisses me off if the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person 
one scene demonstrates the mentality of terminator woman pretty well karen sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain s camp karen runs across an armed guard who points his gun at her but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight karen kicks him in the balls picks up the gun and runs away then again when a film is directed by a martial artist and written produced by another member of his family you know you shouldn t expect too much karen sheperd and jerry trimble do get some amusing banter going early on and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love hate relationship but after about 20 minutes they get separated and the film slows to a crawl and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up it lacks excitement the finale has trimble fighting qissi inside a cave and sheperd going womano a womano against the beautiful ashley hayden on a speedboat but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value on the positive side kudos to the costuming department for giving karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film 
in bridgeport the deranged high school teacher richard fenton is obsessed by the teenager student donna keppel she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life three years later the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills on her prom night she goes with her boyfriend bobby and two couples of friends to the pacific grad hotel for the party but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path br br the forgettable slash prom night is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality the stupid story is shallow and silly with a bad acting of johnathon schaech in the role of an insane killer the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes my vote is three br br title a morte convida para dançar 
from the beginning of the movie it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made he has gone in the opposite way he had a type of move that he wanted to make and wrote a story to suite it and he has failed in it very badly i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort in the credit of the director he knows the media that he is working with what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie and the actors also have given a decent performance 
wow this one sucks i m gonna sum it up as quickly as possible   br br a count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle a bunch of nothing happens for a long time some lame and un erotic soft core sex scenes happen some girls get their heads cut off the end br br the only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue and a few brief nudie shots and believe me those things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of tedium that this film is in fact the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits and again this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage as everyone else has noted the title of the film is completely nonsensical as there s absolutely no bloodsucking nor dancing of any sort in the film at all it may as well have been called the goat raper leads the circle jerk and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film an accurate title would have been 90 minutes of torture another alluring title that would have at least been truthful for the viewer honestly the trailer that s on the disc shows all the best parts so i highly suggest watching that instead if you re still curious  i can t imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf 2 10 
it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it i found it foul and vulgar i haven t said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill the humor is sophomoric and crude i am not a politically correct person and even i found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive the main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see 
killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor you either love it or hate it i personally like it but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone the tomatoes aren t the same jokes are lame even the actors aren t as funny because that s the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be funny br br so now following the plot made to laugh is annoying they really shouldn t have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy 
wow the plot for this film is all over the place there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin and as a result none of it seemed particularly believable br br the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town she s had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway when a big time actor arrives in town she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost but her husband is worried about shenanigans as this actor is a cad so the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actor and the actor dies as a result he s convicted of first degree murder not manslaughter but murder 1 now pregnant and in need of funds kay goes to new york but broadway jobs aren t to be found so she s forced to take any job even burlesque unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise however eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy but the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play despondent she makes her way to england and becomes a real star years later she returns to new york to get her kid but the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother at the same time her husband s lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10 000 he can get the man out of prison as another reviewer wrote is this to bribe people how can 10 000 get him out otherwise maybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up wow this is enough for 2 or 3 films and all this occurs by the 45 minute mark believe it or not there s quite a bit more to it if you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds br br this is sort of like kitchen sink writing throwing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms francis best efforts it s the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2nd rate plot it s almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie overall unless you are a die hard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s this one is one you can easily skip not terrible but certainly not good br br by the way the child who plays francis daughter upon her return to new york really was terrible i think she was supposed to be i think 
yes indeed it could have been a good movie a love biangle an interesting story unfortunately badly told the image is sometimes weird sometimes ok the picture looks crowded and narrow sighted the sound needs more attention the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action about the acting sorry but the best actress is the landlady the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer the acting is poetical when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetical it s a picture for adults told by the children bother only if extremely curious 
i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard and in addition to them charles butterworth was in this film so why didn t i particularly enjoy it well despite a good cast this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd a pictures i have ever seen given the talent and money spent to make this film it is shocking how slip shod the writing was i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next and i was always right and this isn t because i am some sort of movie savant but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it in fact it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together also i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet true to convention she came running to him in the end uggh there is more suspense in a lassie film br br despite the very very tired and clichéd script there were a few positives about the film it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn t eaten shaved or slept in days also charles butterworth s prattle did provide a few mildly humorous moments but all this just wasn t enough to make this film look any different than a b movie it s a shame it could have been so much better 
look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie connery fishburne capshaw harris underwood beatty thigpen even cameos by slezak lange and plimpton they prove in spades the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standards it s not particularly original and the twists are downright cruel 
that s what i found myself saying time after time in the remarkably inept 3rd act of this sorry excuse for a film first off the computer effects are absolutely mind blowing those computer wizs really deserve a pat on the back the rest of the movie though br br none of the characters act in a realistic manner especially in the aforementioned despicable 3rd act a lot of laughs in the film come unintentionally like when they try to explain that an invisible man s eyelids don t work please give the viewers more credit than that br br some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting what would you do after all if you were invisible no one could catch you these issues were dealt much more intelligently in the classic the invisible man from 1933 there is one scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous and is not mentioned once later on if more attention had been paid it kevin bacon s mad scientist might have made a little more sense br br the movie would actually be much more successful as a porno since the premise could actually be carried out in a unique and interesting manner but this piece of work go see something else or don t and live with the consequences br br 3 10
sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale you begin to really ask yourself what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low can they honestly expect that we ll endure this many clichés and still be entertained br br of course it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in films character needs a gun gets a gun can t do that because he has a gun puts his gun down first oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun he waves it around acting more malicious than real human beings ever do he pushes it in someone s face for 90 minutes shouting questions the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens br br it s a real challenge to make such a tired hackneyed formula work again a film has to be very clever and well executed this one is neither it has no life and no personality and it will suck these components from you it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that so yes i ll say it i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen anyone who was involved in the making of this sub mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they ve done to us all 
if you are planning to see this movie please reconsider i don t usually post my comments about something i ve seen on television but this one was such a waste of my life that i needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it i will just simply say please do not ever see this movie it was a complete waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things utterly inept or working for the company that produced it again i guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie 
i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema so after watching the trailer for water lilies i expected to like this film because i thought i d stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love sort of a female version of beautiful thing br br the main characters are young french women 15 years old marie is slender reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way floriane is outgoing athletic and beautiful and anne is loyal pudgy and behaviorally immature the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie if not at the surface then just below it br br water lilies however is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens it is about sexual frustration suffering ennui teens working at cross purposes and in at least two instances joyless mechanical sex it also proves that screenwriters and film makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative br br in the extra features on the lord of the flies dvd director peter brook says french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism part of the downfall of this film is film maker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism br br where is the joy i asked myself while watching this film yes first love can be painful and frustrating but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh life affirming way these positive aspects are missing from this movie there is no balance br br organically this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film first what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema as evidenced by films like the slingshot the rascals the devil probably the little thief murmur of the heart friends beau pere and europa europa but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion see audience i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would ve been an honest way to go br br there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie it is film maker sciamma cynically manipulating her audience br br perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she s about to request something that is not normal marie understandably asks who cares about being normal then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie because floriane s request is a phony derivative and substitute question not the authentic heartfelt question the movie marie s character and the viewers who ve invested their time deserve br br here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer s nerves 1 since when do the french of all people take baths wearing bathing suits and with a turtle to boot 2 what teen of any nationality would chomp down on an apple core that s been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved s mouth br br the three main actresses are promising and if they find better vehicles for their talents may become excellent actors louise blachere is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles adele haenel could become a leading lady or a bombshell or both pauline acquart possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable in the future she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim br br all in all water lilies was very disappointing will an honest film maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love no not necessarily for the sake of this middle aged guy but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with and yes to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema 
this film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and a funeral in fact if they d called it sex at a funeral they might have done better at the box office br br but the film falls between two stools and can t get up the characters spout improbably bright dialog but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human one arbitrary senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise br br andie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton as of all things a police detective ms staunton seems unable to make a false move would that we could say the same about the writer director br br if notting hill annoyed you as being bogus stay away from this one phonus bolognus on the half shell 
what made the original killer tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no budget who were just being wacky for a couple of days br br this was something with a budget but it just wasn t as much fun john astin of adams family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic but he is supported by lame actors cheap special effects and unfunny gags br br the plot dr gangrene escapes from a french prison and decides he is going to put a pretender on the throne of france the hero his french girlfriend and the gizmo like fuzzy tomato decide they are going to stop him br br forgettable direct to video nonsense 
i was required to watch the movie for my work so i didn t pay for it but i still found the movie to suck far more than average the jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the first wives club division of women s ages in hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely plagiarized beavis butthead do america all in all a bland piece of crap 
i can t believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdb br br this disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed planet earth lite now i knew going into this that it was advertised as from the people who brought you planet earth but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini series i just paid 8 75 to see something i already own on dvd shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here br br but the biggest crime of all is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe after the male polar bear s demise they show his cubs grown significantly a year later and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured no warning of trouble for future generations if we don t get our act together nothing just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie br br i have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life 
i found this to be an utter waste of time effort and money i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making straight to video films but rehashing the plot of the original film with a new perspective is an all time low soon they ll just be re releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a new version of the movie we all love nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original lion king embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happened as they see it br br of course timon is now the hero of the story yadda yadda yadda blah blah blah br br the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature but then again when was the last time you remember matthew broderick whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance overall if you liked the original you ll hate this it s insulting because it s unfair to children and adults alike and that about sums it up 
nicholas walker is paul the local town reverand who s married to martha but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair veronica however in so doing he gets a bout of amnesia sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of misery type of way it s sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator in a film billed as a black comedy one has to bring both elements into said movie while this does bring the former in spades it sadly contains none of the latter furthermore you can t emphasize with any of the characters and as thus have absolutely no vested interest in them technically not an all together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one br br eye candy dara tomanovich gets topless sally kirkland also shows some skin br br my grade c br br where i saw it showtime showcase
finally i thought someone is going to do justice to h g wells s classic not another version set in the wrong locale or era but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely and that is the only plus to this mess br br this is 180 min s long the book is only around 150 pages br br if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life br br i paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa do not make the same mistake as me 
the french film extension du domaine de la lutte directed by iconoclast film maker philippe harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer michel houellebecq he has also worked on this film s scenario according to british cinema magazine sight and sound it is also known as whatever this film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for french cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers the film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character this makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read the basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall beware some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists 
i heard about this film and knew it wasn t real good but i started watching the film and was interested this could be a really great darkly black satire on todays morals in media the small featurettes on every contestent were good it build up to something i wouldn t wanna miss but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible cheap and rather silly here s where the writer should have added something that would make people think but instead it s wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb br br the ending is so bad i give it a 1 even if the film starts of promising 
there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned one either likes it very much applauding its sincerity its liberal point of view and fine acting or else loathes its obvious propaganda mediocre dialogue cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness i fall very much in the latter category and found the film and play concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartime a crushing bore worthwhile mostly for the acting and even then only intermittently that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant her plays were written for people who shared her point of view and she seldom explored ideas that weren t already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the other side is even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say as in rhine i still can t stand the way she says it her characters are unreal and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality she really had nothing new to say i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthy s long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days i urge a peek at watch on the rhine as bad in its way as angels in america which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago 
the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one that is aside from the musical perspective it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don t exactly sit well next to the songs br br aside from the poor premise the acting isn t the best either goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast overall a disappointment br br 3 10
 spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that  lucius shepard br br the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire film br br the film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his children br br all these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long time br br the film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and self discovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebrated br br spielberg s film however re frames walker s story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs br br this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are over sexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words it s the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv it s all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy br br of course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walker s novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin br br beyond walker s hate letter to black men and spielberg s bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielberg s camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams br br problematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film aren t portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children alone br br and so there s a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didn t respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you won t run afoul of the dominant white culture br br 3 10 a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless 
i can t believe that those praising this movie herein aren t thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script makes for a film that s also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when you ve got a sow s ear to work with you can t make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie he s been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter b s amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn 
swing is an important film because it s one of the remaining black produced and acted films from the 1930s many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable but this one is in fairly good shape it s also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old cotton club a time all but forgotten today br br unfortunately while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances it s also a mess the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the era including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day however the writing is just god awful and a bit trashy at times and projects images of black america that some might find a bit demeaning this is because before the plot really gets going you are treated to a no account bum who lives off his hard working wife and when he is caught with a hussy they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown and the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor a trashy scene indeed later in the film when the prima donna is behaving abominably her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him it seems like the film at times wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus they can t even do this well with some of the worst acting i ve seen in a very long time br br still if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture just don t say i didn t warn you about the acting it s really really bad 
cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less vanessa redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love br br this is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is not bad as such but with redgrave toni collette glenn close meryl streep clare danes natasha richardson eileen atkins patrick wilson hugh darcy and others you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance br br wait for cable 
having seen three other versions of the same film i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest primarily due to scott s rather dull and leaden performance his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better when scrooge was at his meanest you don t get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version even the musical version take on this are better executed very disappointing 
seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie and so i sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief beside ed harris no one seems to own the skills of acting even sean connery who i normally worship must have had an off day during the entire filming of just case not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me br br this made this movie look cheap and unreal br br the story makes up a little it is thrilling and the plot is unexpected br br conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do 
i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot a mind bogglingly tedious pointless muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored looking peter falk the plot such as it is just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with one part of the proceedings which i found extremely puzzling was peter falk s character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as lt columbo if the producers insist on keeping columbo s first name a secret why couldn t they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous like i said this is the pits and all true columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague 
really bad movie the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement br br this vampire s hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far derek bliss travels to mexico in search for some blood suckers he use some interesting weapons and is part of some van helsig vampire s hunters net ok but he work alone he s assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight directed by john carpenter and starred by james woods derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends sancho a teenager without experience father rodrigo a catholic priest zoey a particular vampire and ray collins another expert vampire hunter so obviously in this adventure he isn t alone br br you can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to james woods and then if you watch the film you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories totally predictable with terrible acting performances really bad special effects and incoherent events br br i deeply recommend not to see this film rent another movie see another channel go out with your friends etc br br 3 10
the cliché of the shell shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment pity a splendid cast acting to the limits of their high talents can t redeem the return of the soldier from its stiff collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement best moments as another reviewer noted come when glenda jackson is on screen but even jackson s crackling good cinematic power can t pull this film s chestnuts from its cold never warmed hearth ann margret she of sex kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here despite her speaking with a nigh flawless middlesex accent the hackneyed score redolent of many lackluster tv miniseries slathered on saccharine emotionalism is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script blocking and overbaked formalism of the direction except for its score and corseted script and direction the return of the soldier has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together 
when i bought this dvd i though it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards let s give it a chance i was totally wrong what a disappointing movie first it s not a comedy it s a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it s even worse than many portuguese soap operas second the plot is so boring and leads nowhere it has no structure it just flows like the wind in one or another direction the production is also bad the sound mixing is horrible because sometimes the voices are disconnected it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the 80 s the acting should have been better too well to sum up it s not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve in fact it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years bad argument bad acting bad production i had no high hopes for this movie but it was much worse than i ve ever imagined just forget about it 
this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of hamlet to ever reach the screen branagh s approach to the material can only be described as vulgar going to such lengths as depicting ophelia in a straight jacket having fortinbras army appear suddenly on the horizon when the palace is apparently guarded only by francisco and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of jimmy cagney s bottom and mary pickford s kate br br branagh chose to set his film in an edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed and branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of hamlet and olphelia s relationship treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window br br the uncut text does allow branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime more footage of kenneth branagh this is never so apparent as in the how all occasions inform against me speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of gone with the wind s i ll never be hungry again this may serve branagh s ego but it does not serve shakespeare or the speech when i saw the film in the theater i leaned over to my companion and snickered great moments with mr hamlet branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last when he attempts to out do the olivier film and its justly celebrated death of claudius by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch impaling him with a sword branagh s dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through claudius heart with a super hero s bulls eye the only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off the wall funny br br while this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy it is in fact nothing but a star studded display of a once talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism the emperor has no clothes and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man s ego out of control 
i am curious is really two films in one half of it is the sexual experimental side of lena and the other half is her curiosity with political socialism whatever the director s intention the two don t really mesh together the director should have just stuck with the romantic side of lena and made a separate movie for the politics there is a bizarre mixture of political war rallies dr king serious political interviews flopping breasts and pubic hair the film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie other than the interesting sex scenes you ll be bored dry watching this film unlike many other reviewers i think the nude sexual scenes are overdone for what it is if you want to see real porn i m sure there are better choices the pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is i think the cast did a fine job however they played their parts believably there is little of the over the topness i m so used to seeing in the american films during this time 
i saw this movie once a long time ago and i have no desire to ever see it again br br this movie is about preston waters a hard lucked preteen who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems to be short on cash all this changes when a bank robber runs over preston s bike and passes him a blank check as compensation preston uses the check to withdraw 1 million from the bank preston then buys a mansion and says that he s working as the assistant of a mysterious and wealthy backer named mr macintosh after that he just goes crazy with the money br br on paper this sounds like a great idea however on screen it is one of the emptiest movies i ve ever seen for one thing it s too unbelievable i know some parts of the movie were meant to be incredible but i draw the line at a twelve year old boy going out with a thirty year old woman and being put in charge of a imaginary person s small fortune also this was a shallow movie with weak acting a predictable plot line and characters who are less than memorable the characters were either cheesy over the top annoying or underdeveloped but juice was a funny character br br if you re looking for a good movie to watch with your family skip this one 
the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies ri chard is great he really put on a top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile i can t say anything bad about peter galleghar he s one of my favorite actors i love anne rice i m currently reading the vampire chronicles but i m glad i saw the movie before reading the book this is a little too real for me i prefer lestat and louis s witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry but it s just not my type of show 
i really don t understand all these positive user reviews this movie is the worst movie i ve ever seen and i m not trying to be pessimistic br br eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film but i don t think it is her own fault but the directors he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting the idea the make up everything br br the star i m giving is only for the idea behind the movie which was very bad executed br br don t watch this bullshit go watch a fellini woody allen or some david lynch 
i love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real the special effects of this movie are very good i have seen most of this movie since it s been airing on hbo for the past couple of months i must admit i may have missed a few scenes but i m usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once but every time i see some of hollow man i feel depressed almost like a film noir i m not sure why perhaps it s that i don t want kevin bacon to be evil and there s disappointment in that but i think it s witnessing just how relentlessly evil he becomes regardless i can recommend this movie for excitement but i do not recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 
 to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century br br a river runs through it certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand point great landscapes redford acting well br br unfortunately the story is bad br br i felt sorry for the narrator author who is as dry narrow minded a character as his father a preacher being driven not driving his own life he is left to watch his brother who is also caged in the small town environment losing his life the author never even comes close to undestand his brother s motivations but at least realizes that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour fun all there is is fly fishing where he follows even as an old man the style of his father br br the end is not surprising it is forseeable from the very beginning br br definitely not a must see br br 
what has ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way this movie begins like a primer for film students on irish cinematic cliches unctuous priests spitting before handshakes town square cattle marts cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music quickly however it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big daddy o of irish cliches religous strife it concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her catholic fathered child is educated which would seem like a reasonable enough wish though not to the 50 s county wexford villagers she has to live with rather than send them to a catholic school she decides to up and leave for belfast then scotland where a few more cliches are reguritated while she s there her father and family back home are subjected to a boycott which turns very nasty i m not going to give away the ending not because i think people should go see this movie but because it s not very interesting one of the problems with the film is the central character we re supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life the villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it in addition it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current northern ireland peace process the woman is told by her lawyer that she must lay down preconditions for her return the film is allegedly based on a true story but it s themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches in the past 
i m in iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies we also have access to plenty of pirated movies this gem came along with 11 other movies and this is easily the worst i ve seen in a long time i ve seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn t take itself too seriously but really i think that s a cover up for the fact that its horrible it s not tongue in cheek the writers really thought they were improving on the movie blade this movie is just one notch above vampire assassin which if you haven t seen i recommend at least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you ll laugh harder than you thought possible this is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever from the bad acting to cliché visual to the adobe premier special effects they couldn t even get blanks for the guns which may have to do with where the movie was filmed but if you re going to use effects make them close to accurate as for the cast it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out once again like ron hall in vampire assassin don t let stunt folk act they can t also the comment about this being a return of old vampire movies no it s not this is exactly what all new vampire movies are about buffy the vampire slayer blade underworld they re all about some super star fighting the vampires this is the newest vampire genre with bad blood fake screams and cheesy over acting obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie or friends of the cast but what do i care i paid 33 cents for it anyway to wrap this up someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie i give them credit because it s better than i could do of course i also know i can t make movies so i don t try i do know how to watch movies though i work 12 hour nights 6 days a week i ve seen several thousand in the year i ve been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar attack 
i m a big fan of the tv series largo winch this movie was pain for me i had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep it was boring how can somebody ruin this title so much the story was the only good thing actors were sh t they can t live the role the main actor is a null watch the other roles of this actor the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable somehow they were not to follow the situation like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title french can t do right thing with big films like alien 4 that was bit brrr after alien 1 2 3 
i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered through br br the person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line just one scene that is even worth a chuckle br br she is a much better singer than i remember her to be but i didn t want to watch a lounge act br br i think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don t view it objectively 
 spoilers  spoilers are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality it awfully seems so first of all this is a noble premise that could ve been utilized well a rejected young nerd who grows up stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high can t say you had nothing to work with but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike we know the pattern by now these stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute let me ask you something who in their right mind is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she s all alone and surrounded by corpses does that make any damn sense at all br br valentine is only occasionally innovative one good shot involves the butchering of denise richards character she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw there s some good songs in the soundtrack including one cool track by orgy the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvd br br even the acting is mediocre at best the actors all sleep through their roles of course david boreanaz is often stoic even in his portrayal as the title character on angel denise richards is a fine actress though and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie br br valentine is just like you d expect pretentious implausible forgettable cheesy and without a good scare in sight don t even bother br br my score 4 
i give this film it s props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted but i couldn t get past the implausibility of the whole thing br br first and foremost a game built around the notion of russian roulette that has to fill on hour the big problem is that if you are doing a live show you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the real bullet then what do you do you have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show the corollary is that okay you get to the end and the first five contestants survive which means number six has the bullet and can t possibly get the payout he isn t going to shoot himself at that point so it s kind of anti climatic br br second problem almost as big human nature people are going to flinch panic soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television too much randomness that s why real reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited br br  br br we are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 am in the morning with the token asian girl announcing each boost in ratings br br a point on race and sex big surprise the movies two minority and two female contestants are the ones who survive so we are left with the two white males and of course the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it the purpose of such a show would be it s randomness but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies br br the climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide the eva mendes character actually grows a conscience when someone dies what did she think was going to happen she is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing and the show went on to be a big hit really br br the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous this is neither 
i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic private lessons which portrays the dream of any male teenager br br private lessons ii has nothing to do with the title i mention it s just a regular soft core cinemax flick that won t make a change in your life there s just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that s it i watched this a long time ago but believe me this is just a regular boring soft core flick br br the women are hot but that s not enough to rent or buy the movie my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable 
what was with all the turkish actors no offense but i thought it was all for nothing for all these actors the film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability it demanded next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him the script was so bad their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn t even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional br br even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish it was really weird and they didn t sound like real guns a video game had better sound effects than this film there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like lets get the f k out of here and what are we going to do man he sounded like a girl as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too for a few seconds whoo hoo dumb film poor madsen he will bounce back 
the story by norman maclean is a masterwork redford s film is a mediocrity he adds banal scenes of the maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story the cipher brad pitt trying to play the charismatic paul maclean a genius outdoors proves either risible or depressing depending on what the original story meant to you some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful also tom skerritt as the father and craig sheffer as norman are strong and masculine as men were once expected to be none of the women make an impression in the film which is regrettable because maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear even poetic 
two years before he wrote and directed arthur steve gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for henry winkler then tv s the fonz a 1950s college thespian woos a co ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon to make ends meet he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling eventually becoming a gorgeous george like celebrity turning likable winkler into an obnoxious goof off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time but the jokes and situations are often wrong headed and mean staged rather sloppily by director carl reiner particularly crude is a wincing bit involving hervé villechaize putting the moves on polly holliday as henry s beloved kim darby looks a little out of her element particularly when surrounded by all these tv hams rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential 1 2 from  
as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree seriously you just have to wonder why this movie was made if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars 
i loved the apprentice for the first two seasons br br but now with season 5 things are getting just plain too tiring br br i used to like the show but its become donald trumps own ego fest granted its his company you ll be working for but come on some of the things says you re fired is just insulting br br after watching the show i would not want to work for him not because he is arrogant pompous or such its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm good entertainment yes but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring its not team work its not personal its just business watch your back jack 
this is definitely the worst movie adam s ever done but at this point in his life he was just happy to have a movie there are 3 or 4 laughs in it but i used the fast forward button through some of it don t waste your time i only saw it because i wanted to see all of his movies but it sucked 
blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties the plot is completely pointless its overtones of lonliness are pathetic do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film like buying a mansion for a mere 300 grand the notion let alone the bargain basement price will only be believed by the most gullible viewers please respect your intelligence and don t watch this awful awful film 
i guess i was attracted to this film both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor so i gave it a chance from director gregor jordan basically ned kelly is set up by the police especially superintendent francis hare he is forced to go on the run forming a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family s names that s really all i can say about the story as i wasn t paying the fullest attention to be honest also starring orlando bloom as joseph byrne naomi watts as julia cook laurence kinlan as dan kelly philip barantini as steve hart joel edgerton as aaron sherritt kiri paramore as constable fitzpatrick kerry condon as kate kelly emily browning as grace kelly and rachel griffiths as susan scott ledger makes a pretty good performance for what it s worth and the film does have it s eye catching moments particularly with a gun battle towards the end but i can t say i enjoyed it as i didn t look at it all okay 
i thought it was a new york located movie wrong it s a little british countryside setting br br i thought it was a comedy wrong it s a drama  well up to the last third because after the story becomes totally abracadabrantesque the symbolic word for a french presidential mandate it means close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling br br what do i have left maybe a good duo of actress yes i know they are 3 friends but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me the tall doctoress surprises by her punch and mcdowell delivers a fine acting as usual all in delicate soft and almost mute attitude this gentleness puzzles me because as other fine artists or directors the same pattern is repeating over and over in her case it s like whatever the movie it s always the same character defined by her feelings her values who lives infinite different stories i still don t know how to set the limit between the artists and the works br br another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch the interesting different points of view the women have each their own way of living even if they are all single it brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people br br finally the movie is quite viewable but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision 
this movie is so aggrivating the main character looks like he s 35 and i ve seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor br br also some of the worst dialogue i ve heard in 3 years lets go find a small animal to torture br br ugh  i can t even continue don t watch this pile of garbage it was made in 8 days br br the one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures br br 2 out of 10 unwatchable
when i first saw the trailer for prom night i have to admit the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people there was no tension the characters how was i supposed to care about them they had no development what so ever the killer oh my god this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed i know it s a film but why would a man who never killed any one before kill a girl s family and friends that he s just obsessed over i mean was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her i have no idea because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror br br donna s family was just brutally murdered by her teacher who has become very obsessed over her he was captured and put in jail it s been 3 years and she s just now getting some peace in her life she s even going to her senior prom but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends and the hotel maid and the bell boy because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee s are donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un noticed and can kill people so silently just wow br br i m sorry i really did want to love this movie we haven t had a good slasher flick in a long time but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious i know that this was a pg 13 movie but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes not to mention no stab holes i wouldn t recommend this movie for anyone unless you re a teen this movie was made for the teenagers not adults and not for those who know a real horror movie no offense to those who did enjoy this film but i don t understand how anyone could br br 2 10
i was so disgusted by this film i felt obligated to warn off others this film has no story plot or hint of purpose the film starts after the standard lets be scary movie intro which by now every film watcher has become accustomed so we can ignore the beginning completely we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static acting is a disgrace and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came having said that even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster senseless violence and what i can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up eccentric writer who probably considers himself to be an artist has resulted in a film which will test your patience it was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said we have been watching this for 45 mins did i realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn t the audience rather than suggest what the film is missing let me tell you what it has dumb blonde victims bad monster guy thing about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours days weeks months and credits br br want a silver lining well the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film 
this is really terrible br br the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched i would have a suitable reply br br i think it is filmed on 35 mm so it is already tacky like hell i wouldn t have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboys had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix let me debunk the myths and lies br br there is nothing good in the movie everything yells tacky the actress is ugly the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn t hurt a kitten obviously the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie br br i know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before unforgivable 
i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators to me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main character s internal turmoil does not work at all credibility is often overstretched too many questions are left open did i miss some central points or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots br br a boy called campbell jr grows up in upstate new york at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it the boy leafs through the book his dad doesn t like his doing that what should this tell me the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin bang it is 1938 the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright what kind of plays does he write in what language is he successful his wife is an actress and looks glamorous the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same he does not why because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american because he is successful because his wife is because he likes his life there because he likes the nazis because he is just plain lazy and doesn t like change don t ask me br br possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist he states that he is deeply in love with his wife he speaks of his republic of two there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a republic of one br br on the request of an american agent campbell jr agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast br br so now we have campbell jr presenting himself over the air as the last free american the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting although one wonders what happened when campbell jr really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc anyway the nazis lose the wife dies campbell jr says he goes to the russian front but does not go is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug is dragged to a sight seeing tour in auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york br br and this is where the story really starts br br bang from now on it is like a short story by paul auster it is 1961 campbell jr lives in new york tenement as a has been and mourns the loss of his wife nobody really cares or do they yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction auschwitz survivors a painter some american supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead they even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife anyway in the end campbell jr calls in at the israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann s he writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriter s ribbons without getting sooty the least bit br br while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american i assume according to them this took a lot of courage as a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win win situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story br br one might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything but even then it fails to make a point primarily i suspect because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat this is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts but i guess this is largely unfilmable maybe i should give the book a chance 
wow what a waste of acting talent my husband and i sat there both thinking this has to get better these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap unattractive characters hackneyed script and listless pacing make for a long two hours i actually couldn t hack it and left to do the grocery shopping the husband stayed and confirmed that it didn t get better by the time buddy is killed you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives it would be infinitely more entertaining beautiful scenery and costumes can t keep this one alive 
this review may contain some spoilers br br just when you thought they didn t make them so extremely bad anymore along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor it s even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of starlight a film that should only be viewed for laughs br br chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining half breed part man and part alien apparently the earth is in dire straits something is wrong with the genetics of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland only by duplicating the dna of the half breed can the kindly alien race save the planet don t ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution which is caused by humans you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures not saving them anyway the half breed turns out to be billy wirth a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mother s line despite the fact that his mother is a red headed caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson wasn t this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic carmen electra bomb the chosen one such a howler chong arrives in her ship just as wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend before you can say utter the word hogwash chong is revealing her secret to wirth who isn t surprised for a moment and spreading the word to wirth s family chong also makes pals with wirth s mother who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years well this is because wirth s father was an alien that abandoned her of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for wirth so he can use wirth s dna to make the people of earth his slaves his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most br br the ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien but the effects are the bane of the movie the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship communicating with her superior someone who we do not see but that chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light they use no spoken words but telepathy so we are treated to subtitles trouble is both chong and her superior s subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually speaking at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film now i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me the most offensive was the most simple one a fake night sky the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades and we get a shot of the seven stars thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus and the cluster doesn t take up much room in the sky at all these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and  oh it has to be seen to be believed br br starlight star bright last star i see tonight i wish i might i wish i may not have to watch any more of this trash today br br zantara s score 1 out of 10 
ok if you re looking for another bastketball diaries this is completely the wrong film br br i revolves around two brothers max the younger has a major cocaine addiction adam the eldest is a doctor this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible it however does not it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways eventually adam can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well br br this movie has almost no climax doesn t descend into what cocaine really does to you has boring and low budget scenes and the acting of the eldest brother adam is horrific br br i have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards it is not a heart wencher if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs rent if not buy the basketball diaries and notice the difference br br try to avoid this movie but if you think you will enjoy try and see for yourself 
the characters are cliched and predictable with everyone being either snow white pure or wholly evil the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing over the top way it s doubly disappointing if you re a bette davis fan because her character is not a typically fun bette davis type character she just gets to frown pensively a lot br br on the whole neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting moving or enjoyable at all 
having loved paris je t aime i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons br br although i was not expecting a re make of paris in new york i was expecting the same structure what i liked about paris was the breakup of the neighborhoods you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell in ny there is no clear separation of the stories at different points in the film characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on also the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow br br another thing i loved about the paris film was the different takes on love it wasn t all romantic there was love between parents and their children unrequited love a lonely middle aged woman yearning for love etc it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans ny seemed to only go for an edgy over the top sexuality there were some redeemable shorts but overall the ny film didn t evoke any emotion for me i didn t connect with any of the characters like i did with paris i remember watching paris and feeling a deep sadness loneliness yearning hopefulness wonder it just had so much soul for me there was no soul in the ny film br br maybe if i had gone into it without having paris looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response but as a self titled re take of paris je t aime i was sorely disappointed 
brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature particularly the nature of addiction which still resonate strongly today br br as for the movie eh nothing special the cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and circling around everything making the viewer quite nauseous why the director didn t put a stop to this is beyond me but maybe he was too busy trying and somehow failing to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately cast actors all in all a weak adaptation your three hours would be better spent reading the book 
mere thoughts of going overboard make me want to weep throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie it s not even a supposed so bad it s good movie i would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can t see it oh the pain the pain 
this is an anthology horror film it s made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didn t think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all it would have been better to do it as a comedy like comedy of terrors only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way and it s probably the best of them i ve seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis tales from the crypt the anthology style works well for the producers because it means that they can hire a bunch of big name actors employ them for only one week of shooting or so and then bring in the next big name so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee but that s very unfortunate for the audience because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt actually acting together instead they re stuck in these vignettes by themselves so let s take them one at a time briefly br br the first story has denholm elliot who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character unfortunately the actor who plays dominic the source of the horror tom adams just looks silly which ruins any possible horror there s some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though like the scene where dominic kills elliot s psychiatrist it s the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching so the whole audience is supposed to shout out look out behind you the second story is the one with peter cushing god i love that man so much too bad so many of his films like this one pretty much stink in the story he s supposed to be pining away for a long lost love and he sees her likeness in a wax museum it s a completely predictable story that goes nowhere br br then you have the bit with christopher lee where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs but instead we re supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil the actress chloe franks was pretty good in that type of bad seed role though br br the last story is kind of amusing ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire that s about all the story has to offer i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitt s english is i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films i ve seen her in br br not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists 
absolute garbage the reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula but because the plot was just pathetic br br the supposed star didn t do anything to solve the case and neither did anyone else really it was just routine police work utterly tedious br br you sat right till the end hoping for a twist and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment br br there was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap could the lt s personal involvement finally cloud his judgement br br all the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it but surely a genius like lt c by constant conversation with the wronged husband would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride hides the body and then plants subtle clues it could have been good it was a complete waste of time 
daphne zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher and the light fades quickly if not her than what other reason to watch this five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting and the group are short a few people then a killer is on the loose i honestly wanted to say i was going to enjoy this one it had a fair set up or maybe that was just daphne zuniga in it the film is too slow and almost as silent as a library most of the acting is below average and the point of view moments are so old news acclaimed composer christopher young of such films as hellraiser and entrapment scored this in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a tv movie still it seems higher than the movie deserves so other than young and zuniga this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel 
this is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get noticed that is it the dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the sex scenes is absolutely absent the acting and the dialog are more suited for high school children yet the subject is intended for adult audiences it is a gutless and shallow movie it could have been way better if it had a story and more drama ah and on top of that one more thing why are inner monologues so excessively used makes it seem so cheap all in all an embarrassing movie for romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view it i know the means are scarce but that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one does and please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians they can t act 
this starts off bad what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best man story and then it gets worse  spoiler alert  what with andie s character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch from hell girlfriend and then from there it s basically unwatchable claptrap she forgives her friend and has the organ player s love child and the 3 women end up as they started drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah andie s character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth have mercy 
i saw this when it was in the theater it started out so strong i mean back in 1980 this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time now you would have to of been at least 30 or so in 1980 to really understand this point because studying film historically misses the mind set at the time the expectations and other related psychological factors now as i said the movie was engaging suspenseful and very entertaining it builds to an excellent climax then  it ends i mean the person that described it as having a water balloon break in your hand before throwing it besides being a very poetic description in my experience it was just not strong enough my wife and i were well how can i say this we were upset i mean we paid money invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent we both felt we were robbed with an ending that convinced us both the production company must of run out of money and could not raise enough to finish it correctly in fact my wife said it best it did not end it just stopped 
i saw this film at the london premiere and i have to say i didn t expect much but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining br br the original basic instinct was no great film and is still something of a smut classic but it was entertaining i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it br br however this lame brain waaay belated sequel has nothing is sharon stone still gorgeous well let s put it this way for a 47 year old she s pretty hot is she as beautiful as she was in the original no she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing she doesn t look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress and whatnot br br the rest of the performances range from bad to terrible and michael caton jones has officially delivered his first true turkey a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious br br i hear the film went through multiple editing sessions and it s very clear from the start nothing makes much sense the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending oh my talk about stupid and unbelievable i saw gigli i saw son of the mask  and although i m not looking to smear this film i can say with my own authority that i prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure br br by the way stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy type nightclub br br basic instinct 2  basically it stinks too 
shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better almost to the point of being original bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story but the film already surpasses many in the yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks genre because it is actually shot in the south br br a group of college girls head to ft lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road sue ellen has to pee so she heads into the woods when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff strangle his mistress to death this is the point where the story not the movie actually comes close to being good br br while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i ve seen since walton goggins in house of 1000 corpses br br a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her br br and in the strangest scene sheriff dean makes like he s about to rape patty and tells her to take off her clothes dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he s about to do the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ i feel sorry for this preacher s flock jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven 
this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture trys to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling br br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don t expect a story there isn t one 
i watched cabin by the lake this afternoon on usa considering this movie was made for tv is was interesting enough to watch the sequel so i tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed i knew i wouldn t like the movie but i was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of dv the movie would have been tolerable if it wasn t for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere i expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots but there seemed to be no logical explanation the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing but infomercials at 4 o clock in the morning 
well where to begin i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed call me ignorant for not knowing of schneebaum s book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock but don t blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to said book yeah i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a modern cannibal tale i mean am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes i certainly didn t expect an hour and forty five minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life i certainly didn t expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at tobias schneebaum and all of his off putting glory br br schneebaum is indeed unlikable the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isn t even that interesting a character to fill a story oh really he was a cannibal ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaum s dirty past the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had a small piece that s it folks ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches it s like calling a movie the life of a true don juan only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played just the tip unbelievable br br the directing is indeed superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told alright i understand that i didn t read schneebaum s volume before watching his celluloid tale of it but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next he s going on and on about how he can t drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life i mean jesus can you at least slam his back story to the first part follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru also i don t particularly care much for schneebaum s insipid little quips on life and living but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i don t expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later absurd br br another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels br br the bottom line here is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud pure and simple i know that i haven t read the book but i m still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaum s work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably un riveting if you re looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism turn away because keep the river to your right is an embarrassingly hilarious self serving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straight jacket and a gag 
this was disappointing it started well enough but as it went on and lost every opportunity to soar it fell flat maria schrader s acting is dreadful never seeming to mean what she says or even knowing what she says until she says it she showed no genuine emotion at all not for her beloved goy or her mother s story when with lena she seemed to have little more than an academic interest in lena s story there never seemed to be a real relationship between lena and her mother except her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding which isn t much the supposed parallel between hannah s mixed romance and her mother s relationship with her father was as cliché as they come and failed miserably anyway the wedding was completely unconvincing and a dumb finish the climax of the protest was uninspiring and no matter what lena had or had not done to influence the outcome she would surely have shown some complexity of feeling at the time a haunted look an inexplicable ambivalence in fact none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark it was very hard to care about any of them even little ruth everything with luis was a distraction if every reference to him was removed it wouldn t be noticed br br a simple story made confusing by poor character development weak acting and directing that made everyone look like they were acting you could almost hear quiet on the set  i started thinking this was worthy of a 7 but as the film went on it dropped rapidly to a 4 then earning a 3 after the silliness of the wedding scene this was about as cold and sterile a movie as i have seen a terrible waste of a good story 
not sure if i m referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director devil hunter sure is one bizarre horror movie br br the plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like cannibal ferox and cut and run chick gets kidnapped in the jungle by a tribe of savages the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party city style halloween costume renditions of tribal garb and the savages range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp br br to make matters worse this film has ultra minimal gore no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis not fun i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or euro trash film this one just fell way short br br 2 out of 10 kids 
another violent angry fantasy from paul verhoeven verhoeven is a puzzle it s difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion he also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world cannot hide a negligence to story dialogue and performance kevin bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side in an attempt to offset his boyish looks given the material however bacon isn t nearly hateful enough to compel the other principals are elisabeth shue and josh brolin neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who when forced to deliver inane dialogue embarrass themselves the climax is a study in preponderance and disbelief has to be truly suspended 
terrible movie nuff said br br these lines are just filler the movie was bad why i have to expand on that i don t know this is already a waste of my time i just wanted to warn others avoid this movie the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic bad in every way the only nice thing about the movie are deniz akkaya s breasts even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage br br ok now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum first i waste my time watching this offal then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad i think it is totally unnecessary 
slow and riddled with inaccuracy over looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the alamo during the texas fight for independence from mexico james arness as jim bowie brian keith as davy crockett alec baldwin as col travis raul julia as general santa anna this made for tv project also stars david ogden stiers kathleen york and jim metzler very good original music by peter bernstein 
pros akshay kumar s performance some touching scenes in the 2nd half br br cons the whole 1st hour every scene involving rajpal yadav major stupidity in ab s decision making let me get this straight he believes brutally insulting his son s soul in every possible way is a better way for him to make akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth wtf he considers akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father is soon gonna die due to cancer but thinks insulting him will make him stronger am i the only one who doesn t see the logic here easily the movie s biggest flaw br br  akshay becoming a stunt man lmao we re told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in mba but when the time arrives to support himself and his pregnant wife he becomes a stunt man lol how abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field or heck anywhere else where ur life isn t in danger this is some incredibly dumb writing br br  the ending i hate this sort of melodramatic crap everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for ab s character which i couldn t the entire thing reminded me a little too much of srk in khnh this please feel sorry for the guy with the illness crap has run its course i felt more like puking than sympathy for the old man couldn t watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd the whole thing br br bottomline waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie its obvious director vipul shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense give em some decent song picturizations fancy outfits plenty of glycerin filled scenes and some star power and they ll happily lap up crap like this 
i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten before going to this movie the day after it came out i came on imdb to check out the comments a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog i never go by other people s opinions so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie it had to be one of the worst movies i ve ever seen br br the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff since when do scary movies have sappy scenes i swear i m amazed there weren t any group hug  moments br br i think i jumped once and that s because i zoned out thinking about my research paper for english the clichéd birds cat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen br br and the characters were stupid my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said i have to get my mom s shawl  you idiot screw the shawl safety is just a few steps away but no my mom s shawl is wayyyy more important than my health and safety and to top it all off they take her back to her house knowing that the killer knew where she lived god br br my friend and i also predicted the entire movie and not just the i bet he s hiding under the bed moments it was the he stole the bellhop s clothes and sneaked out of the hotel and it s the detective coming down the hallway not the killer moments movies should never be this predictable disney movies aren t even this predictable br br i m gonna complete my rant now by saying this was a terrible movie i m glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldn t buy it for 15 00 and then hate it it was just bad it would ve been better if only one thing would ve happened if after being shot by the detective the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in knife in hand falling and stabbing the girl on his way down oh how lovely that would ve been br br don t waste your time or money go see a good movie 
i m not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is i like bad films as they are often the most entertaining i love bad special effects bad acting bad music and inept direction with the exception of the music this movie had all of those qualities br br the special effects were amazingly bad the worst i ve seen since my nintendo 64 some scenes to watch for include the thunderchild the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot the big ben scene the train wreck wow there are so many bad effects on the plus side though some scenes of the alien walkers are well done br br the acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been having been based directly on h g wells book for having such good source material it s almost as though the actors were trying to be so over the top as to make it funny and then there s the mustache the single most distracting piece of facial hair i ve seen in a long time of course only half the movie contains acting the rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots br br to say that timothy hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors with the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes the bad green screening it s amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie i wouldn t imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie bravo mr hines bravo br br my advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what i did have some friends who enjoy bad movies over drink play poker while watching it keep drinking and maybe you ll make it all the way through it does make for an excellent bad movie so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster 
 in 1955 tobias schneerbaum disappeared in the peruvian amazon one year later he walked out of the jungle naked it took him 45 years to go back supposedly keep the river on your right is a modern cannibal tale in reality anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed the first half of the movie is more like a travel log of new ginuea mostly touting the native art the second half relies on still photos of a peruvian cannibal tribe but really that s about it unless of course you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding or schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers i give up big disappointment and not really a modern cannibal tale  merk
a dedicated fan to the tlk movies with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel disney has produced along comes this film now i m not arguing with animation voice work music but this is no more than a timon pumbaa screwloose in the tlk atmosphere although it isn t bad it doesn t add anything basically this movie is one big joke and that s about all that saves it make a real tlk3 disney the potential is there br br 4 10
i almost called hbo and demanded my money back for the month just because they ve been airing this movie i can just see the movie execs sitting around going okay we need to come up with something that s just like home alone only we ll add a bunch of cash for the kid hire cut rate actors and oh yeah we ll make it a lot less funny br br okay maybe not the last part but that s basically what you ve got here not even worth seeing if someone else rents it and as a movie for kids forget it i wouldn t let my kids see this not necessarily because of bad taste jokes but because i wouldn t want them to say what were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage dad  
this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time awful acting awful script and they were the good points one to definitely miss the jokes if you could call them that were so predictable as to be pathetic pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic i sat willing to give it a chance hoping that it was going to improve which alas it didn t if it was a choice between this and a book i suggest you settle down for a good read i like denise richards which is why i gave this movie a go but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me 
i just finished watching going overboard i have to say that we should send every copy of this film to iraq and make them watch i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min adam sandler could not find a better project than this as for the writing if thats what you want to call it those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was 10 000 and they were way under did wallmart get a good deal on this every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor the only good thing about this movie is you can use the dvd as a coaster or trade it to a friend but then they might not be your friend anymore 
seriously what were they thinking over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie br br main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation also the overall is just totally different and more modernized br br director alan j levi did some other columbo movies in the past which all very much sticked to the usual formula it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie br br the columbo character himself also feels quite different perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also doesn t exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch br br in all honesty the movie doesn t begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses it s such a stupid written kidnap thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really doesn t know to entertain its viewers in any way br br it also doesn t help much that the supporting actors aren t the most talented ones around despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell you br br an odd columbo entry which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula br br 4 10
you may want to know up front that i am not a mormon unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film i mention this so you ll understand that the way i look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith for some being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith and that is not my intention so my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were well after seeing the film i doubt if i have learned much at all since i have been a history teacher i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the teachings of the church but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh darn nice too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal plus you learn practically nothing about the church s beliefs other than they are nice people work hard and some have many wives instead the people are almost cartoon like in their simplistic portrayals joseph smith and brigham young and their followers are angelic the non mormons were all devils and brian donlevy is the trouble maker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy it s all so very simple too simple almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial br br brigham young especially was a very complex man with many good points as well as bad to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly it s also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsley only the facts that led to his being almost super human were emphasized heck now that i think about that this is the trouble with most religious films they often come off as one dimensional trite and bland let s have a full and more complete film of these men one that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals br br now if you can ignore the fact that you won t learn very much about the faith or its second leader the film is enjoyable enough it s obvious someone at 20th century fox really cared about the film as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors up and coming actors and wonderful character actors the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss it just didn t have a lot to tell us other than they were all swell plus there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes a few of the mistakes include young taking over the helm immediately after the death of joseph smith no mention of the various mormon denominations and splinter groups talk of gold in california even though it was 1847 and gold wouldn t be discovered until 1948 as well as no specific mention of polygamy or smith s many wives just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene and no one seemed to care even though it was a very hostile audience don t you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it br br one final comment do not i repeat do not watch this film when it s shown on american movie classics while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message i was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions what i mean is this the film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of pop ups talk about disrespectful and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film by doing this they not only insult the faith but marginalize their market after all who is into hearing about these things and the life of brigham young is this a movie in this form that you can show to your kids or recommend to others 
this is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period with some camera work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s early 70s br br the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art it s interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals 
ok honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great its really not there were two good things that came out of this movie 1 jack s performance he was very good i can tip my hat for him 2 danny s performance he was good no other then that it got pretty stupid and what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy she was so bad she looked the same every time she got scared the problem with this movie was the ending i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently and the over all movie was just stupid the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off 3 10 
a pot boiler if ever i saw one a supposed thriller borrowing from a time to kill silence of the lambs even an inverted in the heat of the night with a little reverse murder a la strangers on a train thrown in it fails abysmally where all the above to a large degree succeeded namely in delivering thrills the plot seems condensed from a bigger book making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving while the direction lacks pace and verve to rein in any kudos a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too connery is clearly slowing down in his old age barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh darn kids of his he even has a father in law who seems younger than him laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you re confused from the outset as to whether he s a bad guy or a good guy someone once said that flashbacks shouldn t lie they do confusedly here the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles the supposed climax managed too to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back not as should have been the aim front edge of my seat mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure 
i was disgusted by this movie no it wasn t because of the graphic sex scenes it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art it shows one piece of art work that she did but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the trial br br i don t know if you understood this from the movie probably not tassi was not a noble character he raped artemisia it was not love it was rape he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia while she states over and over again it s true br br i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about don t base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie i encourage you to do some research artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work br br don t see the movie but find out the true story of artemisia 
my title above says it all let me make it clearer if you have seen the bbc s planet earth which i am sure most of you have then you are not gonna like this movie too much and i own all the discs of planet earth i had seen the rating for this movie very high and read good reviews about it i was excited to check it out br br alas i went to the theater and the movie started i saw it was a disney movie with production companies listing bbc and discovery and when they started the first scenes about the polar bear i recognized them from my dvds at home of planet earth br br the movie continued and went on and on and on me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from planet earth br br we were very very disappointed as i think 90 of the footage is from planet earth i am saying 90 because some of the scenes i didn t recognize i have a feeling that i simply didn t remember them br br so finally what this movie really is is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of planet earth with a narration aimed at kids yes the narration is quite kiddish let me give you an example when they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub the narrator says the polar cubs are not like human kids they don t always listen to their mothers so in a nutshell this is condensed planet earth for kids 
this movie was very very mediocre and very very gory everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot not at all scary 
hilariously obvious drama about a bunch of high school kids who enjoy non stop hip hop break dancing graffiti and trying to become a dj at the roxy or something to be totally honest i was so bored i forgot even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and as a drama failed dismally we re supposed to find this kids likable and nice i found them bland and boring the one that i really hated was ramon he does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great excuse me he s defacing public property that isn t his to begin with also these great kids tap into the city s electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building uh huh so we re supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun br br i could forgive all that if the music was good but i can t stand hip hop the songs were at best mediocre and they were nonstop they re always playing it got to the point that i was fast forwarding through the many endless music numbers there are a few imaginative numbers the subway dance fight a truly funny santa number and the climatic roxy show if you love hip hop here s your movie but it you re looking for good drama mixed in forget it also how did this get a pg rating there s an incredible amount of swearing in this 
i saw this not too long ago and i must say this movie is terrible i watch crappy movies for fun scarecreow is not fun scarecrow is stupid you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings everyone picks on me the only girl that thinks i m not trailer trash likes one of the guys that pick on me i want to kill everybody wah ok i m exaggerating but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies br br adding to what i just said the kid s mom is promiscuous he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on mom s boyfriend tells him to leave kid refuses insisting that he isn t going to leave his own house boyfriend chases kid into corn field he kills kid right in front of mom mom screams in terror boyfriend is like omg i didn t mean to then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it kid was killed under a scarecrow though so like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance his victims haven t been stalked like this before br br to make matters worse this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days that s right 8 days i was going to give this movie a 2 because in spite of itself it has one or two redeeming moments i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting the horrible special effects the abysmal script and the bad camera work but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level br br this movie isn t nearly as good as i m making it out to be if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie or if you enjoy watching bad movies like i do then watch this at your own risk everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times 
the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester who couldn t act or sing in the title role aside from his very bad acting all of lester s singing had to be dubbed by a girl i don t know why they cast him at all since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well shani wallis was far too old to play nancy who was only supposed to be 16 the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way ross mccormack is the best artful dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was it was clearly political to award this old fashioned musical so many oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968 
wow this film is truly awful i can t imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast the story is disjointed fragmented and incoherent the telling leaden and predictable no wit no charm no humour not sexy in the least the characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake there s also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on when your lead is unfunny and unappealing it s uphill from there despite it s phony turn around ending where love triumphs over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach if this is what passes for humour and social comment then we re definitely doomed 
jill dunne is an attractive nice woman over whelmed by a smart mouthed teenage daughter liv and a petty two timing husband sean both of which were tediously self centered and obnoxious br br this was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm br br the storm doesn t even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film and then it isn t anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar br br the stalking likewise doesn t get intense until almost the end of the film br br most of the film we spend listening to jill and her insufferable daughter liv argue until i just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week br br jill s problem with liv is that she has taken up with zack a boy of questionable character and they are constantly making out in fact jill comes home to find the two of them on liv s bed br br the rest of the time we spend listening to jill s husband sean either whine at jill or criticize her br br sean was not at all appealing since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots br br the story begins with jill being notified of an out standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to and that she thought sean had never been to either br br jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner manager richard grant a very nice older divorced man who is sympathetic to her in fact when he spots her husband there again he phones jill and tips her off br br jill returns to the hotel sees sean with another woman she is upset leaves without sean seeing her and does absolutely nothing in fact she doesn t even say anything to sean when he arrives home this made no sense to me br br jill has given richard her business card and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate she shows him a condo afterwards they have a drink and things get cozy between them br br richard and jill are getting it on hot and heavy in fact he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary when jill suddenly decides to cut out br br jill and sean have a confrontation about his cheating sean whines about how jill has been letting him down since her father died apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault eventually jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to sean and of course that s all her fault too as far as sean is concerned br br the little family decides to go on a camping trip which means more whining and grousing among them especially from the spoiled daughter br br i was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody but jill br br 3 stars
this show is awful how is george wanting the death of his mother funny this show is terrible the parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services the daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat george isn t funny especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of spanglish ernie is a loser but at least i ve chuckled at him a few times but mainly at how pathetic he is george s mother benny in an awful despicable character sure her husband left her but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated george as a baby is beyond me br br can someone explain to me how george s head being big is funny it s not even that big i ve moved on from characters because they re too awful and it would take hours for me to write and i frankly don t care enough i do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom and is not worth your time br br i give it 2 starts because the wife is extremely attractive 
don t even ask me why i watched this the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel  it s too terrible for words the movie that is not the bronchitis the acting is deplorable richard grieco hams it up as a trigger happy gun slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film the script is dismal peppered with clichéd lines are you ready pardner purrs richard grieco to every single one of his victims dire avoid 
i will start this off by saying i couldn t get all the way through it i picked it up on a rainy day from walmart like the rest of the reviewers on this site i figured there wasn t any way i would regret my purchase was i wrong or what seriously now who approved this project they need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity that s the only fitting punishment i can think of for releasing something this bad the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam the acting isnt much better i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos yay who cares shecky moskowitz is unfunny and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser that s about as much of the plot as i understood br br overall it s the worst movie i ve ever seen i own it on dvd and have given it to many co workers to watch each comes back and laughs and says wow i didnt think i d ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in br br my response is always well now you can br br 
college students who are clearing out a condemned dormitory are stalked by an elusive killer br br the dorm that dripped blood is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans the movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine there s even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring in fact much of the story s build up is pretty forgettable save for one or two brutal murders but the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax and one fairly bold unconventional conclusion br br the cast is lackluster for the most part stephen sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character also look for a young daphne zuniga as an ill fated student br br over all this is a pretty standard b slasher effort but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho hum br br out of  
i got this movie because i worked at a movie store so i got free rentals it came in and the cover made it look alright hot chick carrying a weapon alright i ll check it out br br oh man bad move this was so horrible i spent half the movie watching in fast forward to get to the nudity which was minimal i think maybe three scenes of partial nudity br br cheesy dialogue crappy violence poor excuses of characters i feel bad putting this movie down because i know it was made on a cheap budget but so was clerks and it became a cult classic and a franchise br br 2 10 
 br br i saw this on the sci fi channel it came on right after the first one for some reason this movie kept me interested i don t know why stop asking br br spoilers okay it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie in the first movie he had a reason to kill people but in this sequal half of the killings attempted killings were basicly for no reason stanley killed the director due to creative differences he captured the co writer due to creative differences but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast no cast no movie he wanted it to look real when they died if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie use the special effects man of course like the first one the captured girl gets away and stanley ends up getting messed up and dissapears woooooow this movie had potential and the saddest thing of all the really sad part i would watch a cabin by the lake 3 only because i like judd nelson and he s the only good part about this sequal 
lifetime did it again can we say stupid i couldn t wait for it to end the plot was senseless the acting was terrible especially by the teenagers the story has been played a thousand times are we just desperate to give actors a job the previews were attractive and i was really looking for a good thriller once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie this isn t one of them unless one has nothing else to do i would avoid this one at all cost this was a waste of two hours of my life can i get them back i would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide that would have been more entertaining 
this movie is not only a very bad movie with awful actors or presumed actors a bored direction and a story unattractive it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent giallio torso directed by sergio martino in 1973 one of the most celebrated psycho thrillers of italian cinema and a cult movie around the world in la sanguinusa conduce la danza the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl with an peeping tom watching from a window of the bedroom naturally the scene in rizzo s movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino s film to put another black girl another white girl and another peeping tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that rizzo s movie has no ideas no originality no taste and nothing at all i think that such things are an offense to spectator 
this movie s full title is waqt race against time that s a race no one can ever win but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious waqt on this bakvaas this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made k3g look honest it strained my credulity too far it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline and deserves to be mocked for it br br it s not quite as awful as baghban or black but this movie has nothing to recommend it stupid pointless with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji the central plot is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many family bw films if my father who raised me and who i love dearly treated me like big b did akshay i d shoot him myself to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness 
lillian hellman s play adapted by dashiell hammett with help from hellman becomes a curious project to come out of gritty warner bros paul lukas reprising his broadway role and winning the best actor oscar plays an anti nazi german underground leader fighting the fascists dragging his american wife and three children all over europe before finding refuge in the states they settle in washington with the wife s wealthy mother and brother though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the german embassy playing poker it seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus and when we realize what the heart of the material is it seems a little patronizing the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives place being lectured to lukas has several speeches in the third act which undoubtedly won him the academy award yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit enter and exit as his spouse bette davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage but the role doesn t allow her much color their children are alternately humorous and annoying and geraldine fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put upon wife the intent here was to tastefully tactfully show us just because a man may be german that doesn t make him a nazi sympathizer we get that in the first few minutes the rest of this tasteful tactful movie is made up of exposition defensive confrontation and ultimately compassion it should be a heady mix but instead it s rather dry eyed and inert  from  
absolutely laughable film i live in london and the plot is so ill researched it s ridiculous no one could be terrorised on the london underground in the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs etc that there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely or that it s even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age br br the worst that s likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network another thorn in the side of the story br br if it had been set in a city i am not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance but it s not a high quality film so i just couldn t bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is br br i would have given it 0 10 if such a rating existed possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought i would like 
i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident well it must of been blonde women being stalked the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute s then disappearing and reappearing hiding he was nt even a super hero so i don t know how he did it he could nt frighten a cat and that s not hard to do br br the old mirror in the bathroom is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago you had the cop on the trail of the villain another cliché the director did nt have a clue and has made a film full of cliché s and make s scary move which was a comedy look scary pathetic 
zu warriors most definitely should ve been an animated series because as a movie it s like watching an old anime on acid the movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical god demon wizard thing the plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie the plot soon follows this chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed uwe boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i m going to say they are blurry and acid trip like i watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand who am i kidding i didn t understand it at all it felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980 s anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time i can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching inu yasha at episode 134 drunk yeah that s right you don t know what the hell is going on don t waste your brain trying to figure this out 
from the very beginning the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy handed that the outcome is entirely predictable any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters incorporating character arcs and three act structure in this film you will find none of that the police are the baddies and consequently are shown as shallow incompetent and cowards it never seems to occur to the makers of this film that police might be honourable citizens who see joining the police as a good way to contribute to the wellbeing of society br br the viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind on whether ned kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain the film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse but we get no clue as to his guilt or innocence we see him walk through the door of a gaol but only know that he has been inside for three years when we hear this much later in some dialogue br br this film contains many shots of ned looking at the camera with a serious expression i found the film a real chore to watch it is the direction for modern films and this one put me off watching any more 
perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see i ll start with the bad points of t he movie which pretty much covers the entire film first of all something no one can avoid terrible acting i swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked secondly bad unconvincing character work development you hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here all you figure is that they deserved it one way or another the scarecrow s character was overdone and a cheap rip off of the other great fantasy killers such as freddy or pinhead next bad dialog the scarecrow was full of horrid one liners that would make you laugh only because it was so terrible lines like let s go find some small animals to torture really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised last but not least next off bad casting how old was the guy who played lester like 30 the back of his head was balding for god s sake there is much more i could say about this film like it s cheap special effects it s high school film class effort but the point is understood it s just bad film making at it s worst as for what i found to be good in the movie entertaining for those with low low low standards would help put insomniacs to sleep a very cheap laugh or even a giggle 
how can you tell that a horror movie is terrible when you can t stop laughing about it of course the plot has been well covered by other reviewers so i ll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all br br some reviews have placed the location in south america others in africa i thought it was in some random island in the pacific where exactly does this take place seems to be a mystery the cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men and a man who looks like a young frank zappa banging the drums the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes br br one of the freakiest moments in the film is when pablito find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that i assume is blood starts screaming for minutes on and on and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and pablito kicks it a bit for what i assume is shits n giggles and the eyes actually move br br but of course then the freak is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad br br i hadn t laughed like this in a loooong while and i definitely recommend this film for a sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do grab a case of beers and start watching this film you ll love it if you are looking for a real horror or gore movie though don t bother 
i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny i saw it again last week and you can guess the result some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask me br br if you want a total b movie this is a good pick but don t expect too much from aliens dwarf size
i am a big fan of arnold vosloo finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie not just a bit part made me happy br br unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didn t like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos br br i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired but arnold is an excellent actor i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired br br i love arnold vosloo and he made the film viewable otherwise i would have written it off as another lousy film br br i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good but the sound effects of the shoot out were pretty bad there are some glitches in the film but they are overlookable considering the low caliber of the film br br all in all i enjoyed the film because arnold vosloo was in it br br jackie
watched this on dvd in original language with english subs either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn t make much of story and give any character development there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesn t need their presence to make it better or worse it s just bad the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long if anything this makes me think of a child s movie with its nonstop barrage of cg fight scenes and crap plot i m certain i grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy 
what did the director think everybody who has read the biography of artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that tassi was guilty that fact shows the real independence and emancipation in her most terrible hour she stands her man why do movies depicting renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the hollywood happy happy mood won while i would always defend a director s freedom to create his own reality in a movie i cannot make sense of turning artimisia s life story on its head very disappointing choice by the makers of this film 
there are bad movies terrible movies even boring movies i can watch most and put up until the end not this time avoid this like the plague annoying music throughout terrible editing no comedy its tackier than a novelty mug my missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be legally blonde material or something kind of watchable but never better than average chick flick its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button br br the girls well they were not great to start with but you have sank to the gravel i feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this pamela anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face br br please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen 
a lot of death happens in the wild you don t need to be a rocket scientist to figure that out but does it need to be the focus of a nature documentary what is with this fascination with gruesome death do we really have to see an adult elephant torn to shreds by a pack of hungry lions or a cheetah grabbing a gazelle by the throat in slow motion no less i thought this was going to be a family friendly nature film br br and why not have the courage to show the gruesome violence in the film s trailers were the filmmakers afraid of losing money br br then in typical comic relief fashion we get to see the magnificent birds of paradise perform mating rituals to the most annoying and stupid narration humanly possible it was surreal it s as if the filmmakers believed they were only addressing a roomful of first and second graders on a school field trip wow from the mean to the moronic in a heartbeat br br if there are any future nature documentary filmmakers waiting in the wings reading this film review why not focus on animals actually copulating giving birth laying eggs bathing sleeping cleaning each other socializing playing emotional displays other than fear and anger unusual behaviors like mouth brooding migration problem solving skills culture communication skills parenting healing abilities etc in other words stop focusing on violence or dumbing down beauty and why not be much more well rounded and focus on delight and inspiration instead 
shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role elizabeth shue is a commendable actress why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity i must give credit where credit is due though some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon s character sebastian caine i wouldn t recommend this movie to anyone man or woman that has any form of self respect to account for 
this has an interesting albeit somewhat fanciful sci fi plot but it s wasted with poor direction and shlocky special effects rae dawn chong is appealing despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent 
we don t have this on television in england but i walked it over the internet on youtube it s dumb immature and boring this is from the creator of earthworm jim douglas tennapel i never got into that cartoon but i must admit it better than this the cartoonist hasn t done anything for years since now for doug tennapel this is a comeback travesty and an all time low the story is about three cats who inherit a house and lots of money off their dead old lady master they are argumentative and keep on disagreeing on what their want to spend their money on boring the animation is dreadful the main characters are meant to be cats right but they don t look nothing like cats just weird animal monster looking creatures with big mouths pointed teeth and bulgy eyes the human and other animal characters are also drawn real ugly the theme song is terrible and irritating also the stories are lame and are most probably copied from older shows it surprised me how this show got 7 5 10 votes of other imdb viewers television really isn t what is used to be but now most of them is dumb cheaply made and boring some of you on the website might not agree with me well i m sorry but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad that britain don t have too tolerate this crap but i don t so it not my problem loser 2 10 
are you familiar with concept of children s artwork while it is not the greatest picasso any three year old has ever accomplished with their fingers you encourage them to do more if painting is what makes them happy there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child typically if a child loves to paint or draw you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles well this concept of children s artwork is how i felt about fuqua s depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait while on all accounts it was a horrid film it was impressive to see fuqua s style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments if you have seen either training day or king arthur you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait while foxx gives a horrid unchained performance there are certain scenes which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film but if you focus just on those scenes you will see why fuqua s name appears on so many best of film lists br br i will never disagree with someone that fuqua s eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking i am surprised that more of hollywood hasn t jumped aboard this bandwagon even in the silly feature bait you are witness to fuqua s greatness two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work alas in the rest of this film all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood we have seen this two often and no matter who you are you cannot recreate the wheel it is just impossible with this genre and it is proved with bait i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film i was just tired of the structure and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it he did not br br then there was the acting while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral again i was disappointed foxx was annoying not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be ad libed and what should be used to further the plot instead we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first an actor second fuqua should have stopped this immediately foxx s jokes destroyed his character which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of instead of character development he would crack a joke neither style worked no joke was funny the rest of the cast was average by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles they were brining nothing new to the table nothing solid to the story and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film they were pawns filling in dead air space fuqua had no control over this mess and the final verdict only supports that accusation br br overall this was a sad film with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand foxx was annoying without character lines and a complete bag of cheese in each scene i saw no emotion and when emotion was needed to convey a message he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues are my words harsh i don t think so when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity some edible characters and themes that seem to hit close to home bait contained none of these while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film the remaining five hundred were disastrous apparently i took the bait when renting this film but now having seen it hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibble br br grade  out of  
there s so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense some of the characters intense and surprising characters don t make it to the screen at all and those who do are watered down to the point that there s no reason for their existence br br where s the relationship between christophe and marcel where s the continued affair between marcel and juliet why does dolly rose appear at all since her story s never explained where s the rape and redemption of marie whose greatest attribute is that she can pass for white and her marriage to richard why does the film end with marcel s beating at the hands of his father we learn nothing of aglae beyond that she s a bitch who hates her husband why no backstory explaining this hatred br br as for the performances there s not a one that s better than mediocre though that s likely due to the lousy script best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard but richard s not on screen enough to salvage the film worst is jasmine guy as dolly rose though again it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she s given to work with br br all in all this is just terrible i thought it d be impossible for any anne rice book turned film to be worse than exit to eden but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit how is it that rice is such a slut she ll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen 
this is not a good film the acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing the film doesn t seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route i never saw the first film but this one doesn t stand up on its own merits there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire not worth the effort of watching
the annoying mouse and lullaby really got to me and really had nothing to do with the story it s something i would have done my 1st year in film school very sad additionally the story just seemed to drag on for no apparent reason there were too many things just thrown in there that had nothing to do with the story which makes me feel that the creative team didn t really know what they were doing or just that it should have been shorter which would have been a blessing not a crime as i have just watched all of the episodes up to this point over the past week i d have to say that this was by far the worst and i just wanted to warn others not to start with this one 
i very nearly walked out but i d paid my money and my nearly as disgusted friend wanted to hold out after the endearing wide eyed innocence of a new hope and the thrilling sophistication of the empire strikes back i remember awaiting return of the jedi with almost aching anticipation but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage i was bitterly disappointed and enraged at lucas he should have been ashamed of himself but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn t have subatomic particle of shame in his cold greedy heart episode i would go on to reinforce this fact your honor i call jarjar binks br br from the initial raising of the gate at jabba s lair this film was nothing more than a two plus hour commercial for as many licensable profit making action figures as lucas could cram into it the pig like guards the hokey flesh pigtailed flunky that vile muppet pet of jabba s the new and recycled cabaret figures the monsters etc etc ad vomitum then there were the detestably cute and marketable ewoks pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens fifteen seconds each on screen and the kiddies just gotta have one for their collection the blatant exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating br br lucas didn t even bother to come up with a new plot he just exhumed the death star from a new hope and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment what an appalling slap in the face to his fans i can t shake the notion that lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans i ve got these lemmings hooked so bad that i can crank out the worst piece of stinking putrid garbage that i could dream up and they ll flock to the theaters to scarf it up plus all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in and i get a cut from every single one it ll make me even more obscenely rich br br there may have been a paltry partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip off i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that lucas so avariciously embraced in this total absolute sell out to profit 
i received this movie as a gift i knew from the dvd cover this movie are going to be bad after not watching it for more than a year i finally watched it what a pathetic movie br br i almost didn t finish watching this bad movie but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie br br trust me when i say this movie sucks i am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed to make this pathetic movie but it couldn t have cost more than 20 000 to produce this movie all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera about 15 people with no acting skills a scrip that were written by a couple of drunk people br br in the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town he are completely unharmed they went to a supposed to be abandon house but luckily for the it almost complete furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not what it seems br br then the supposed drunk man start telling tara ghost zombies stories br br the fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history br br his story br br sgt ben draper let one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion after letting the poor soldier private wilson do sit ups he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse ben draper br br buries him in a shallow grave br br but sgt ben draper are in for n big surprise his wife girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills sgt ben draper to take revenge on private wilson the soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf br br the twist ending were so lame br br even if you like b horror movies don t watch this movie
the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy but let s look at the obsolete theme of the movie br br with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom since watch on the rhine author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real life story julia from her book pentimento as one of the most odious of a plethora of western based ussr apologists it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists who had just proved their military superiority in spain br br as one reviewer correctly noted this is not a pro american play and movie as lillian went to her grave an american loathing communist this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america 
couldn t believe it clipped sentences good grief know what all true real people ever talk like this don t think so good girl stout fellow stiffen upper lip only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 gary cooper such a dish movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights seemed endless anyway think all franchot tone s dialogue dubbed when crawford and young make a special effort to sound british they come over as irish handy tip we brits clip words not sentences and somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time but that s only if we ve been to a really good public school 
this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago i ve watched it at least 20 times  br br the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines br br on the plus side it s the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldn t believe how terrible the movie was br br i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies 
return to cabin by the lake does not in any way stand up to the original with only one main character returning for the sequal the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time i am a huge fan of the first film the story line and acting was really good but this is one movie that i will never again watch it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like but with much worse acting i ve personally seen better acting in soap operas it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh i in no way recommend this movie to anyone watching it will just detract from the first 
if this film had a budget of 20 million i d just like to know where the money went a monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although i must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original play station 1 game and early pc games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la george lucas circa 1975 83 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing for about the same 20 million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made i would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again i hated it completely i regress i say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it i sold it to a guy for a dollar i m betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films i want my money back 
the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980 s soap opera deeply character driven films are great but only if the characters are compelling and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel the villain s dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist the great lt columbo himself is no where near his famous lovable self effacing crumpled self and the bride kidnap victim is a whimpering one dimensional damsel in distress in any sense of reality this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little and speaking of reality the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police the police give me a break everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case this was no columbo just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours 
blank check is a movie that i saw on tv one day and like most movies they air on tv blank check wasn t that good first of all no one i have ever met has seen blank check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s also blank check won t be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixar s films i wouldn t call blank check a bad film but its not really entertaining either blank check isn t a entertaining film because nothing about it is original everything just makes you go what haven t i seen this before blank check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from richie rich to home alone blank check isn t a bad movie but it deserves to fade into obscurity 
this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw fishburne and the usually solid ed harris connery seems miscast as a harvard academic the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree the scripting and direction are extremely poor connery s charisma and screen presence are the film s only virtue manipulative violent and ridiculous 2 10 avoid it 
in some ways the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination however no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close up shots i felt as though i had been beat over the head with the so called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people br br the writer appears to have simply lifted clichés from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters the actors did not help matters no chemistry i guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories however the writers didn t work very hard to develop the chemistry sure they re both attractive but whether they re attractive to each other seemed to be an open question br br the confidence turner s character shows in sabato s developed far too quickly and for no particular reason sabato s character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just can t seem to play by the rules think of the jeff goldblum character in independence day usually that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance sabato s character does not he s cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball he appears to be right by random chance br br the death scenes are comical every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them the symptoms looked like bad claymation sort of like that video from the 80s peter gabriel i think 
two years ago on berlin film festival we watched the amos kollek movie sue in the panorama program with a wonderful anna thomson in the leading part it s a film about loneliness and sex and how the one thing is compensated by the other in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous antithesis of sue extension du domaine de la lutte which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem but unfortunately we can t sympathize with our hero because he is unnecessarily and incomprehensibly tired of company and himself own fault i m sorry i can t understand him not enough the writer director actor want us admitting to him that it s not his destroyed self consciousness or the passivity of his personality what brought him so far but the rotten society and its image of sexuality yes there are some deeper insights about gender relations but we won t follow him so far and the point is that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate having no sex who didn t notice yet it s a quite depressing film br br in the beginning there had been some starts to be more accurate in sketching the situation at the bed store the hero speaks about the hindrances buying a new bed perhaps it s too broad getting up the stairs you have to stay at home half a day this is a satire about a character who doesn t know taking the life and heart in hands doing something the movie doesn t follow this path but handles his characters with helplessness nobody believes that our hero is able to instigate tisserand for a murder too dull too kind too passive to finish there are women and the world it s not a device of a modern sexualized society help you as you can but don t follow the messages and the wisdom of this movie which announces bankruptcy to human relationships without seizing the real conflicts within 
this movie is by far the worst movie ever made if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don t make the damn film i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it i d give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie 
blonde and blonder was unfunny basically it was a rip off girl version of dumb and dumber but less funny and they used too much background noises and music way too much background noises and music if you ask me it starts out immensely boring and totally inane it doesn t pick up pace anywhere soon and i was feeling more frustrated as this nonsense carried on maybe the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 was the last 30 minutes i found it somewhat entertaining and interesting as it neared the end but that was the only part also i couldn t help but like pamela anderson and denise richard s characters a little even though this movie didn t get any laughs from me it kept my attention i wouldn t say to completely avoid this movie but there are thousands of better films for you to spend your time and money on than blonde and blonder 
first of all i was expecting caged heat to be along the same lines as ilsa the wicked warden boy was i wrong in no way is this film 70s exploitation chix in chains or women in prison sure the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison who wear street clothes btw but nothing happens br br there aren t strong rivalries no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape and no inmates make out there are 2 shower scenes that i suspect is just recycled footage but no fights breaks out no one is seduced here or anywhere for that matter aside from the lack of plot unconvincing unsympathetic and flat characters a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to free their fellow inmates  br br puh lease the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset as opposed to letting this mess continue br br i feel scammed 
the original was a good movie i bought it on tape and have watched it several times and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasn t expecting such a bomb the romance was flat the sight gags old the spoken humor just wasn t this may not have been the worst movie i ve ever seen but it comes close 
ladies and gentlemen please don t get fooled by a stanley kubrick film tag this is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film in shining there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive foolish attempt made to create chilling horror everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality all that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley the hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too a word about the actors jack nicholson looks like a lost lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do there is not much to be said of a bald colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor no need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy it cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor kubrick is not alive to make any changes 
we have all been asking ourselves why don t they remake the slasher films that were only ok instead of remaking the ones that were great already that way they can only make it better well with prom night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s jamie lee curtis film and made it even worse its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens the knife in this slasher flick is blunt the director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window the cast who include britney snow try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared more annoying is how the death scenes are handled it also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered yet in pours the money from americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office slasher movies are a lot of fun but in prom nights case it made me want to download the original i ve seen scarier oc and dawsons creek episodes
i am not so much like love sick as i image finally the film express sexual relationship of alex kik sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness frustration and jealous at last alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future ending up was sad br br the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12 00pm on 08 10 06 with us watched the movie together after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicate br br on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere i don t feel any particular impression and effect from the movie the love proceeding of alex and kiki and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story br br the two main reasons i don t like this movie are firstly the film didn t told us how they started to fall in love sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living then two girls are fall in love it doesn t make sense at all how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man too much fragments you need to image and connect those stories by your mind secondly the whole film didn t have a scene of alex and kik s sexual intercourse that s what i was waiting for however it still had some parts were deserved to recommend the ear piercing part was kind of interesting alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik s love that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love also the scene of they were lying in the soccer field the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate 
the bloodsucker leads the dance what a laughable title it s so utterly misleading it s not surprising that the film makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie br br the story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island br br very little happens in this film and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice artists these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial level morons it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal but the voice artists cannot be blamed for the script it s a travesty unintentionally funny at best pathetic at worst the story in general is to say the least uneven the women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tedious br br the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience it doesn t remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders start happening they all occur off screen all we get is a few half hearted severed head shots br br a few people have said that this movie is a giallo i cannot agree less with this opinion anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it it s basically a soft core porn film with a horror angle but it s not very erotic either br br i can t recommend this to anyone 
you may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers br br i m sorry but spielberg didn t deserve to win any oscar for this piece and i think the academy was right in that vote the way spielberg directs this is so contrived so meddlesome while watching this movie a distinction made during a film as art course i have taken was screaming at me sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered sentimentality is sugary and unreal a false view of life this is over the top sentimentality when in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity as celie and shug avery do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from nettie they have found there are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film all the men crowding around miss millie s car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he s working on the whole troop of revelers heading from the jook joint en masse to the chapel as if magically entranced by the choir s singing on and on nothing rings true i even wondered if harpo s name was chosen purposefully because it s his wife sophia s real name oprah backwards spielberg isn t above such cuteness br br it s not that spielberg is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion schindler s list was amazing deeply touching for me and i greatly admire saving private ryan too for its realism even if the story is a bit contrived 
any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn t bother with an actual story it s annoying those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first and the story simply tacked on for this reason we often talk of the story jumping through hoops as it twists about trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion br br the story in comet over broadway doesn t just jump through hoops it s a three ring circus it s so ludicrous so ill conceived so disingenuous that if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen you will be carrying on quite a rant before it s through br br the central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession since it s all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion so in the end there s no point to the story the theme becomes irrelevant and as is often the case with poor screenplays the acting doesn t save a thing 
the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands but she is speaking german to him the 2 languishes are completely different its like saying well he takes french commands and start talking spanish br br james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest the role just doesn t fit him even if its mend to be a comedy br br to many stereotype predicable stuff typical comment or comebacks br br if you don t look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv but i wouldn t suggesting renting it 
having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly i thought lion king 1 5 might be worth watching what a disappointment disney must be getting desperate for revenues br br especially now that they lost the deal with pixar br br basically they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor s floor and glued them together to make a br br quick buck unlike lk i ii both of which had strong story lines br br this movie hardly has a story at all while the characters and animation are always fun to look at there is simply not enough material here for a movie some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings br br disney shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck br br next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work 
these writings write about the end of the plot so don t read it if you haven t seen this rubbish br br i found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror if i owned a video store i d put it in the boring section this film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks br br this film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary well i drive to work and back almost every day and trust me it s not scary it even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving even the little kid does it too round and round he goes and he never stops what s so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour i think nothing and if you watch it you will not think so too br br the family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason that s all that happens and as you can see it s rubbish 
yesterday was earth day in the us and other countries and i went to see the full feature movie version of earth by disneynature i guess like the auto manufacturers disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet maybe they really do care about the planet i don t know but i don t think it warrants a special unit with the word nature in it i do know that my youngest daughter loves mickey mouse and who am i to tell a one year old my personal feelings about disney br br aside from incredible cinematography it was a typical disney disappointment for me preceded by a half dozen disney movie trailers rife with disney cliché over dramatic music recycled footage i was even starting to think that james earl jones narration is getting a bit boring i like james earl jones but his work for disney and morgan freeman doing every warner brothers narrative starts to wear thin i really think that disney bought some bbc nature photography that was so spectacularly done they felt it would sell itself if they slapped some orchestral music and recognizable sound bites on it br br and what is disney s obsession with showing predators chasing and killing baby animals there were a half dozen such scenes complete with bleating youngsters on the verge of getting their throats ripped out i think disney needs to recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action movie oriented teenagers that got dragged to this film by their parents i was also cognizant of how disney stopped well short of implying that man had anything to do with the climate change are they so afraid of the tiny minority of deniers that they think it s still a controversial subject br br i recommend skipping this one and renting the blue planet dvds on netflix nature films seem to be best done by the british at the moment 
let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well loved and well respected not to say revered author in order to draw attention to their home movies out on dvd br br hyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers in fact lied about only to be revealed finally as ludicrously inept in every department the fans of wells and of his book have been after the blood of its writer producer director since it appeared on dvd br br many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for film school students since this film does not even use the basic grammar of scripting editing continuity direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time it is possible the director did show up for the shoot certainly there was no one present who knew even remotely what they were doing br br an ongoing thread continues to evolve on this imdb page which should at least furnish the watchers of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their 9 00 outlay br br much was promised absolutely nothing was delivered except monty python meets war of the worlds with all the humour taken out br br indefensible trash just unbelievable br br there are real independent film makers out there to be checked out people who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gums about how great their movie is going to be br br people could do worse than keep an eye on brit film maker jake west s evil aliens for example 
robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time this movie is so wasteful of talent it is truly disgusting the script is unbelievable the dialog is unbelievable jane fonda s character is a caricature of herself and not a funny one the movie moves at a snail s pace is photographed in an ill advised manner and is insufferably preachy it also plugs in every cliche in the book swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role but so what br br equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review when a movie is this worthless it doesn t require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape avoid this movie 
i picked up this movie for 5 dollars at a discount book store adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie well it wasn t there was absolutely no story line at all bad jokes and the other comedian said the f word every other word he said cursing usually dosen t bother me but this was over the top and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie in my opinion don t buy this movie its a waste of money
just a stilted rip off of the infinitely better murder she wrote it is absolutely amazing that this poorly written garbage lasted for a full eight years i m sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show van dyke who only had a decent career in the 1960s never was much of an actor at all and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993 he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking his talentless real life son barry a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn t involve his father plays his son in the series 
an uninspired and undistinguished new columbo which sees the man in the mac attend his nephew s wedding only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night columbo investigates br br and that it is about it indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script given that it is written by robert van scoyk who penned the highly enjoyable columbo story murder under glass in the detective s heyday there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to columbo by the script writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding which include everybody who was there br br devoid of every columbo trait possible i thought i was watching an episode of hill street blues an insult to the history of the series with appropriately soap opera style acting very avoidable stuff 
and rent a good horror movie it s like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn t realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like scream and scary movie br br in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written stupid we re going to the prom junk i wanted to claw my ears off honestly the hills has better dialog br br there really was no need to make this movie leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking her really guy is obsessed with her really br br all the characters act in stupid ways including the police br br the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem no resistance from victims nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back the people are like mentally disabled sheep br br by the by if you re a gore fan you ll be disappointed too all the killing is kept offscreen and is ahem tastefully done br br none of the killings is the least bit interesting most of the time they ve already happened by the time we find out br br the only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies oh kitty you scared me i thought you were the killer aiieeee br br and then at the end when it s time for the killer to die well let s just say it s the easiest and most obvious choice snore br br the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough don t encourage this kind of lazy film making br br  br br so save your money and rent carrie or friday the 13th or halloween or scream or scary movie to get a good scare with some original twists 
when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar an arab potentate visiting washington d c his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state unknown to her however the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda br br a map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen in an area of barren desert known as the rub al khali or empty quarter in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero and virtually zero strategic value but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government who are keen to build a military base there need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem sunny s new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet her br br a plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire but in fact the film s satirical content is rather toned down possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country s foreign policy this was after all the year in which ronald reagan carried forty nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters br br the film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm sunny is a typical goldie character pretty sweet natured naive and not too bright there is however a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde goldie tries her best to save this one but never succeeds part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed on the one hand sunny is a sweet innocent country girl from oregon on the other hand she is a 35 year old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girl br br the more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his her material and protocol is simply unfunny whatever humour exists is tired and strained relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who apparently all lust after western women particularly if they are blonde and blue eyed there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid eighties as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley nastassia kinski film harem about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman and the mini series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting the film makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter day mr smith goes to washington sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizen s duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy br br goldie hawn has made a number of good comedies such as cactus flower overboard and housesitter but protocol is not one of them i have not seen all of her films but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst 3 10
before i go on i have to admit to being a huge bon jovi fan in fact thats what attracted me to the dvd case in the first place i probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first vampires title so much br br but this isn t half as good not even jon could save this film for me my main problem would be that it simply isn t scary apart from jon s character derek bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn t care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire drug addict woman the female vampire simply isn t scary or sexy rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then another huge problem is that everything is just too bright there is no atmosphere or sense of dread i know the first vampires being set in new mexico wasn t exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be this film has no tension like that br br the story is basically the same as before vampire wants berzier s cross to be able to walk in daylight however the story has less cool bits this time there is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master the original vampire as in the first film you really don t care who or what this one is there is no army of masters instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a disneyland attraction then a creepy temple br br so there you have it really lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story a real let down for me personally 
i could never stand watching happy days after chachi joined the cast so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio jodie foster in her first grown up role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess two hours out of my life that i ll never get back no noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all i couldn t have cared less the story of california teens in the 1970 s where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots don t waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie 
 the 40 year old virgin exists in a world i don t understand a world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to f off and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded a world where it s really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples cars a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities and a world without any funny jokes i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch not very funny to begin with and stretched out beyond all rational thought the chest waxing scene went on forever br br the characters aside from carell were totally one note and the romantic elements were completely contrived particularly the scene where keener finds porn in carell s apartment that was just lame br br and i also found the aquarius sequence totally annoying and excessive i hated hated hated this movie 
well i saw this movie yesterday and it s unfortunately worse than you could think first of all the plot is idiotic it has no sense at all the screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues the audience was laughing many times and the suspense is very low actors play so so with an exception of sharon stone who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments the saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like i want to beep you and it looks like let s say it gently a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all that erotic tension from bi1 is totally gone from the technical point of basic instinct 2 is a mediocre movie better than typical straight to dvd but on a far lower lever than the original movie for instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly the director of basic instinct 2 is no paul verhoeven and it shows the new composer is no jerry goldsmith and its shows the script is done by people who are no match for joe eszterhas there s no substitute for michael douglas in it the film looks cheap and badly edited at times i m sorry but my first thought after i left the theater was why heaven t they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie all to all the original movie is like citizen kane compared to this the first basic instinct is a classic and was a kind of break thru in the popular cinema it was provoking sexy and controversial it had the best sharon stone s performance in her career it had this specific paul verhoeven s style unfortunately basic instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie badly directed and a sure razzie award winner in many categories it s a pity that they made this film 
pros nothing br br cons everything br br plot summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by zombies br br review never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles filmed on a budget of what looks to be about 20 bucks tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldn t act to save their lives and gore that s more gross than frightening how does a movie like this even get made simply put avoid tzc like a sexually transmitted disease br br my last 2 cents humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films they re brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like this br br my rating 1 out of 10
considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign i would have expected something to be worth the fuzz from the opening scene on it goes rapidly downwards nothing to get the attention not a mind catching thing in the whole plot baaad baad acting incest and lesbianism are promising themes but the script analyses none of the two in depth the too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene at this point that could have saved some of the movie so you can imagine how bad it is many other things could be said but please watch the movie yourselves i am an egoist and i would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1 2h of their lives like i did 
an actress making a movie in africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom the producer hires some one to go and bring her back complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking god who likes to eat naked women br br this is a gory sleazy movie there is copious amounts of nudity and violence not to mention violence against nude people its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being and if the movie wasn t so boring this film would be a classic lets face it despite the gore the nasty sex and abuse and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer the pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out there are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other even though its ultimately all one story worst of all almost no one says anything most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that i ll do what i want its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren t for the frequent screams of the victims i d recommend this as a sleep aide br br this is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep or unless you need to see every euro cannibal movie br br that was cropped to remove the subtitles their print also has no opening titles 
around the late 1970 s animator don bluth frustrated with the output his company disney was churning defected from the mouse house to form his own studio his first production the secret of nimh was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day this was followed by an american tail and the land before time both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh they still are very charming enjoyable features for both children and grown ups but before long don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven critics were especially harsh on this film and matters weren t helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney s the little mermaid br br considering that the movie has such a friendly sounding title one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling deceit crime mistreatment and murder that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say but it does call into question over whether the film is for children on the other hand it s hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven in short it s a movie with a major identity crisis br br set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans the movie starts out when charlie b barkin a rough and tumble german shepherd is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner a nasty cigar puffing pitbull carface before you know it charlie finds himself in heaven albeit by default here a whippet angel annabelle tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are usually loyal and kind this line represents the confused nature of the movie since the dogs in the movie the whippet aside are presented as anything but br br upon realizing that he s been murdered charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy charlie rescues carface s prize annemarie a human girl who can talk to animals charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down although he refuses to admit it charlie does grow to love annemarie br br the concept of the story isn t as problematic as the execution aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three quarters through none of the other characters emerge as likable nor frankly are even worth caring about unfortunately that also applies to charlie in trying to make him an anti hero the script only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable as such the audience feels no empathy for charlie and worse his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing besides the lack of an endearing lead the movie s other problem is in the structure of the story the slowly paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie s running time the aforementioned musical alligator seems to have been thrown in from nowhere as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastel colored pups pizza the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft a bit more polish could have made this a tighter impactful story br br matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t j kuenster or the uneven voice cast as mentioned burt reynolds stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further dom deluise as itchy is pretty good but he s had better roles notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh ken page as mentioned is awesome in anything he does but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best similarly wasted are loni anderson melba moore and charles nelson reilly judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show br br barsi aside the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation technically this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth s team particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine demon if anything the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling br br on the whole however i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion the overall package is not in the same league as bluth s better efforts animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry but by the time it s over all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth 
good grief i can t even begin to describe how poor this film is don t get me wrong i wasn t expecting much to begin with let s face it a pg 13 slasher flick is pre destined to be missing the ummm slashing so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore but it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away br br we have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy and here s a turnup for the books she never changes hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing character development if you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again br br on top of this we re handed possibly the least intriguing killer ever to grace the genre i m not joking when i say that dora the explorer has scarier villains than this movie br br finally because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept director what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time br br closets that s what br br lots and lots of closets big closets small closets mirrored closets closets to narnia so many damned closets you ll not want to dress yourself for another year in fact this movie should have just been called closet and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the dvd case on the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by roger and ebert something to the extent of what the f did we just waste our time watching 
i have read all of the love come softly books knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book but generally they at least have the main point of the book i was highly disappointed in this movie the only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that missy s father comes to visit that is all the story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes sad from the book that i just couldn t enjoy it even if i didn t read the book it was too sad i do know that pioneer life was rough but the whole movie was a downer the rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great 
viewers gushing over everything including the title sequence would have us believe this is some sort of cinematic miracle but trust me folks this is one of the most embarrassingly bad films you could ever see and if you re not laughing at it five minutes in i d say you ve lost your sense of humor br br david niven plays a doomed and bravado besotted raf pilot who somehow thinks it appropriate to engage an impressionable air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love just as he s plunging to his certain and fiery death of course he s spared by a quirk of metaphysical chance and washes up on the beach just as this same air traffic controller is riding by on her bicycle br br looking past the bizarre homo erotic subtexts the most bizarre aspects of the movie are how it weaves such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a convoluted attempt to argue some kind of point about the universal nature and power of love we get it fly boys like girls in skirts and heels and girls like em back and apparently all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough for your movie to get 10 stars on imdb br br as for the quality of the production the continuity editing is poor enough to induce cringing and the lighting is perhaps even worse than that but you hardly have time to notice because the script is so bad there are games played with technicolor and foreshadowing and freeze motion br br the best shots are the early ones on the beach but after that it s all downhill the staircase is hardly the odessa steps to say the least and i d really caution anyone from feeling like they d have to see this lame attempt at movie making on their account the movie overall is bad enough to be funny and that s about the best thing i can say for it 
this film differentiates itself from the run of the mill wonder of the human body documentaries by bravely if bizarrely opting to elicit disgust in the viewer in one scene the camera closes in on a gigantic 50 foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it in another the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo in a final tour de force the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of teenage armpit hair unfortunately i m not making any of this up see this film if you must but bring your vomit bag and don t have pasta salad beforehand 
overall an extremely disappointing picture very very slow build up to the basic storyline the role of maria schrader searching for her families secret past spoilers her mother ruth is rescued from the nazis by a german woman played by katja riemann the entire character of ruth is so one dimensional so stereotypical  spoilers end the film cuts back and forth between present day new york and berlin and berlin 40s something please when you do that give the audience an indication of what time exactly the story takes place there is never a clear indication of time very annoying worst part is the end  spoilers the entire show and jabber about the jews being so terribly tormented simply by a bureaucratic accident give me a break that s how the jews got out of the rosenstrasse the question of who freed the jews is never answered was is goebels who freed them did lean fischer sleep with goebels in venice the film won an acting award for k riemann why i have no idea must be the jewish theme
i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywood not very big names in it interested enough i decide to give it a shot later it was a tough to bear experience believe me then after finally seeing the credits roll i tought we turks really suck at hollywood style film making this is an insult to the heist hostage movie genre but then wait i checked some names and no they were not turkish names and no this was not a turkish movie on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director crew that made me thinking again how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project with money probably that kept me thinking further how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answer by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce or vice versa i don t have any information on that so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as it makes you think in my case even meditate and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesn t give even that affect this one at least makes you think it makes you wonder it leaves you with disbelief and then it makes you wonder again 
i found this film to be quite an oddity from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much pinpoint the reason why jean marc barr although i love him to bits is quite miscast here and although i can t figure for the life of me who would be better i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work everything else is fine except for the stabs at weak comedy and i really like richard e grant as the british major it just suffers from one thing jean marc 
this film was choppy incoherent and contrived it was also an extremely mean spirited portrayal of women i rented it because it was listed as a comedy and because the cover said andie mcdowell was acting up a storm in it she wasn t i m a gal i watched this film with two guys and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was br br warning plot summary below rampant spoilers br br the movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends they want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her but she s so happy with her oversexed puppy that you re rooting for them to stick it out and sure enough she decides to marry the guy but her harpy girlfriend aided by the wishy washy one sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her it works she has a fight with him he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck so now he s dead two thirds of the way through the film and although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant br br she s already broken off relations with her girlfriends because they were so unsupportive alone and pitiful she decides to marry the boring guy did i mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister she had asked him to marry her to the young guy but now she tells him she ll marry him and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion but her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home where they not quite confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed she has the kid in the final scene they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink smoke and be smug i kid you not it s that bad i left out the part about the cancer red herring and the harpy s ridiculous lesbian moment 
this film once sensational for its forward thinking politics and depictions of free love and sexual liberation has been reduced by time to a mere curiosity it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned and seized by governments in many countries given how socialistic sweden eventually became the radicalism of its politics once controversial appear naive and almost mainstream four decades later and its sex scenes at one time the subject of sensational obscenity trials look pretty tame in a modern context nevertheless the film and accompanying documentaries detailing its many controversies and influences remains marginally watchable as an early reliquary of 60 s youth rebellion one part of the film that still holds up its self consciousness with respect to the fourth wall every once in a while the filmmakers film themselves making the film the satiric playfulness of this still elicits a chuckle 
i cannot believe how popular this show is i consider myself an avid sci fi fan i have read countless sci fi novels and have enjoyed many sci fi movies and tv shows i really wouldn t even consider this true sci fi every episode i have sat through was like a lame watered down version of a star trek episode minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting br br it s basically a bunch of people standing around in army fatigues talking about something boring who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like earth with people who look and sound just like humans it seemed extremely low budget the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts and the many attempts at humor fall flat it reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it trying to be funny but he is not it is just sad br br the movie was terrible as well there is so much you can do with a portal through space yet every place the army people go is boring this shows no imagination i actually thought the tv series alien nation from a few years back was much better that show actually had good story lines and decent characters i wasn t crazy about alien nation but compared to this overrated crap it was great br br also unlike the great new battlestar galactica series stargate copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely they should have at least updated the cheesy toilet flushing special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate 
i love jamie foxx br br and i enjoy 99 of all movies i see br br and i walked out of this one br br now i admit it may have had something to do with the two middle aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing but this was just so incredibly annoying there could be no sustained camera shot and no camera shot from a conventional angle everything had to be in your face loud and annoying br br the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich like but at this point it s just old and tired he brought nothing new or interesting from all the characters too many lines you saw coming too many you ve heard before and too many tough guy lines and i don t mind that sort of thing really as long as there s a bit of originality to it in fact pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked br br i love jamie foxx and i think he s really funny and i thought he was funny in this movie but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else br br this movie needed less shoot em up less annoying camera shots more emotion more feeling and more jamie foxx i gave it a 2 
where to start if this movie had been a dark comedy i would say it was fannn tastic unfortunately for me and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare this movie was meant to be a thriller the only thrill i got was watching kirkland s lousy rendition of anne wilkes from misery sans snowy woodland area if you want a good laugh on a rainy friday night with some friends then i highly recommend this movie but if you want to watch something at least half way decent then don t even bother br br i for one enjoy crappy films the worse the better in most cases but wow i meant wow the only person in the entire film that didn t stink it up was the little boy played by vincent berry the only reason why i even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do 
 feast of all saints where  when  br br was the feast of all saints storyline and theme edited out br br what a waste of a wonderful title there is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the feast of all saints nor is there anything in the story about all souls day which the term is referencing why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about all souls day or the feast of all saints br br embarrassly bad script amateur writing br br how did they attract such great talent to this clunker the writing is so amateur characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience not at all the way people talk to each other br br what was the director thinking br br the directing is equally bad the forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish in one scene a character is yelling take your hands off of me and no one is touching him the most badly directed scene however is the incredibly over the top battle scene at the beginning of the film br br excessive gore in a very fake silly battle scene br br there are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene it looks like a saturday night live skit you can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys exaggerating every little gasp and twitch the blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes br br this whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie you almost expect someone like will ferrell and mike myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline br br who in real life would ever behave this way br br the most ridiculous bit of writing directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene br br a little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father who is terribly mutilated and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds even a totally idiot would know he is dead yet she is very monotonously repeating over and over daddy daddy  while looking at someone off screen she delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day br br even if the poor kid had any acting skills the scene is completely unbelievable the little girl wouldn t even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while she calmly stands there natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified running away from the bloody carnage br br are we suppose to be horrified or laugh br br one particularly goofy detail that gives the scene an snl satire tone is the father hanging with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek he looks like a fish on a hook the unintentionally funny details make the whole scene come across as fake and silly br br in fantasy la la land mothers and daughters are the same age br br another funny detail is that you see a central character the little girl s mother at the end of the scene and in the next scene that occurs 20 years later she looks exactly the same she is still young and beautiful and now the same age as her daughter br br i almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful but i tried to stick it out because i wanted to see the louisiana settings and i like all the actors i don t know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles br br who was the targeted audience br br the excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows it is also a strange way to start a movie that for the rest of the time seems targeted to romance novel reading females weird inconsistency in tone 
at least with the teenage geek gets the girl films the guy is usually unpopular with girls in the 40 year old virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin but then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did i miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years br br one of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them i find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent tv comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs they ve done the gross out movies they ve done the let s act like all americans have a mental age of 15 where will they go next br br this film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it 
i ll keep this short as a movie like this doesn t deserve a full review br br given the setting this movie could have been something really special it could have been another 28 days later or even a blair witch project br br the first 20 or so minutes of the movie i was really excited directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense although i don t think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london underground br br characters were a big let down our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap and you really don t care if she dies or not as many people have said before i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or two br br the main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie but when he is revealed i was really disappointed i won t spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match br br all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark br br just to highlight how lame this movie was the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain instead they run away 
first i bought it at the video store second i watched it third it was boring fourth it was not funny fifth most of the antics were lame and last but not least it s not only a bad movie it s a total fiasco br br i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film i pity it because it was his first movie even if you are a huge adam sandler fan don t bother watching this movie instead just take the video board a yacht and throw it overboard 
up until the last 20 minutes i was thinking that this is possibly jackie chan s worst movie the final fight sequence changed all that it is long and good and intense indeed one of the highlights of chan s career but to get to it you have to sit through a lot of comedy that might amuse five year olds and endless football scenes not to mention the dubbing dragon lord is worth renting for the final fight alone but the rest of the movie is only for jackie collectors and even then only for those who ve already seen at least 15 of his other movies 
this film is awful not offensive but extremely predictable the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid 60 s the father the principal at the school is going through a mid life crisis enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students minds with some thought provoking stuff like think for yourself the principal doesn t agree with her teaching but she is pretty you can connect the dots his teenage daughter is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live she gets some bad advice hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn t being taught at her school shocking seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv this movie plays like a more adult version of an after school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms 
extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novel br br what was even worse was marlon brando s performance his southern drawl was ridiculous i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost brando so great in previous films was reduced here to a laughing stock tyrone power in witness for the prosecution should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here br br the film dealing with racism dealt with the u s government s attempt to avoid marriages between u s soldiers and japanese women br br brando was stone faced throughout the movie his moving from anti these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views br br only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances nothing about either performance was equally impressive umeki s appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka who did nicely as brando s love interest she showed great emotion as the anti american who found love with the brando character her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11 she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living br br martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in the ten commandments to the bigoted mother of brando s love interest at first her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted patricia owens as brando s first love showed depth and conviction in her performance 
bad movie for sure it s such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of poor special effects a lot of hasty scenes and a real unfunny time is awful as the evil guy and he is much better in is doing a non comic joking and i heard that this sunk had already succeed big time success  i ll never understand why or how in one tv interview i ve heard himself when he was nominated for an oscar 2007 regretted it in a comic way  br br one of the comments said well no my friend it s the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of razzie movies all over the years whether it s the 1980s or the 1950s br br there are 2 reasons made me write about this movie the first is that i ll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house wearing just a blue shirt and oh boy the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be but how odd as i ve watched her in following movies and she wasn t that beautiful again  anyhow the second reason is that i ve found this movie s title lately at my list of the worst 100 movies ever br br the bottom line bad movie greeeeeat legs 
well on it s credit side timothy hines did manage to capture the original setting of h g wells outstanding novella but other than that well to call a spade a spade it sucks bigtime what the master ed wood could have done with the alleged 20 million dollar budget timothy hines really does make mr wood who was a flawed genius anyway look like the best filmmaker of all time the special effects are not even up to computer game standards the acting is well perhaps about dinner theater comparable and the accents are atrocious at the risk of sounding offensive a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is well ahem  gay poor ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus english countryside waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor hey the stormtroopers in star wars had neat white body armor too and it didn t work either they still got blasted even when ogilvy and company get fried by the martians heat ray they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance even when they re theoretically dead and reduced to skeletons which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing maybe timothy hines rented the skeletons from ray harryhausen being left over from jason and the argonauts or was it josie and the pussycats i dunno the soldiers presumably because they re military all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him wow i loved it but the soldiers all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war or boer commandos oddly enough the character of the curate looks exactly like he s drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting oh yeah musn t forget the thunder child in the book the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo ram it was meant to ram enemy ships yet it s bow was crumpled after ramming the tinker toy constructed martian war machines with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak and she sank an ironclad warship like thunderchild could ve rammed the titanic and survived but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowest bidder constraints as our own military the costumes are all wrong especially the british army and police uniforms cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas and timbo in an obvious homage to western films of yore has obviously set his movie in wild western england because all his riders are using western saddles the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky on the credit side and contrary to what one reviewer wrote the only genuine authentic feature of this thing is the artillery the guns are not from the civil war but appear to my eye and research as bona fide british nine or 12 pounder rifled breach loaders perfectly authentic to the period so was the ammunition shown being used but the artilleryman who is a driver in the horse artillery was not shown correctly driving his limber you don t sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team you ride the nearside wheel horses the opening using what i believe is authentic period film footage is okay and the score s not bad however to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground and it certainly didn t in 1898 br br but growing up reading this novel i am very disappointed even more disappointed then i was at spielberg s zillion dollar special effects laden version maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise and vice versa i have a lot more to say but i ll let it go at this for now i wish somebody would make a good version of war of the worlds that s faithful to the original timmy s vision is fine for a high school film class or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a college level film student and about as bad which is about the best i can say for this thing but that s about it oh yeah just where did the budget go and what happened to michael caine i d like to hear his comments i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo orson wood hines breathtaking bound breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk taking director s ticket to cult stardom because i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie which i didn t pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me with no malicious intent that i ve been able to determine i must add here that i thought blackmoon s dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement but an absolute hysterically funny treat to watch i find it hard to watch master timbo s version after blackmoon keep it up tim make your own version of dune now it just awaits the hand of a master like you and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield forget it it cannot beat timbo hines artistry for sheer hilarious awfulness hey get a life timbo is worse than the master ed wood i kid you not 
i just didn t get this movie was it a musical no but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it br br was it a serious drama no the acting was not good enough for that br br is whoopi goldberg a quality serious actor definently not br br i had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie the message on apartheid and the tribute to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse br br see for yourself but in fairness i hated it
please be warned this movie though a pretty bad storyline was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen ever just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie br br so it officially begins with a party just your average party but there s some guy there he s pretty into kate if you know what i m saying memorise his face it ll help later br br so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney and so takes the tube that s london underground at the middle of the night but she s just stupid like that so the timetable says the next and last train will come in 7 minutes now kate dumb party girl that she is decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes typically she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground alone well almost br br so the movie just carries on from there blood guts limbs even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body br br in short it s a typical horror pretty but thick damsel in distress type women and sick weird psycho or as the case may have it creep br br i d say give it a go if you re into saw hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much 
the same difficulty i have with the musical version of les miserables applies equally to oliver instead of the composers writing in the stylistic period of the play settings they merely wrote broadway type melodies which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed br br too the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score it s a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste br br the casting of the boy oliver doesn t help matters tentative of timbre and vexingly precious there s something less than solid here fagin performs his traditional routine adequately though the tunes he s obliged to sing have little basis in period manner br br as long as he needs me is given a strident rendition throaty and strained the two big production numbers who will buy and consider yourself seem over produced with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in it s one thing to go all out yet another to cross over the line into excess br br the gloom despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography while the novel is considered a classic i must confess i have trouble with mr dickens consciousness in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life which was full of disappointment and regret br br not all the combined talent of this production either on or behind camera can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material all this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me br br 
when will the hurting stop i never want to see another version of a christmas carol again they keep on making movies with the same story falling over each other in trying to make the movie better then the rest but sadly fail to do so as this is not a good story moralistic old fashioned conservative happy thinking as if people learn the numerous different versions of this film prove that we don t 
probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever badly acted and badly written br br the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll or could it be one of the five characters br br acting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end br br the kills can t really see why they banned this the kills look fake mostly one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive br br overall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
the original movie man from snowy river is one of the best i ve seen nearly perfect a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses rich girl poor boy and ability vs bloodline the sequel however is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous overblown disneyfied mess best summarized as rambo meets the black stallion without the charm of the black stallion the young hero comes back from a 3 year absence and suddenly he s superman on horseback in the original good film he was real and believable but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel i ve hardly been as disappointed in a movie and at times this thing made me quite angry they missed hardly a cliché brazen audience manipulation do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy a mess of a movie 
this film has got several key flaws the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life this means that the film cannot captivate it s audience instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it in short it really is very very very very very very very bad do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe you ll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman 
for anyone craving a remake of 1989 s slaves of new york what are there seven of you here it is was br br this undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters that are in holding patterns the big question seems to be just how long can a young adult remain juvenile it took three people to write this story good god it was easier to come up with citizen kane rather than take viewers back this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene ster in the early 90s br br the idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self absorbed twenty somethings could imagine it the odd sidebar about library work is not the sub plot one expects from the equivalent of parker posey s breakin 2 electric bugaloo her i m serious about graduate school while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical posey s shtick is always amusing but there are projects that are beneath her i was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark 
in what would be his first screenplay based on his own short story turn about william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty sacrifice and really strange relationships the story originally was about only the tone young and cooper characters but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract and faulkner obliged by creating a female role crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co stars young and tone leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph like shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch seriously the almost entirely pronoun less sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry james br br the film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister when young proposes to crawford in tone s presence in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable especially as they go off to their thelma louise fate frankly it s creepy br br not as creepy to this new yorker however as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach wellington which crawford cheerfully catches and young turns into a gladiator blech br br that being said there are some nice performances young is particularly engaging in a scene where he s taken up in cooper s fighter plane and roscoe karns is delightful as cooper s flying buddy tone despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue has a nice moment dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy young s fate crawford stripped of meaningful dialogue as well mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic which is quite a balancing act for one role br br the battle scenes not surprisingly for a howard hawks film are the most exciting part of the entire picture but not enough as far as i m concerned this is 75 minutes of my life i m never going to get back 
just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you ve got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connery s wife and kid in an alligator skinner s shack br br the kind of movie that s probably best seen on a plane and even then only once 
when i was at the movie store the other day i passed up blonde and blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie who knows i mean i m sure most people bashed romy and michelle before they saw it blonde and blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up but when i started watching it executive producer pamela anderson wow i knew i was in for something scary not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness pam anderson and denise richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and they re playing roles that i think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20 s not their 40 s the story was just plain bad and obnoxious br br dee and dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde s they really don t have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world it s just really sad but when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes they are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think they re just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls br br denise and pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before i know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary would i ever recommend this not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens it s more a sign of desperation and blonde and blonder is a huge blonde bombshell br br 1 10
seriously i mean very seriously when i first started watching the show i thought it was good but the plots just got worse the storyline were either too boring or predictable george isn t always funny he sometimes acts stupid his jokes are overdone his mom is the silliest character of the show how can a mother treat her own son that way okay if it was the daughter in law but this was her own son i give this show a 4 10 just because the first few shows were a little funny the actors constance marie and masiela lusha do a great job don t know how these shows get to play for so long br br if you re really bored like i was and have nothing else to watch i d suggest you watch this 
the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear sadly they stopped there they should have continued to make the script disappear then the silly set and finally every visible element of this film because there s nothing else there to show br br gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film i don t really think they exist i think they bought this script at scripts r us where you buy a standard blank monster movie script and just fill in the blanks there s a monster stalking us let s split up hit alien giant bug monster invisible man with crowbar not dead yet burn huge rabbit shark invisible man in unsurvivable fire not dead yet you know the standard stuff even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie were handled badly br br what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie they psychological issues for the subject the deterioration of the mind due to the process treating an invisible subject and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end it would have been a much better movie all in all it stunk br br i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie but i don t want to do any spoilers suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don t think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than 
 you re not going to shoot those little creatures in the first place they haven t done you any harm in the second place they may be radioactive ah the joys of no budget 50s sci fi yet despite the odd gem like that superman and the mole men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58 minute running time it s beyond cheap and pretty dull with it though it has a surprisingly altruistic message the mute mole men diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious merely misunderstood and george reeves man of steel tries to prevent the local small town mob led by jeff corey from killing them an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day perhaps but with little more than good intentions to recommend it 
over christmas break a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings to make the work a bit more difficult a murderous chucks wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm preying on the group in various violent ways br br registered as one of the 74 video nasties listed by the u k in the 1980s the dorm that dripped blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing the term video nasty strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore violence sex etc all the things a horror fan dreams of so after hearing all of that info i settled into pranks expecting a sleazy slasher experience and that s what it tried to be but failed pretty much completely visually the film s not great the cinematography gore and overall direction all fail it s simply not enjoyable to watch the unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason there are some cool death scenes including a pretty nice face melt but that s about it for the positive the acting is pretty bad the story seems unimportant the killer isn t cool or scary and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid it s a bit boring overall for a film done by a few ucla film students for 90 000 the dorm that dripped blood isn t a total mess it has a couple good things and is fairly watchable but as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like the house on sorority row and pieces it just cannot compare don t expect much and you may at least be entertained i hate to say it but this is one of the few films i ve seen that would actually be better with a remake and yet they go after great works like black christmas oh well br br obligatory horror elements br br  subgenre slasher br br  violence gore there are some brutally cool kills and the gore is okay for the most part but nothing special also they off screened some of the best murders br br  sex nudity there s a little unappealing nudity but not very much br br  cool killer nah the ending monologue of the killer made him her pretty uncool br br  scares suspense a jump scare or two but nothing too effective br br  mystery i suppose yeah but i simply didn t care enough and it s as obvious as the nose on the killer s face br br  br br final verdict 3 75 10 bah humbug br br ap3 
what is this crap my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title i decided to watch it with her so she didn t get bored and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality br br first the acting was terrible they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards the delivery is sub par and very formulaic scene cuts were terrible it looks like they took it straight from the story board if there was one br br secondly the jokes and stereotypes weren t original or well played at all again very formulaic i can t count the times i was able to predict the next joke i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly subtle sexual innuendos the cat the beaver patch hung wong c mon just stay away from this movie it s not cute it s not funny it s not even stupid funny it s just stupid stupid it s like a pg kids movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo vulgarity and violence to bump the mpaa rating stay away br br would you like to ride my yacht br br is that what they re calling it now br br you could ride my ding br br oh i think i got blood on my stool br br badly played sir 
i wanted to punch the tv watching it was torture i hated it never watch this movie the terrorists are annoying adam sandler is annoying i normally like him but not in this one i wanted to break the dvd this is the most irritating film in the world the comedian he s jealous of is obnoxious the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone if you even like adam sandler a little bit don t buy it it will just make you hate him do yourself a favor if you see it in the store hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it its a waste of the 1 99 i paid for it 
i can t stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure it s his company but you re fired or you re hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i wouldn t want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve br br i d love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see he s even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i don t have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it i d give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a 1 and it doesn t deserve that 
most definitely the worst columbo ever dreamt up no murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this 
one thing that astonished me about this film was that nathan stoltzfus who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded br br another reviewer said that von trotta said she never meant for lena to bed goebbels but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened why not show other possible reasons for the mens release such as the disaster that was stalingrad or the nazis fear that the international press based in berlin would find out about the protest br br also why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history in places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common br br overall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a little known act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact 
this movie is flawed on many fronts like many before it it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history the production is poor overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares this to me was the greatest flaw i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability intrude br br as a native texan i grew up with the mythology i later learned more about the history i can accept a decent production from either perspective but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it even john wayne s or fess parker s versions had more life than this stolid mess while being only slightly less accurate br br very disappointing avoid it 
i didn t think the french could make a bad movie but i was clearly very wrong as has been said before this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi br br the script is awful pretentious stilted and vapid and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting rather than retelling history along with some fairly decent set design valentina cervi s physical charms are the primary asset of this movie and it s obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development unfortunately the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot and does not sustain this movie the acting is unremarkable and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two the cinematography is ok and there are some pretty colors but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama in any event the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisia s body and all too seldom on her paintings br br all told a near complete failure it s not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film and it s too slow and pretentious to work as soft core pornography so the french can fail after all 
this movie is really goofy i saw it as an 11 year old and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 i really didn t care for it but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of such as 1 does money buy happiness 2 should i lie about things i think they wouldn t approve of 3 does money buy friendships 4 is money everything 5 shouldn t i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me granted these are very unrealistic situations but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children maybe they should watch this video as well in order to show scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt 
i saw and liked the first two a lot really especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first and it s a story standing alone you don t have to know the first movie i liked that in the free willy movies too br br but the third here is absolutely useless i tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two we decided to stop after a good half an hour the movie is okay there are funny parts in it alright but what for timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies what lion king 1 1 2 is for me is a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already plus telling the story from their point of view but what for i d really like to know you know the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one is really nice but what comes after is mostly unnecessary i guess many people liked timon and pumba and so do i really yet for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny no chance most of it wasn t funny at all at least for me btw what was the movie about anyway was it a about timon and pumba or b an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie i tend to choose option b and i m very disappointed about it br br if you like to see stories like the story behind xy you should see rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman that s really funny and no try to get more out of hamlet then it has 
oh dear lord this movie it was horrible i am a huge fan of horror movies and most of the time horror movies other people say are bad i like the actor who played scarecrow was amazing i will say that but this plot was awful it made no sense it had way too much gore and an unnecessary sex scene at the beginning i do believe the director was trying to be shocking or whatnot but it just came out awful to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot the actors we re awful and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who in conclusion this movie made me sick if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway please do 
i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc after 30 minutes i said to him you ve got to be kidding is this some sort of joke he thought it was good i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made what was it supposed to be i asked a propaganda movie made for children the plot is stupid the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life love or even afterlife of which it offers an incredibly idiotic view need some psychiatric help please if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computer it won t destroy your player but it will destroy your evening if they had made razzies in the 40s this would have won in every category 
almost as tedious to watch as it was to read evening is a gorgeously produced failure until meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying br br i was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas it gave me a headache 
this film the alamo thirteen days to glory is utter rubbish the acting is awful it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best it does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long rating out of  
this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema as indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry however it also the worst br br how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage take a look at russia iran china and latin america look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like kisna br br get real people no wonder the international community in general laughs at indian cinema 
1 how is it that everyone can understand each other perfectly without devices like universal translators or translator microbes did the creators of this show realize that people who were taken from different parts of the earth in different time frames speak different languages and can never develop a language so similar to modern day english which has been influenced by latin ancient greek danish and french br br 2 cultural differences can t be overcome so easily trust has to be won yet everywhere the team arrives they are welcomed without any suspicion and start ordering people around like they are their appointed leaders of course real fans would comment that they are perceived as gods the people they meet should be shocked by their technology and accuse them of witchcraft and the like br br 3 historical background none visually it might vaguely remind you of greek or viking culture but anyone can dress in a bunch of tablecloths or run to a local costume rental for a plastic helmet with horns and claim to look the part a small town theater group probably has better props br br 4 boring another lame canuck production which inexplicably ran for ten long years as a kids show it could make the grade but anyone who has a little knowledge about human behavior and language couldn t bear to even watch the first twelve episodes of season 1 like i just did i very much wanted to believe i had found a decent sci fi show otherwise i would shut it of and cleansed my computer of this refuge after the first five minutes 
so where are the cannibals those intrigued by the title and the real cannibal appeal of this film will be let down instead we are shown a strange man and his re visiting of a papua new guinea village full of natives one of whom was his lover several decades prior the man tobias schneebaum is new york jewish as they come and somehow this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes br br there are no real cannibals here only stories relayed by some of the natives and by tobias himself not all together a bad film very interesting and great cinematography schneebaum remains highly likable throughout and provides us with a fascinating glimpse into a life that is about as far removed from western civilization as one can get br br it s just not what it claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary br br 4 out of 10 kids 
warning avoid this super duper awful movie if you watched it you will be sooooooooo disappointed br br pam and denise are grandma age now what are they doing trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy just not working at all pam and denise act so horribly in this movie br br plus the script is absolutely atrocious i can t believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas with the development of movie industry movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this too br br stay away from it i think watch white chicks from 2004 it s so much better that this make no mistake at that time i thought that s the worst movie i have ever seen 
i saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and i was straight up blown away by how bad it was br br first off the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots there are no black or gay new yorkers in love or who say know the self involved white people in love i know it s not the love crash of anvil tastic inclusiveness but you can t pretend to have a cinematic new york with out these fairly prevalent members of society plus you know the people who produced this ish thought crash deserved that ham handed oscar so where is everyone br br possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters this movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst bad acting bad writing bad directing all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants br br but thank god they finally got powerhouses hayden christensen and rachel bilson back together for that jumper reunion and side note uma dodged a bullet ethan hawke looks ravaged this of course is one thing in terms of his looks but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor lovely maggie q br br i had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire but it has to be the anton yelchin olivia thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste which saddens me because i really like those two actors i don t consider myself easily offended but all i could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone s 50 year old aunt br br a close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is shia labeouf s tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former disney channel star to act against julie christie i don t mean opposite i mean against against is the only explanation i realize now that the early sequence with orlando bloom is a relative highlight highlight please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits which seem to be a nod to the first new york real world this film is embarrassing strangely dated inarticulate ineffective pretentious and in the end completely divorced from any real idea of new york at all br br 
to describe this film as garbage is unfair at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby this flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining br br kevin bacon can act superbly given the chance so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay the mad scientist story of hollow man has been told before been told better and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects br br most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies in the uk they were marketed as the transparent man which is maybe where they got the title for this film br br clever special effects dire script non existent plot br br 
i bought this adaptation because i really liked anne brontë s novel when i read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas but i m very disappointed i never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had br br first of all the music seems totally out of place in a period drama and like another commentator i was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors i ve seen some scenes filmed that way in north and south and it seemed all right there but in the tenant it s definitely overdone and simply annoying camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively br br most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity none of the characters were properly introduced at first the little boy gave a very good performance he s very cute and the best feature of the film br br spoilers tara fitzgerald s characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh letting no emotion pass through she doesn t seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way i just couldn t believe markham could have fell for her and i m not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given i could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband fancy being married to such a virago besides he was the only main actor that sounded right to me toby stephens i found just ok helen graham s brother not very good br br maybe it s difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty besides what is only hinted at and left to the reader s imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic and others far too sexed up for a period drama i mean don t we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas 
it was great to see some of my favorite stars of 30 years ago including john ritter ben gazarra and audrey hepburn they looked quite wonderful but that was it they were not given any characters or good lines to work with i neither understood or cared what the characters were doing br br some of the smaller female roles were fine patty henson and colleen camp were quite competent and confident in their small sidekick parts they showed some talent and it is sad they didn t go on to star in more and better films sadly i didn t think dorothy stratten got a chance to act in this her only important film role br br the film appears to have some fans and i was very open minded when i started watching it i am a big peter bogdanovich fan and i enjoyed his last movie cat s meow and all his early ones from targets to nickleodeon so it really surprised me that i was barely able to keep awake watching this one br br it is ironic that this movie is about a detective agency where the detectives and clients get romantically involved with each other five years later bogdanovich s ex girlfriend cybil shepherd had a hit television series called moonlighting stealing the story idea from bogdanovich of course there was a great difference in that the series relied on tons of witty dialogue while this tries to make do with slapstick and a few screwball lines br br bottom line it ain t no paper moon and only a very pale version of what s up doc 
hello i am paul raddick a k a panic attack of wtaf channel 29 in philadelphia let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam sandler s film career but was digitized after a short time br br going overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails or so i thought sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part 1 and rebound the babes were supposed to be engaged but actually they get executed by sawtooth the meanest cannibal the world has ever known adam sandler fared bad in going overboard but fared better in big daddy billy madison and jen leone s favorite 50 first dates man drew barrymore was one hot chick spanglish is red hot going overboard ain t dooley squat end of file 
the premise of the movie has been explained and if you ve gotten this far you don t me to pretend that i m a movie critic with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low i m a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3 and some others br br the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong this is a highschoolers approach to cinema for the rest of us we ll find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis and the acting well hmmm br br if one is a takashi fan you ll see it regardless to peak your interests it lacks any originality or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one br br as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co writing but that doesn t mean much as non of what we d hope would be miike s personality would spill over into the screen all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography br br the movie had the potential to be something great the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with but this one seemed to have been run into the ground br br my suggestion is if you re just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu ichi and audition then movie into his works like blue s harp fudoh rainy dog bird people of china 
please note i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing my review must be read with this in mind br br although i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well this is in many ways a technically poorly made film while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 up through the early to almost the mid 30s a lot of famous french films were essentially silent films with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film the lip movements in many and in particular this film don t even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms brooks could do a french film this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film and as a silent film this is would have been an average film with excellent camera work and some decent silent style acting br br the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot for a silent morality play circa 1920 it would have been fine but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can t handle it she gives it all up temporarily but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end a tad melodramatic huh and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped br br finally the character of the fiancé s friend i found very disturbing and unreal he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean spirited were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused this seems to me that s what is implied and i don t like it at all br br there are far better french films of the era as well as better silent films i just can t understand this film s high rating 
let s see in the st elsewhere finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child newhart ended by telling us that it had all been a dream and roseanne ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind very creative annoying was more like it yes it was just a tv show and wasn t at all reality it s just that when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show you end up at least wanting to believe that it s all real at least as far as the reality it portrays on screen this type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat frustrating and simply not fun to watch now newhart being all a dream at least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show the idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan 
1st watched 2 16 2002 4 out of 10 mystery thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under estimates it s audience the movie going public is not stupid and i hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with we think that this movie is going to be about something with connery s conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard contrived for the audience s sake run of the mill let s never get it over with thriller we are pulled into every silly switch in character as they are portrayed to us when it s needed in the story and we re ready for this thing to be over way before it ends yes there is some good acting here especially from blair underwood fishburne and ed harris in a psycho supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long awaited end 
don t get me wrong the movie is beautiful the shots are stunning and the material is dramatic however it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done br br bbc s planet earth was all of the above and more it was subtle it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death there was tragedy and triumph loss and gain it was balanced br br disney s edit of earth is none of this they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about they made it dramatic they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us they made predators evil they made walruses evil they showed every encounter as negative it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded but at the expense of the lesson of balance the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive br br i am all for preventing global warning but this was over the top political and environmental junk br br that s another thing i went to see it on the big screen but was disappointed in the picture quality it looked better on my tv at home br br if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture go out and buy rent or borrow the bbc s planet earth series it is better lessons better sound and better picture quality 
dude really  where have you guys been the past 20 years this is shocking in all kind of ways horror this is a joke there is nothing wrong with being low budget but this is a laugh if you want to look at the classics freaks of tod browning the victims of dracula and frankenstein the undying monster ernest thesiger paul wegener s the golem and the passengers of the ghost train you can t compare it it gives it a bad name bad acting bad screenplay etc total waist of money and free time have watched a lot of movies were as horror is my all time favorite i really am speechless have nothing more to say that please don t do the effort to watch something so daft please understand
well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean haven t we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i ve seen br br there is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you don t even now who has been killed and who has not the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie br br stay as far away from this movie as possible 
i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons i ve ever seen i did not laugh once throughout this short and it s a bugs bunny cartoon for christ s sake bugs bunny cartoons are always funny not boring alas this short turns out to be good night elmer with the addition of bugs bunny br br the first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff this cartoon on the other hand is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon there s too much dialogue the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue at one point elmer finishes eating dinner and comments that was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb possibly the most redundant dialogue i ve ever heard in a cartoon even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this br br elmer s pet rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me but if you ve sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career you might enjoy it 
with all the excessive violence in this film it could ve been nc 17 but the gore could ve been pg 13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad hairdewed boy friend there was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people the violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this almost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off but the teacher who called him white trash and hoodlum the teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters but was just stabbed in the back there were two suspenseful scenes in the film but didn t last long enough to be scary at all as i said the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off if the gore was actually fun to see then it would ve been nc 17 two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines his stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach though i would ve liked to see that the acting was pathetic characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts i suggest renting this movie for the death scenes i wont see it again anytime soon but i enjoyed the excessive violence also don t bother with the sequel i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death it sounds good but isn t the original scarecrow actually kept me interested 
i finally caught up to starlight last night on television and all i can say is wow it s hard to know where to begin the incredibly hokey special effects the atrocious acting the ponderous dialogue the mismatched use of stock footage or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production this truly is a one of a kind experience and we should all be thankful for that i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood 
i always felt that a good film should have a plot this particular film was missing one and i feel that it would have been more effective with a plot this was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever i was anxious for it to finally end however i just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long it felt like four hours not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict it s not the worst movie i ve seen but i used to say that it was until i saw the fast and the furious so don t think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action i actually hate most action films out today it s just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum not much really happens in this movie however the scenery and costumes were nice 
caught this on ifc yesterday and can t believe the positive reviews am i the only one who thought these ladies were anything but kate tells jed she could get fired because she s supposed to be a pillar of the community but puts out for him then they suddenly decide they re in love and she s so devastated over his death she doesn t go to his funeral much less tell his family the good news by the way how did an american get to be the headmistress of a very proper british school janine should have been kicked off the force for her inexcusable abuse of power but nothing happens and she winds up boffing a con she brought in for questioning and the less said about molly the better br br as for the guilt janine and molly feel over jed please it s the punk s own damn fault he got turned into roadkill where s the guilt over poor gerald who gets puked on if only i could do the same to the bozos behind this movie 
here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film a sub genre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so i ve heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie and as much as i hate to be redundant the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything the punch bowl over poor jeremy s head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie but that s just a suggestion br br the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning she gets killed people wonder in the old oh but that stuff only happens to other people tone and then they start to get killed the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful but they have no idea how to do it take jason for example here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated he is assumed to carry some significance besides that and more importantly he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentine s day cards br br it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects and jason is a perfect example of the effort but not such a good example of a successful effort sure i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer but that s not the point we know from early on that he is terrible with women which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film but then in the middle of the film he appears at a party smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls and then gives them a hateful look and walks away disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation we already know he is a cardboard character but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him br br on the positive side the killer s true identity was in fact made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also unfortunately yet another rip off early in the film when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel he makes no sound suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female rather than a male as everyone suspects but then for the rest of the film we just have this stolid relentless unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife director jamie blanks mentions being influenced by halloween this is of course completely unnecessary because it s so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyer s is that michael s mask was so much more effective and he didn t have a problem with nosebleeds this stuff is shameless br br at the end there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is but then we see adam s nose start to bleed as he holds kate his often reluctant girlfriend and we know that he s been the killer all along nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film valentine is not scary and the characters might be possible to care about if it weren t so obvious that they were just going to die i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews but the end result is the same old thing 
i ve never been to paris but after seeing paris je t aime i m crazy to visit this city i ve been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs i kinda expected to be touched by this film to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away but lo and behold i regret the time and money i spent with it there are no love stories between people or a person and the city there s a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn t work out fine maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city where it s said to have thousands of people living on their own can t you find love in new york 
i just got the uk 4 disc special edition of superman 1 for about 5 the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole men so i slapped it into the dvd player last night and here are my findings br br some initial disappointment i hadn t checked and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials i m not a huge fan of george reeves as superman and i hadn t seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn but hey ho never mind br br this black and white production runs for less than an hour it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves early tv series a two parter put together for cinema release although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series in any event it s an odd choice for reasons i ll get to later i m of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets so there were no major surprises here even so for a low budget movie this one is really low budget br br the story concerns the small town of silsby population 1 430 which puzzlingly is also home to the world s deepest oil well the story opens with the well s foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well at the behest of the oil company as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down a couple of odd little guys emerge from the capped off drillshaft and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces br br a deep breath now here is the remaining plot of the picture the little guys scare some kids so jeff corey incites some pals to kill these creatures superman steps in and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital corey s pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed but he escapes and legs it down the shaft corey incites a lynch mob to hang the hospitalised mole man superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows a total of 4 mole men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey and superman saves him he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved the mole men go back down the shaft the end br br despite the film only being an hour long there is an inordinate amount of creeping around bewareing and pursuing i have left out all the mole man 1 creeps from a to b looking out to make sure no one is following him stuff the mole men are never engaged in any way whatsoever they have no dialogue they just turn up get persecuted and go back they do look a little creepy but they are hardly the bug eyed monsters that the town s reaction implies br br reeves is quite a good clark kent very much a hard nosed reporter much more so than phyllis coates rather indifferent lois lane but he is a terrible terrible superman not only does he not look the part the way he plays it is all wrong in my book i m sure he was told to strike the pose but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips not fists on ribs and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher he doesn t actually wag his finger in remonstration but he may as well have done br br and superman does a huge amount of walking around and a bit of running he takes off and lands a couple of times but isn t seen in flight at any point oh some bullets bounce off him and he uses telescopic vision as clark but with no accompanying visual effect in fact visual effects are conspicuous by their absence and the few which are present aren t very good br br i ve tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time but even by those standards i think it s a pretty threadbare effort thankfully production standards on the tv series were higher and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them br br something of a disappointment i shan t be watching it again 
for the first couple of seasons i thought the apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show the combination between reality tv and a 16 week job interview was innovative and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too out there br br the new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business at all in the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business related tasks now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show the boardroom can be entertaining to watch but it s entertainment at it s low point sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old jerry springer episode the tasks on the show are at most boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay nbc for the publicity and what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6 that is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real life br br i have absolutely no respect for any of the contestants this season they all seem like idiots to me in earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show it also seems like donald trump s massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest i can t see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him his rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn t make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it s worth br br r i p the apprentice please nbc for god s sake get the show off the air as soon as possible it s just too embarrassing to watch the apprentice was once a great tv show but now it s just a big fat joke 
the london underground has something inherently creepy about it with its long winding tunnels the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground and of course the rats roaming the tracks it a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep br br i thought the film started off well with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london however creep went downhill from here and i found myself wishing that i d switched it off after this opening scene leaving me with a favourable impression of the film all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable even potente herself and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness he also made the mistake of showing the monster in full lighting where he ceases to become remotely scary and reveals his name to be craig how can you have a monster called craig it turns into an x files type thing and reminds one of the episode tombs in fact i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me br br as for the infamous sexualised violence it is very graphic disturbing and totally unnecessary it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror which is a mistake as it s only halfway through the film br br so there you go the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell one of my favourite occasional actors you don t see him very often but when he s on screen he acts everyone else into a corner casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius unfortunately the only one evident in the film 
if you ve ever seen this movie you d know that it if you haven t and want to see a classic bad movie i suggest you see this movie because it ranks right down with the worst so if you re really bored go rent it if you want to know what it s like here s my little summary adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people adam doesn t like how one passenger is getting all the babes and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes but wait it only gets worse you ll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is 
just cause showcases sean connery as a harvard law prof kate capshaw as his wife and lawrence fishburne as a racist southern cop and ed harris in a totally over the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer br br weird casting but the movie plays serious mindf with the audience first of all i felt myself rolling my eyes repeatedly at the liberal stereotypes the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy with no evidence the coroner witnesses and even the lawyer of the accused collaborate against him because he is black br br connery is a harvard law prof who gives impassioned speeches about the injustices against blacks and against the barbarous death penalty he is approached by the convicted man s grandmother to defend him and re open the trial br br connery is stonewalled by the small town officials and the good il boys club but finds that the case against blair the alleged killer now on death row was all fabricated the main evidence was his confession which was beaten out of him br br the beating was administered by a black cop who even played russian roulette to get the confession out of him connery finds out that another inmate on death row actually did the murder and after a few tete a tetes with a seriously overacting hannibal lecter like ed harris he finds out where harris hid the murder weapon br br he gets a re trial and blair is freed br br i think film over  br br then suddenly it turns out that blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used white guilt to enlist connery he concocted the story with ed harris in return for blair carrying out a few murders for harris br br now blair is on the loose again thanks to connery s deluded pc principles the final 30 min are a weird action movie tacked onto a legal drama connery and fishburne fighting the serial killer in an alligator skinning house on stilts in the everglades br br that was one weird film br br so the whole system is corrupt and inefficient the cops are all just bullies and abu graib type torturers but the criminals are really psychotics and deserve to fry br br truly depressing on every level the system is completely rotten and the pc white guilt types who challenge it are seriously deluded too br br two thumbs down connery obviously had to make a mortgage payment or something 
the worst movie i have seen in a while yeah its fun to fantasize but if that is what you are looking for i suggest you see brewsters millions this was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny unless you are five or like terrible movies don t see this one 
well you know the rest this has to be the worst movie i ve seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role br br the lead role is played by a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey br br bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70 s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this can t disguise the fact that the lady doesn t know how to throw a punch an average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing br br sorry the only mystery on show here is how this didn t win the golden raspberry for its year 
this is really a new low in entertainment even though there are a lot worse movies out br br in the gangster drug scene genre it is hard to have a convincing storyline then you would also need a setting of character relationships that is believable br br sure tristan is drawn away from his family but why was that again what s the deal with his father again that he has to ask permission to go out at his age interesting picture though to ask about the lack and need of rebellious behavior of kids in upper class family but this movie does not go in this direction even though there would be the potential judging by the random backflashes wasn t he already down and out why does he do it again br br so there are some interesting questions brought up here for a solid socially critic drama br br it wants to be a drama to not glorify abuse of substances and violence but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie with an average set of actors and a vinnie jones who is managing to not totally ruin what s left of his reputation by doing what he always does br br so all in all i just  can t recommend it br br 1 for vinnie and 2 for the editing 
maybe you shouldn t compare but wild style and style wars are original hip hop beat street does have a lot of the original artists of early hip hop but they ve been obviously made clear that this could be their big break of course for some it was and that s nice but if you view this as original hip hop culture you re wrong it s overproduced and has a hollywood sauce rather look for the first two movies i mentioned they have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto yes the rating for this movie is low but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving this is probably because although the story the acting the dialogues and the direction all are dreadful the music and dancing is what the people love about it me i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of hip hop and i still don t like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it doesn t work for me i mean wild style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic of course tastes differ and that s alright but as far as i m concerned this movie is trash except for the break dancing and some of the music and so i can t rate it higher than a 4 out of ten 
i saw this film on its release and have watched it 3 or 4 more times including last week i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr branagh s performance br br this is really a glorious sumptuous film to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long beautifully shot and designed derek jacobi julie christie kate winslet richard briers and many others do fine jobs then there s kenneth branagh if ever there was a vanity project for an actor this is it and mr branagh spares nothing in putting the ham in hamlet from the stunt casting to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of naturalness to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others his performance confirms that while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary he has never been a great film actor the scenery budget could be charged to catering mr branagh eats so much of it his performance is a perfect example of why people don t go to see shakespeare full of sound and fury signifying nothing and if there is fault to his direction it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance br br no matter what theories people may posit on the bard he was after all is said and done a playwright the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless although there is no right way to play his plays there is most certainly great acting good acting and bad acting shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of hamlet itself it amazes me how mr branagh mouthed it but did not hear it it was an example of spending too much time working out how he s going to say something and too little figuring out what he s saying br br while mr branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it his direction has always been better than his acting i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare he set a great template for other productions and it would be interesting to see him onstage from about 20 rows back but i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less br br is it worth seeing certainly there are many little joys to be found in the film but it s a long long movie and by the end one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it 
this movie is basically about some girls in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on the girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved she becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened the other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell the deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just can t put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that the best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene i admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind this movie reminds me of the low budget thriller blood song with frankie avalon staring in it the same motive just a different character part it s not a movie worth renting not even for an 80 s low budget movie and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back 
holy this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with i tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen i rank this well below anything i have ever watched on film or tv and thats saying something i once witnessed a cow crap in a field i watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half who knows it might have moved or something well that was time better spent than watching this tripe the acting was non existent the plot was somewhere other than on this film i think i saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to portland in hopes of becoming a steven king shi77er please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs it s pretty clear he needs heavy medication and i d willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal bah i can t give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this chilton on the rack walk to your car start the engine then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can t feel your bones vibrate anymore be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway you might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself br br by the way i watched this after a buddy of mine sent his girlfriend over so i could see it he dint come over she had too whats worse is that she had to watch this thing twice i heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month i hope it was because of this film 
my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video although it had great actors actresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest plus it just wasn t that interesting dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn s last movies i ll always love john ritter best in slapstick he was just too pathetic here 
warning this review contains spoilers do not read if you don t want some points revealed to you before you watch the film br br with a cast like this you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into did they see the script and say hey close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one can t fail unfortunately it does did they even think to check on the director s credentials i mean would you do a movie with the director of a movie called satan s cheerleaders greydon clark who would later go on to direct the infamous final justice made this it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer final justice and completely miss out on the return br br the film is set in a small town in new mexico a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam er a spaceship appears and hovers over them in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film the ship spews some kind of red ink on them it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it so right away you are treated with cheese anyhow the ship leaves and the adults don t believe the children elsewhere we see vincent schiavelli whom i find to be a terrific actor who is playing a prospector or as i called him the miner 1949er he steps out of the cave he is in and he and his dog are inked by the ship twenty five years go by and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd who works with her father raymond burr in studying unusual weather phenomena or something like that shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town and she travels there to research it once she gets there the local ranchers harass her and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on and deputy jan michael vincent comes to her rescue from this point on the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other especially after vincent wards off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty five years earlier while this boring mess is happening vincent schiavelli with his killer dog at his side is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick or treaters at halloween the kind that you shake to make them glow schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people it s the second worst effect in the movie every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick the scene s atmosphere suddenly turns dark like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is br br and what does all this lead up to it s hard to tell when the final confusing scene arrives see burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of calling card but none of it makes sense why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead but even that doesn t make much sense when you really think about it i mean why doesn t he kill jan michael vincent after all he had twenty five years to do it and the aliens won t need him if shepherd is dead anyhow so why try to kill her speaking of the aliens it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent what is their goal why do they wait so long to intervene how could they be so sure shepherd would come back not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made the return any more pleasant you would still have bad lines really bad acting particularly by shepherd cheesy effects and poor direction luckily the stars escaped from this movie cybill shepherd soon went on to star in moonlighting with bruce willis jan michael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of b movies often in over the top parts raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films martin landau who played a kooky law enforcement officer quickly made the terrific alone in the dark and the awful the being before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to the return zantara s score 2 out of 10 
the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery this movie was long and boring the minister should have retired from the pulpit the time his son paul strayed from the teachings he proclaimed how many times can his boys take the lord s name in vain in this film being from a presbyterian background it doesn t fit i wished paul was swept down the river without a boat at the very beginning to spare us the silly smirkish selfish story of paul so norm becomes a teacher and paul becomes a compulsive gambler who norm wants to rescue but doesn t so what it s very uninteresting we see the prejudiced whites being stood up to by paul because of his native american girl that was the only part that had some interest and maybe could have been developed into a real wild western what we only see is a sleepy town where the two minister s sons have nothing to do but 1 norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2 paul make up dumb stories at the newspaper shop while scratching his head and take a lot of swigs and tie a lot of flies i d rather watch a show about fishing that that film again which will be never 
well well one cant b wasting time just cause of a big star cast i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who some pathetic songs that will be heard by who some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who race against time u mean waste against time ok so first you spoil your kid then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i cant waste my time writing about waste anyway 
 br br lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to me br br gothic lesbians get invited to a count s island castle for the weekend one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around br br it s not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit go figure br br dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo this is one snoozer br br pretty boring 2 out of 10
this video nasty was initially banned in britain and allowed in last november without cuts br br it features the playboy playmate of the month october 1979 ursula buchfellner the opening cuts back and forth between buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures i am not sure what the purpose of that was it would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene br br laura is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom peter is sent to find her and the ransom of course one of the kidnappers manages to pass the time productively while another whines incessantly br br the ransom exchange goes to hell and laura runs into the jungle will peter save her before the cannibals have a meal oh yes there are cannibals in this jungle why do you think it was a video nasty muriel montossé is found by peter and his partner on the kidnapper s boat montossé is very comfortably undressed peter leaves them and goes off alone to find laura who has been captured by now they pass the time having sex and don t see the danger approaching guts anyone great fight between peter and the naked devil br br blood decapitation guts lots of full frontal some great writhing by the cannibal priestess and the line they tore her heart out which is hilarious if you see the film 
after we counted the use of the f word oh about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together well we turned it off relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie the product of unimaginative and no talent writers br br we did give it a second chance thinking surely it would get better no dice later my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved still no dice br br the main character did have a cool bike br br i wouldn t recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents or frat boys 
i had never heard of this adam sandler movie until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster being an adam sandler fan at the time i rented it honestly i could only watch about 30 mins of it it was terrible do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon and i hope it stays that way 
scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers fellow students alike the poor kid suffers daily humiliation bullying teasing general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers unfortunately he doesn t find much support at home since his mom is a slut after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field strangles the poor kid however something magical happens lester s spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him made his life hell br br co written co produced directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr duforq although i don t remember any character of this name i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of it s terrible reputation i have to say it pretty much well deserved since it s terrible the script by itier bill cunningham jason white uses the often told story of one of life s losers who gets picked upon tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick we ve seen it all before we ve seen killer scarecrows before we ve seen faceless teens being killed off one by one before we ve seen one of life s losers get his revenge before we ve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before we ve seen incompetent small town sheriff s make matters even worse before the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether it s any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level the answer is a resounding no to be honest the film has terrible character s awful dialogue an inconsistent predictable story it has some cheesy one liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask s can you dig it  the so called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn t that exciting the kills are forgettable you know i m still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed killed with a stick of corn br br director itier doesn t do a particularly good job here the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there s never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off also i m not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back flips somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix or some japanese kung fu flick to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one liners twirl around a bit don t you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring i know he s a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day there s no nudity the gore isn t anything to write home about there s a decapitation someones face is burnt someone is killed with a stick of corn someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat some sickles are stuck in people s heads someone has their heart ripped out someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth br br with a supposed budget of about 250 000 this was apparently shot in 8 days well at least they didn t waste any time on unimportant things like story character development technically this is pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing the acting sucks the guy who played lester s mum s bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous don t get me started on his accent br br scarecrow has a few fun moments the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made badly acted silly too predictable very cheesy if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows not to be confused with the gene hackman al pacino film scarecrow or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow which is currently in production scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels scarecrow slayer scarecrow gone wild 
live yes but not kicking br br true story some time ago a dutch tv station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show a contest rather the main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure for real br br the country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd saying it was appalling immoral what is this world coming to and the like in a way i had to agree br br as the months passed the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not instead of running the country br br the show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead and up to the last moment the country was up in arms the prime minister making speeches every newspaper writing about it everyone in the country holding their breaths and the network pushed on towards a new frontier in television and they definitely succeeded in doing just that they pushed the envelope br br the show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live whilst she would die shortly after br br and then in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax the woman was not ill but all the candidates were there was no kidney auction the whole show that with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions built up for months to a fantastic climax was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors the man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease br br now this is television leaving everybody far behind in amazement br br don t give me a poorly acted poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian roulette show on american tv br br as if br br spoiler as if i m going to believe they would get this through the fcc as if i m going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression as if i m gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air br br it s all been done before watch running man with arnold instead at least it had a semi good ending br br spoiler this is an appallingly bad piece of film together with a ridiculous ending so she gets shot in the end is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice don t take my word for it but i would say this leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead you ll get more quality 
i am going to keep this short this adaption of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and as a result this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top 250 br br jack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvall the story that has nothing to do with the book is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes br br my advice to anyone that hasn t read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story stick to the tv series br br oh and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is not a good writer should stick to reviewing masterpieces like eyes wide shut 
for those who d like to see this movie i d say go without the narration it might be a very good movie documentary but the music the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it very hard to watch for a sceptic person like me following several animals their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we re watching but the melodramatic point of view just doesn t cut it for me moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey the camera zooms out or skips to another scene i ask myself why that happens if they were to show reality why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd cause after all it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet 
this movie is one of the most awful movies ever made how can jon bon jovi play in a movie he is a singer not an actor what is he killing vampires with his guitar and what about the dreadful plot o my god this movie really sucks in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover surrounded by an army of vampires but when the fantastic slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left what happened with the other 10 15 vampires they run out in the sun and what about the grand finally when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun that s really a not in buffy the vampire slayer in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun this really is a lack of originality 
holy freaking god all freaking mighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing i ve seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the g strings imho most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage and you can tell there s no horse they re fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub par to 1992 s beyond the mind s eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever 
when i ordered this from blockbuster s website i had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was who knows maybe i d forgotten to take my add meds that day i do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon donned in their late 70 s style wide collars bell bottoms and feathered hair i knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster br br the first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe forcing polyester and porno quality music on the would be viewer from the opening scene with the poorly done effects to the monsters from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of the vagina monologues br br throughout the film the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear the ship was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old vcr and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path of course if moved slower than bob barker s impacted bowels but it had menacing pencil thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two br br moving on as the weirdness and bell bottoms continue we found out that they re caught in a space time warp how do we garner this little nugget of scientific information because the oldest male lead tells his son that in a more or less off the cuff fashion like reminiscing about how you won the big game over a cup of joe or an ice cold bottle of refreshing coca cola was pops a scientist nope but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and einstein s theories br br the recording i watched on dvd was almost bootleg quality the sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone other than that it was really really really bad br br i know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics i never saw this film on its original release but even back then i think i would ve come to the same conclusion bury this one quick 
loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the it deserved even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made for tv columbo film ever i m glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print 
there s not a drop of sunshine in the sunshine boys which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simon s sole ironic moment simon who adapted the script from his play equates old age with irrational behavior and worse clumsy galumphing mean spirited irrational behavior walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special burns who won a supporting oscar has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back the noisier the movie gets the less tolerable and watchable it is director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasn t coupled with one of neil simon s screenplays here ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off at this point matthau was still too young for this role and he over compensates by slouching and hollering it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character to nuance his temperament to give the sunshine boys some sunniness yet walter continues to project as if we d all gone deaf the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace one loses hope for it early on 1 2 from  
okay now what the hell is this supposed to be is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg s close encounters of the third kind or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as when dinosaurs ruled the earth and the lost world perhaps it s an intellectual philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend yes that must be it whatever it is the creators of the day time ended must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres the story doesn t make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but hey who cares as long as it s got papier mâché dinosaurs miniature spacecrafts headache inducing light laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas the voice over introduction is practically inaudible but no worries as it s all gibberish did you know that the definition of time isn t what we all think it is time doesn t necessarily pass by chronologically it is one giant paradox words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us i have absolutely no idea what all this means but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap dancing midget aliens and well mannered dinosaurs on screen together i deliberately say well mannered dinosaurs because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar powered house in the middle of nowhere grandpa is extremely annoying the granddaughter even more granny is a walking talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is  incredibly hot chris mitchum for some reason also pointless wanders around the filming sets as the hot mommy s husband on business travel the special effects are purely cheesy and absolutely laughable but the absolute most genius aspect here are the dialogs just read this wondrous example of extraordinary writing br br grandpa you know what this is don t you this is a time space warp br br stevie i m not quite sure if i know what that means dad br br grandpa well i guess nobody really does br br make up your mind gramps do you know what it is or don t you and stop talking about the vortex like you re some kind of expert in the field the day time ended is an incredibly childish and not worth bothering for fantasy movie though i can totally understand that some of its fans cherish the film because they saw it at young age and became fascinated with the flamboyant effects the ending completely comes out of nowhere like they suddenly ran out of money or like the effects of the mushrooms they were eating wore out unexpectedly 
this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling br br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don t expect a story there isn t one 
 of course there s spoilers  i m sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies female protagonist check bad things happen to drug takers check heorine knocks out villain check heroine doesn t notice villain recovering unconsciousness check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here in fact there s so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he s been killing people on the underground i m led to believe it s the result of some human experiment and perhaps it s not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they d be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and there s always a market for horror movies likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it s slightly better than 1972 s death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground it s just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head
as the number of video nasties i ve yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when i saw it was available br br the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets a significant cut he s brought a helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors ever granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour now this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever ping pong balls for eyes and that s pretty much it his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and i found myself muting much of those scenes br br oh did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity this is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out but it s not a redeeming factor for gore fans also jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close ups of female genitals and sadly male as well so if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got it br br i can t recommend this trash to anyone it s not even the good bad movie it s just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true 
there was nothing of value in the original movie this one was even lamer the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing anyone connected to this film has to be high on something so what was the story line what was with the girl was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film sadly i tried several times to watch this i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback kid said it was stupid and he was four years old i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film that might be pushing it i did love the theme song good thing it was only a dollar it was worth it i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be is pot legal in france 
this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business the idea that audiences paid to see this movie is discouraging also br br obsessed teacher kills teenager s family because he wants her for no reason he kills the mother father and brother from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison hmm usual bad writing no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around sniff out people and with a knife is super killer sure now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason knifes bellhop for the fun of it and starts to hunt down the teenager s friends now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel again it is stupid ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them now he kills two cops outside teenager s house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend br br there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage if any other profession put out work of this low quality they would be fired yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash 
holy crap this was the worst film i have seen in a long time all the performances are fine but there is no plot really no plot a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that s your film ug robert duvall s character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over this earns him the same responses over and over i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it good performances with famous and well regarded actors but the actual complete work is a steamy turd well maybe that s a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens sack
well what can you say about sitcoms there often quite lame morale dedicative and just plain so is this show it got a boring cast although a bynes is okej in her perky way the rest is just stereotypical crap as always we have all seen it before and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled cause lets face it its a mediocre and self righteous show as the most sitcoms are  br br well in short if you wanna see some good entertainment you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror do some faces and move on  its more entertaining than this show 
assuming this won t end up a straight to video release i would have to say void this title at all costs unless you re bored of good well executed movies that is i saw this last night at afi dallas and i left with 20 minutes remaining simply because i didn t care anymore when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie things are going to bad let s just say this is only an indicator of things to come unfortunately br br i ll spare you all the details but this is sub par in every manner even the half assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you re expecting half assed acting from him and the rape scene christ shut up and take it should never be used in a rape scene ever br br 3 10
 possible spoiler br br return to cabin by the lake is a useless movie the acting was not good and the plot wasn t even remotely interesting br br cabin by the lake is a good tv movie the sequel was not judd nelson was very good in the first film and put a whole lot more into his character than in this it seemed as if he wasn t even interested in doing the sequel his acting was good but it could have been better i really don t want to comment on the rest of the cast because in my opinion they re not even worth mentioning but i ll do it the character of alison isn t even hardly shown in the first part of the film all of a sudden she s the center of attention next to stanley caldwell the role didn t make sense and it should have been thought out a little better dahlia salem was absolutely terrible her acting was way below decent and the casting people should have looked for somebody else anybody else the director mike was a confusing character he seemed to have a purpose for being there but it didn t seem like his death was necessary the acting for this role was good nothing great but better than salem s br br the plot was real lousy if you think about it stanley who is presumed dead makes his way onto the set of cabin by the lake the movie based on his script he stumbles upon the director and in a short time the director is dead and stanley is running the show yeah out of nowhere the crew is just going to let this stranger come into the picture and finish the film not knowing anything about him there s some killings not a whole lot and the one s that are shown are ridiculous one of the actresses on the set gets electrocuted while filming a scene another character gets chewed up by a motorboat and one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning these writers must have been hard up for excitement br br i just have to say that i was not impressed with the filming of the movie the way that it kept changing from looking low budget back to normal started to become irritating very fast also the new cabin by the lake was poorly created we aren t shown it but only in a few scenes and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless it worked in the first film only because we were shown the room a lot more but it didn t work in this one br br there were too many characters in this sequel all of them except for a few had no reason to be there the acting of what little is showed was really bad and they just didn t have a purpose in this movie br br all in all return to cabin by the lake is a sequel picking up from where the first left off cabin by the lake i can take but this was just not impressive judd nelson should have avoided this one and so should you it s nothing like the first and it went entirely too slow nothing happened in the first hour and it continued to drag on for the second not to mention that the writing was horrible put this on only if you need some help getting to sleep br br so we see that stanley defies death and is still alive and well by the way he talks it sounds like there could be a possible third installment to a movie good just by itself quit throwing in sequels and we may be alright br br br br 
towards the end of this thriller ally sheedy s gaunt latter day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image she convinces one that if a nasty bette davis type role were to come her way she could carry it off brilliantly unfortunately i can t find many other reasons for seeing this if you ve wondered what sheedy looks like in a pair of old fashioned glasses then here s your answer for the rest sally kirkland s sex starved crazy woman is really tiresome and even if you like this sort of thing more than i do you ll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes savage s drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it s a small role of the leading actors nicholas walker inspires no sympathy at all for paul keller s plight and his acting is wooden dara tomanovich is better and during her scenes with sheedy the level rises a little sheedy s meticulous understated performance is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest the sets are drab the camera work undistinguished 
save the 8 97 you ll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg br br i m a filmmaker and being an avid fan of h g wells i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment instead it took four days to finish watching this because i couldn t stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time it s horrible br br there are reports that timothy hines had a 20 million budget for this production where the heck did it go did he use most of it to buy a new house finance his retirement or what let me start with what is actually good about this film it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible and i do mean horrible special effects any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi to me most of it looked like stop action card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a 20 million project should be using br br there s no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than 1500 00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created i ve seen films with budgets of less than 2 million look better much better br br in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines special effects in this film in fact i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film there s no excuse with today s technology for a film to look like a 50 s b movie unless that was the intention which shouldn t have been with this particular project br br a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky another demonstration of amateur film making br br overall i have to say that i produced a 45 000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film br br i strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film making or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead it would be easier on the eyes 
this was an awful movie not for the subject matter but for the delivery i went with my girlfriend at the time expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression with no uplift at the end the previews and ads made no mention of this plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes again the previews say nothing about this if i had known how depressing this movie would be i would ve never have seen it or at least i would ve been prepared for it this was a bait and switch ad campaign and i will never see this movie again 
it s been about 14 years since sharon stone awarded viewers a leg crossing that twisted many people s minds and now god knows why she s in the game again basic instinct 2 is the sequel to the smash hit erotica basic instinct featuring a sexy stone and a vulnerable michael douglas however fans of the original might not even get close to this one since instinct 2 is painful film making as the mediocre director michael caton jones assassinates the legacy of the first film br br the plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning catherine tramell is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder a psychiatrist is appointed to examine her but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction br br and there it is without no further explanations the basic force that moves this instinct nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy c class erotic film sharon stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn off part of it because of the amateurish writing the careless direction and terrifyingly low chemistry the movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality than the first entrance in the series instinct is a compelling torture br br to top it off everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film the acting here is really bad sharon stone has some highlights but here she gets extremely obnoxious david morrisey stars in the worst role of his life and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie confused and aroused instinct 2 is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well paul verhoeven how i miss you  br br basic instinct 2 never sounded like a good movie and indeed it isn t some films should never get out of paper and that is the feeling you get after watching this now it is much easier to understand why douglas and david cronenberg dropped out and why sharon stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this   3 10
it as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy it is not only oppressively preachy but absurd stagebound dramatically straight jacketed and painfully overwrought watching it one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write i will not become a fascist on the blackboard 100 times br br now i understand that it was made during the height of ww2 and was intended to be a brave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about and i m sure it accurately captured the mood of the day but it is presented in such an immature over obvious sledgehammer way it fails abysmally as a work of art br br the only good performances here are from paul lukas who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti fascist and lucile watson as the amusingly ill mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well behaved little snips they do not even remotely resemble real human beings and bette davis a great actress here is so one dimensionally noble i cringed every time she was on screen her every word her every gesture is meant to convey how supportive and understanding she is of the sacrifices her husband has to make and the great cause he is fighting for that she must ve been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal br br so yes this is a very important film just not a very good one 
when a man who doesn t have alzheimer s can t remember how many films he s made he probably is the world s most prolific director after all that man is jesus franco the king of so called eurotrash his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed opaque stupid lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word as any other franco film i ve seen that makes it sound pretty awful and it is yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility a generous way with the baldly outrageous with nudity and sleaze and violence and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out even while you re mostly waiting for them to end because they re so very tedious br br devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america there s lots of naked writhing dancing and endless repeated zoom ins on an ugly totem pole you need to get used to the repetitive zoom ins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away as these are franco s main methods of extending a film out to feature length br br the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning apparently recorded in an echo chamber early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree and it s hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach br br anyway the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers the flakey guy has an accent which as dubbed is half brooklyn american half english liverpudlian and all retarded all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest br br not too much really happens from here on in and it happens pretty sluggishly studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape the nebulous action is fleshed out by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads and even from the monster himself that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero but it s gotta be done at some point and it s nice to note that the director will show anyone s genitals on camera br br the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of film making but he doesn t muck around with sets you get real islands jungles helicopters and mountains all in widescreen this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam br br ultimately issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot if you re trying to see all the video nasties you will have to watch this at some point and you ll be made as restless as i was if you like franco you ll watch this anyway if you fall into neither of the above categories the odds are you ll never come across this film copies of it aren t just lying around and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it it s franco lazy crazy franco 
the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i ve seen in my life the plot is slow and lacking the acting is borderline comical while i love paul muni i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice the only saving grace i found with this film is it s production value the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment also the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film 
 my dissatisfaction is split 30 tone deafness 70 lackluster writing br br the 30 i agree with the first commenter s synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories i was surprised how this film at best woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it s inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl a few minority characters are written into the stories but they are included by obligation while we can see the gears under the film so clearly striving to be diverse but falling ever so short br br the 70 is why everything falls short all characters white plus a few token minorities are one dimensional cardboard cutouts of people concepts worse their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what i d say is a gag we get a basic conceit then some punchline intended to be a clever twist but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say okay that was a surprise the stories are still not that interesting because they too are shallow when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending you re writing jokes br br spoilers below br br the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories that s fine but romance is amazing deep sometimes complex these romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other words exchange thoughts are projected through voice over but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another br br meaning there is no seduction no tension and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other the only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy gets outwitted by the girl he s hitting on who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker sure his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we d be if we were next to them but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of a then b so it unfolds if something like a postcard could unfold with all the other tales as well a then b that s it the only point being that these happen to occur on set in manhattan by the way the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village br br it s easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race gender sexual orientation and so on _ new york i love you _ however deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title we expect to see the real new york and real new yorkers but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic its characters flown in from the o c plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity but when we look closer at who those characters are the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent br br for example the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny when in fact he s the father notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic construction point of view it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl s father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer what the dad can t be just some guy from south america now that he s obviously hot is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle to upper class white woman are we that naive as to require such as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable br br it s not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone but in every conceivable set up and plot twist the direction taken screams status quo appeals to safety all these stories could have been made more interesting even if we were forced to keep the single dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy how bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead again i m not saying the entire conceit has to be changed it s just that every damn story premise is so hackneyed and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york outside the trite the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading br br i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack the good pacing of the movie and the general feel of many of the scenes the movie was just fine to sit through and i wouldn t dissuade anyone from doing so however it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non superficiality is when the old opera singer says that s what i love about new york everyone s from a different place well you wouldn t know it from watching this one 
i have to congratulate the genius who approved this one edward furlong you re not as good as you think mate you can t grab on every piece of low cost amateur crap which sole intention has to be to get some bucks br br the filming is bad and i mean bad anyone with a camera would get the same result or better br br the acting lets just say don t go to the supermarket looking for actors the good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience the director mr jon keeyes please find your purpose in life as a director you simply suck your directing is poor the angles are all messed up the lines seem as if they re being read out of toilet paper and the damn music it always comes up when it shouldn t and goes out for no apparent reason and don t go for writer either by the way making movies isn t like serving on a coffeshop it requires art and skill things i really doubt you ll ever have br br instead of making a badass shootout movie you should ve shot this one back to oblivion and wait till something good came up or just go find a job on a coffeshop you ll have less stress and you ll save movie goers some money and a bad night br br vote 1 10 
never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films bob fosse s star 80 about dorothy stratten of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low life husband is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen patty hansen is no actress either i expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god awful poodlesque hair do very disappointing  paper moon and the last picture show i could watch again and again this clunker i could barely sit through once this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms stratten s tawdry death i think the real reason was because it was so bad 
for the record this film is intriguing but its hardly original back in 1998 a movie starring talia shire called the landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger characters br br the story is amanda lear has had a bad life abusive father horny doctor mental homes etc she s finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor who she anally abuses and kills the poor guy the doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard after moving in she falls in love with a stud named richard who just happens to be married to a blues singer if you ve seen the landlady you know the rest she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and richard br br much of the idea s came from the previous movie same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn same flying a bodypress it did have some original material the beer bottle thing was brutal the highlight of the movie was amanda s beautiful breasts in the hot top scene somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of time br br 4 out of 10
this had to be one of the worst films ever when kate shows up and jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping so hollywood another bad scene was when kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement andie s acting is so bad in this film i could not connect with them or feel there love for each other the other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed andie anyway this was such a campy movie i usually like these type of films but i just couldn t get into this film too many unlikely situations and again andie s acting didn t help the film also she is all gums lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals 
about 15 minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack thereof they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should ve been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could when this would let up we d sit back and watch and wait for the next gross out or offensive remark after about 35 minutes we both got up and left everything we d read said how great this was the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasn t a crude sex comedy did he go to the right movie along with be cool it s the only other movie i ve ever walked out on and i have no regrets i m sick of trying to go see comedies in america 
today i found they all laughed on vhs on sale in a rental it was a really old and very used vhs i had no information about this movie but i liked the references listed on its cover the names of peter bogdanovich audrey hepburn john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it i searched imdb and the user rating of 6 0 was an excellent reference i looked in mick martin marsha porter video dvd guide 2003 and wow four stars so i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it indeed i have just finished watching they all laughed and i found it a very boring overrated movie the characters are badly developed and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story the plot is supposed to be funny but i have not laughed along the whole story the coincidences in a huge city like new york are ridiculous ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt antonio banderas or george clooney is quite ridiculous in the end the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in star 80 and death of a centerfold the dorothy stratten story the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen the future mrs keith richards the always wonderful even being fifty two years old audrey hepburn and the song amigo from roberto carlos although i do not like him roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60 s and is called by his fans as the king i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions my vote is four br br title muito riso e muita alegria 
when i saw the preview i thought this is going to be a great movie and indeed it could have been the actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of the filming is undeniable however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610 and it took away most of the magic of the film however i must congratulate the translator because the english sub titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd 
i saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that my girl friend turned to me and said we have to go see this movie enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and i tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren t even any of those it has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall i would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music there was absolutely no character development br br the plot is just well there was no plot it was basically i know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer that s brilliant hmmm the acting was what you expect in a australian soap opera hopeless that main character the blondie god dam she annoyed me her longest line must have been half a sentence and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression br br please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don t go see this and if your like me and don t have a choice well then i wish you good luck maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine can t believe this film got made 
i basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn t make sense the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see chace crawford he is so hot but in this movie his hair was kind of weird but still hot br br however despite how hot chace is it really did not make up for the film i guess the plot isn t that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every time the cussing was annoying and the whole flashy camera shaking thing gave me a headache br br all in all although the plot was ok i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic that s why i only cut to scenes with chace in it lol anyways not worth renting unless your a die hard fan of a specific cast member like i was oh yeah the cast was hot the girls were hot but chace is the best 
closer to reality and containing more depth than breakdance stan lathan s beat street is still a pretty dull show again this pic is really only cashing in on the breakin craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother all growing up in queens new york each has their own unique talent one is a hustler one a d j another an artist who creates burners while little bro lee is a hot hip hop dancer br br lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the fresh dancing to save the day br br choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes but this alone is not enough to lift beat street to greater heights unfortunately the film really falls flat late on after showing a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting br br sunday august 25 1996 video
despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals this movie is not for everyone br br the story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family she does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and wins br br in girlfight it s boxing in bend it like beckham it s soccer and now it s kung fu br br but fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it semra turan the actress that playing the role of a teenage girl maybe can do a lot of things but one thing she can t do is to act her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy the dramatic situations in which she tries to show some emotions are dreadful her body and facial language are of amateur actress badly instructed by the director the rest of the cast is a little better but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer br br even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this it s just so boring the slow motion was really unnecessary the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions not actually fighting not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys and knocks them off their feet br br the only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it s european it s very easy to publicize this movie a first martial arts film from denmark but don t be fooled it s not it s just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems which are by the way not really convincing br br bad movie with embarrassing lines acting and story 
the main reason people still care about carlton browne of the f o is that it features peter sellers in a second billed role but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistake br br sellers plays amphibulos a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt poor island nation of gaillardia formerly a british colony now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war amphibulos wants to play both u k and soviet interests against each other for easy profit everything very friendly and all our cards under the table terry thomas is the title character a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain hasn t forgotten them all appearances to the contrary br br a positive review here says the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated i would argue that the reason carlton browne is considered below average is because the comedy is non existent br br after a decent opening that establishes the film s only two strengths a sympathetically doltish terry thomas and john addison s full on larky score things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes the low opinion of carlton browne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia is milked to death by the time we actually reach the island expectations are quite low br br they re still too high though the island itself which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade the army is apparently still horse drawn allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick accented announcer in war the army uses many horse br br sellers never quite takes center stage even when we re on his character s island the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his father s assassination bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written normally this would make him the likely target for scene stealing by sellers but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year the mouse that roared and i m all right jack br br strange that this film like jack was a boulting brothers production with roy boulting here serving as co director alongside jeffrey dell usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything goes comedy but here there are only fey jabs in either direction amphibulos works his mangled english vibe for all its worth while carlton browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve br br the weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loris s romance with ilyena score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed br br the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one and a final bit of action by carlton browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally apparently he lives to see another day but the film of the same name is strictly doa 
there really wasn t much of a story in this film it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness but there isn t much more than that br br it mixes some scenes from the original then it ab libs about how this movie changed them a little bit but still is that it i was hoping for something a little more instead all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation br br i guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe then this is it but other than that it does little justice for the animators disney really should stop these direct to video productions it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham d 
this has got to be the most stupid film i have ever seen first of all the plot is stupid the little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it we find that the kid has a gift the shining this gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy he goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because well he feels like it why else would he do it all of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub the man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse which is utterly disgusting somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe then the kid and the woman take the black man s vehicle and leave the father who dies within minutes of hypothermia most movies aren t a complete waste of time but this falls right into that category the music is trashy the characters are corny the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit the ending is very predictable the storyline is slow tedious and boring this movie is extremely overrated avoid this movie at all costs i m surprised it s gotten such a high rating on imdb 
whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes this episode deviates in the extreme and the result is a major flop br br would you believe columbo never faces the villain till the very end br br frankly i was tempted to turn it off about two thirds through br br oh the sacrifices we self appointed reviewers make 
the invisible man is a fantastic movie from 1933 a cutting edge film for it s time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible go ahead take a look at the film you will be shocked that it was made in 1933 it was the first true special effects movie come 2000 computer aided special effects seem like child s play audiences are not blown away by special effects instead they are disappointed if they are not done right the special effects in hollow man the update of the hg wells story are ok but not the biggest problem with this film directed by paul verhoeven who you might remember from showgirls and total recall kevin bacon plays sebastian caine a scientist dabbling in the world of bio invisibilation but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team s funding so as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation process the process has dire consequences no caine does not die but instead becomes a horny violent creature aka a guy now that he s invisible caine stalks a sexy neighbor a co worker former girlfriend linda and the man who took away his funding then a funny thing happens caine becomes a new supernatural being the thing that won t die laughing in the face of all things natural caine faces down death and spits in it s face as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die dragging the ending of the movie out the movie is silly stupid and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used sometimes not there are neat possibilities in hollow man but of course not one of them is explored for a more interesting look at an invisible being get ready for some good old fashioned black and white cinema and check out the 1933 invisible man kevin bacon will still be invisible when you come back probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano 
i m not particularly fond of remakes or to steal the modern jargon retellings but this film truly peeved me off the original prom night while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece still realized what it was horror there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience sorry folks but a white knuckle film this was not the scares were cheap and foreshadowed terribly this film couldn t successfully pull that off so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film there needs to be a likable hero or heroine this film doesn t have one the person i most identified with was the head detective his calm demeanor but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have common sense approach to events that occur if you friend disappears you don t go looking for them alone and if you suspect foul play you tell someone not investigate yourself these clichés are tired and well overplayed in the horror genre in general and in this film in particular 
first of all if you r a fan of the comic well you ll be very disappointed i m sure low budget movie  largo is supposed to be serbian in the comic now suddenly he becomes croatian pfff chicken producers it gave some spice and guts to the comic the striking n y winch building becomes a common average small yacht in h k the good looking largo becomes some unshaved tzigan turkish looking guy freddy the cool scarface pilot becomes some fat out of shape sad average guy simon largo s good buddy does not exist at all he gave some pepper largo doesn t throw knifes at all but just some snake stares the whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious tv film french directors and producers if you don t have the money the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic please stick to some romance shooted in paris very very bad film good thing i just rented it don t count on me to watch the sequel 
its plain to see why the makers of scary movie found it so easy to spoof these teen slasher movies they are so unbelievably formulaic and if valentine had been released a year or so earlier i m sure they would have been spoofing this film too that s if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the screams i know what you did last summers and urban legends br br valentine offers nothing new to this genre except a better than usual ending which of course leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel as always a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women killing the main character s friends one by one in typically over the top style lots of t a on display no character development bad acting and overly elaborate bloodshed br br the thing i can t stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as who done its the thing is that they aren t because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked and tells the main character who s friends have now all been murdered usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway everybody still left alive throughout the film is a suspect but they are more red herrings than suspects as we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed br br valentine followed this formula almost to the letter    spoiler     in valentine the motive was not revealed but more left for you to think about given that the film didn t quite conclude in the typical teen slash way the issue is only part resolved and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody will the killer want more or were the demons truly vanquished br br this still didn t make valentine a good film instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual which still doesn t count for much to anybody thinking of making another film along these lines please don t originality is so important and its hard to see any originality coming out of this genre 
i don t quite get the rating for the amati girls and i think i was really kind giving it a 4 out of 10 what could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes there are so many clichés in that flick the women s hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake there s no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over acting over any limits that it hurts it s not funny enough to be a comedy it s too fake sad to really touch so in my eyes it s just not good watching it i couldn t believe how something like that made it to my tv set in my living room in switzerland but maybe it still was ok and it just got lost in translation who knows definitely one of the oddest movies i ve ever seen and this certainly not in a good way sorry 
why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain they ruin all the good work by making a bad movie burt reynolds peaked then started making dreadful hal needham car chase flicks arnold schwarzenegger became the hottest property in hollywood only to invite derision upon himself with the appalling last action hero and here loquacious eddie murphy erases memories of trading places and 48 hours with this family adventure flick which is an unbelievably tedious childish and generally plain awful misfire in which the chance to see charlotte lewis s great big breasts in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the entire film br br the story is pure humdrum it concerns social worker murphy contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one chosen for what i hear you ask his job is to rescue a tibetan boy with mystical powers from a race of demons who want to rule the world as the main demon classy actor charles dance looks terribly embarrassed to be in the film but hey i m sure he was well paid for sacrificing his talents of all murphy s films this is easily the worst i ve read some reviews which suggest that it is nice to see murphy in an atypical role in a non formulaic kind of film and while both points are loosely true there s no forgiving the fact that the film however atypical and non formulaic it might be is an absolute load of garbage br br 
film version of sandra bernhard s one woman off broadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say she s scathingly honest and that may be true but she s also shrill with an unapologetic in your face bravado that isn t well suited to a film in this genre she doesn t want to make nice and she s certainly not out to make friends and that s always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard co wrote the show with director john boskovich their oddest touch was in having all of sandra s in house audiences looking completely bored a feeling many real viewers will most likely share 1 2 from  
the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff i ve only seen perhaps eight of them but comet over broadway is the worst so far the very best thing about it is that it s short oh and the orry kelly gowns are fine james wong howe s cinematography is not kay francis throughout looks fat faced and far less attractive than she normally does minna gombell whom i don t know otherwise is good as a semi tough burlesque dancer the closing shot kay francis and her child walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous the whole film is so cheap so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it warner bros tossing garbage to dolts who don t know in warner bros cynical estimation of them that what they re getting is garbage 
chilly alienating adaptation of rebecca west s book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks this extremely well cast soaper brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co stars jackson christie ann margret and ian holm but the burners are all on low there are a handful of good scenes but bridges pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film s dulled out color is enervating long on the shelf this soldier is best left forgotten 1 2 from  
long boring blasphemous never have i been so glad to see ending credits roll 
just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival just before going i came here to see how it was rated and at that time it was 7 4 a pretty nice rate br br after 15 minutes i was dying to get out but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening br br i did not like at all the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere the characters are shallower than the dialogs nothing lead anywhere and the worst and worst plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile popping up all the time on her lap top or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen all of this would be bearable if the plot characters romances anything was good but was bad really bad a don t know how to do sex in the city br br don t waste your time or money 
a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful here we get the usual group of people stranded on an island the characters are pretty much stereotypes middle aged but dashing hero demure heroine sluttish companion a meek but devoted stage manager a couple of lesbians a mysterious gardener an envious housekeeper a religious fanatic of a butler an impressionable chambermaid etc while the film is not by any means unwatchable the atrocious dubbing snail s pace shoddy production and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half hour do not help matters besides marcello giombini s score though pleasant in itself comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances that said the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one 
i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen br br boy was i disappointed this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable george c scott is an excellent actor but in this it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20 of the time the rest of the time he was quite flat br br i realize that this was made in 84 pre cg effects for the most part but it looked to be very b movie quality especially the encounter with jacob marley br br the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime br br i will admit that mr scott did a good job with the reformed scrooge at the end that was a refreshing portrayal br br i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down trodden and tiny tim oh don t even get me started on bad child actors 
if i had not read pat barker s union street before seeing this film i would have liked it unfortuntately this is not the case it is actually my kind of film it is well made and in no way do i want to say otherwise but as an adaptation it fails from every angle br br the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished i was put through tears repulsion shock anger sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street excellent a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of but i novel i simply couldn t put down depressing yes but utterly gripping br br the film oh dear hollywood took barker s truth and reality and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it a beautiful film an inspiring soundtrack excellent performances a tale of hope and romance yes an adaptation of union street no br br the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fonda s character their stories are touched on but many are discarded i accept that some of barker s tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn t practical but the content is not my main issue the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost darkness and rain broken windows covered with cardboard and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine pretty houses and a twinkling william s score br br if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of reality i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like schindler s list but without the happy ending 
one star that s all this documentary deserves i haven t felt this disappointed in watching a movie let alone a documentary in quite some time br br i m a big fan of the walking with  series including it s nigel marvin spin offs for all their gleeful fun yet informative information and although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures the subject is still interesting and unique to explore having seen all the other docs from the series i figured i need to see this one as well especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places br br well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc what were you thinking lol br br though the information that they were able to get through was interesting the presentation failed in every other way possible it had a terrible flow was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say horrible effects and overused mtv style camera effects br br speaking of the makeup effects one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man in suit horror movie well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous none of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions br br the worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks remotely real it doesn t even look like it was taken seriously it also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had remember the episode in walking with dinosaurs of the fate of the ornithochirus that episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time i watch it it s this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all when you are more engaged in the subject and it s own personal story even one that is just speculation you care more about the facts surrounding it br br the only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration and the music otherwise do not bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh this does not belong on the shelf with the other walking with  docs br br and does it make sense to learn that this doc was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series hmmm 
outside of the fact that george lopez is a pretentious jerk his show is terrible br br nothing about lopez has ever been funny i have watched his stand up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh br br his stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body br br i have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them br br this guy has a grudge that won t end br br i feel bad for hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves br br the shows plots are always cookie cutter with an hispanic accent br br canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes br br might be why this show is always on at 2am in replay 
as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1 2 hour however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she s in connery is fine as is fishbourne but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality and the ending is simply bizarre the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration to the point where it becomes laughable if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it 
i rarely make these comments but i felt compelled to spare others the pain i endured in watching this movie it s so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can t suspend disbelief the problem starts early when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle overlooking the capitol building in washington d c that kind of life on a government salary hah it only gets worse toward the end when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die in order to cleanse the gene pool the special effects are pretty good any producer s money can buy that and the lead actors have been great in other films but the screenplay and direction here are moronic many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind paul verhoeven s previous facially stupid movies but this movie should stop the wondering he s just plain bad 
this was awful andie macdowell is a terrible actress so wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job but then remember that turn in four weddings equally as excruciating another film that portrays england as full of chocolate box cottages and village greens i mean that school how many schools apart from maybe hogwarts look like that the twee police station looked like the set from heartbeat this film just couldn t make its mind up what it wanted to be a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women s friendships if it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked but those scenes just didn t work with the tragedy in the second half i also find it implausible that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour a final note what is a decent actress like staunton doing in this pile of poo not to mention anna chancellor macdowell should stick to advertising wrinkle cream 
must every good story be improved with added corny broadway music apparently those who can t come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering i confess that oliver twist and similar stories are not my favorites as it is certainly true that dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out and this was a great example of just that so of course take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it s uplifting argh fetch me a basin br br the four stars in my rating come from casting which i could liken to that of my fair lady each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of but then they must go and have them sing unlike my fair lady those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of oliver reed br br my biggest complaint i ve stated why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story seldom has this been done to good effect generally it ruins the story it did with this one jury s still out on whether this story is worth saving but with all that gadding about it s impossible to tell

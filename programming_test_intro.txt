a lisp is a speech impediment historically also known as sigmatism stereotypically people with a lisp are unable to pronounce sibilants and replace them with interdentals though there are actually several kinds of lisps the result is that the speech is unclear 
in computer software an application binary interface describes the low level interface between an application program and the operating system or another application 
in computer science a is a best first graph search algorithm that finds the least cost path from a given initial node to one goal node it uses a distance plus cost heuristic function to determine the order in which the search visits nodes in the tree the distance plus cost heuristic is a sum of two functions the path cost function which may or may not be a heuristic and an admissible heuristic estimate of the distance to the goal the path cost function g is the cost from the starting node to the current node since the h part of the f function must be an admissible heuristic it must not overestimate the distance to the goal thus for an application like routing h might represent the straight line distance to the goal since that is physically the smallest possible distance between any two points the algorithm was first described in 1968 by peter hart nils nilsson and bertram raphael in their paper it was called algorithm a since using this algorithm yields optimal behavior for a given heuristic it has been called a this algorithm has been generalized into a bidirectional heuristic search algorithm see bidirectional search 
a user agent is the client application used with a particular network protocol the phrase is most commonly used in reference to those which access the world wide web other systems such as session initiation protocol use the term user agent to refer to both end points of a phone call server and client web user agents range from web browsers and e mail clients to search engine crawlers as well as mobile phones screen readers and braille browsers used by people with disabilities when internet users visit a web site a text string is generally sent to identify the user agent to the server this forms part of the http request prefixed with user agent and typically includes information such as the application name version host operating system and language bots such as web crawlers often also include a url and or e mail address so that the webmaster can contact the operator of the bot the user agent string is one of the criteria by which web crawlers can be excluded from certain pages or parts of a website using the robots exclusion standard this allows webmasters who feel that certain parts of their website should not be included in the data gathered by a particular crawler or that a particular crawler is using up too much bandwidth to request that crawler not to visit those pages 
ws security is a communications protocol providing a means for applying security to web services on april 19 2004 the ws security 1 0 standard was released by oasis open on february 17 2006 they released version 1 1 originally developed by ibm microsoft and verisign the protocol is now officially called wss and developed via committee in oasis open the protocol contains specifications on how integrity and confidentiality can be enforced on web services messaging the wss protocol includes details on the use of saml and kerberos and certificate formats such as x 509 ws security describes how to attach signatures and encryption headers to soap messages in addition it describes how to attach security tokens including binary security tokens such as x 509 certificates and kerberos tickets to messages ws security incorporates security features in the header of a soap message working in the application layer thus it ensures end to end security 
the java remote method invocation api or java rmi a java application programming interface performs the object oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls two common implementations of the api exist usage of the term rmi may denote solely the programming interface or may signify both the api and jrmp whereas the term rmi iiop denotes the rmi interface delegating most of the functionality to the supporting corba implementation the programmers of the original rmi api generalized the code somewhat to support different implementations such as an http transport additionally work was done to corba adding a pass by value capability to support the rmi interface still the rmi iiop and jrmp implementations do not have fully identical interfaces rmi functionality comes in the package java rmi while most of sun s implementation is located in the sun rmi package note that with java versions before java 5 0 developers had to compile rmi stubs in a separate compilation step using rmic version 5 0 of java and beyond no longer require this step jini offers a more advanced version of rmi in java it functions similarly but provides more advanced searching capabilities and mechanisms for distributed object applications 
java business integration is a specification developed under the java community process for an approach to implementing a service oriented architecture the jcp reference is jsr 208 for jbi 1 0 and jsr 312 for jbi 2 0 jbi is built on a web services model and provides a pluggable architecture for a container that hosts service producer and consumer components services connect to the container via binding components or can be hosted inside the container as part of a service engine the services model used is web services description language 2 0 the central message delivery mechanism the normalized message router delivers normalized messages via one of four message exchange patterns taken from wsdl 2 0 to handle functionality that deals with installation deployment monitoring and lifecycle concerns amongst bcs and ses java management extensions is used jbi defines standardized packaging for bcs and ses allowing components to be portable to any jbi implementation without modification jbi defines standard packaging for composite applications applications that are composed of service consumers and providers individual service units are deployable to components groups of service units are gathered together into a service assembly the service assembly includes metadata for wiring the service units together as well as wiring service units to external services this provides a simple mechanism for performing composite application assembly using services 
in computing virtualization is a broad term that refers to the abstraction of computer resources virtualization can also refer to physicalization is the converse approach to virtualized data centers where instead of allocating workloads across subdivided single machine virtualized resources the hardware is organized as replicated sets of simple atomic compute resources that are not virtualized external control software dispatches workloads to these individual atomic compute nodes in much the same way as a vmm manages workload placement in a virtualized system 
the bresenham line algorithm is an algorithm which determines which points in an n dimensional raster should be plotted in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two given points it is commonly used to draw lines on a computer screen as it uses only integer addition subtraction and bit shifting all of which are very cheap operations in standard computer architectures it is one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics through a minor expansion the original algorithm for lines can also be used to draw circles also this can be done with simple arithmetic operations quadratic or trigonometric expressions can be avoided or recursively dissolved into simpler steps the mentioned properties make it still an important algorithm and it is used among others in plotters in graphics chips of modern graphics cards and in many graphics libraries because the algorithm is very simple it is often implemented in both the firmware and the hardware of graphics cards the label bresenham is today often used for a whole family of algorithms which have been developed by others later yet in succession of bresenham and with a similar basic approach see deeper references below 
password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system a common approach is to repeatedly try guesses for the password the purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password to gain unauthorized access to a system or as a preventive measure by system administrators to check for easily crackable passwords on a file by file basis password cracking is utilized to gain access to digital evidence for which a judge has allowed access but the particular file s access is restricted 
in computer science computability theory is the branch of the theory of computation that studies which problems are computationally solvable using different models of computation computability theory differs from the related discipline of computational complexity theory which deals with the question of how efficiently a problem can be solved rather than whether it is solvable at all 
algol known colloquially as the demon star is a bright star in the constellation perseus it is one of the best known eclipsing binaries the first such star to be discovered and also one of the first variable stars to be discovered algol is actually a three star system in which the large and bright primary beta persei a is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer beta persei b thus algol s magnitude is usually near constant at 2 1 but regularly dips to 3 4 every 2 days 20 hours and 49 minutes during the roughly 10 hour long partial eclipses there is also a secondary eclipse when the brighter star occults the fainter secondary this secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically

auto_ptr is a class template available in the c standard library that provides some basic raii features for c raw pointers the auto_ptr template class describes an object that stores a pointer to an allocated object of type type that ensures that the object to which it points gets destroyed automatically when control leaves a scope the shared_ptr template class proposed in technical report 1 and available in the boost library can be used as an alternative to auto_ptr for collections with ownership semantics 
in computing regular expressions provide a concise and flexible means for identifying strings of text of interest such as particular characters words or patterns of characters regular expressions are written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor a program that either serves as a parser generator or examines text and identifies parts that match the provided specification the following examples illustrate a few specifications that could be expressed in a regular expression regular expressions can be much more complex than these examples regular expressions are used by many text editors utilities and programming languages to search and manipulate text based on patterns for example perl ruby and tcl have a powerful regular expression engine built directly into their syntax several utilities provided by unix distributions including the editor ed and the filter grep were the first to popularize the concept of regular expressions as an example of the syntax the regular expression bex can be used to search for all instances of the string ex that occur after word boundaries thus in the string texts for experts bex matches the ex in experts but not in texts many modern computing systems provide wildcard characters in matching filenames from a file system this is a core capability of many command line shells and is also known as globbing wildcards differ from regular expressions in that they generally only express very limited forms of alternatives

delta encoding is a way of storing or transmitting data in the form of differences between sequential data rather than complete files delta encoding is sometimes called delta compression particularly where archival histories of changes are required the differences are recorded in discrete files called deltas or diffs after the unix file comparison utility diff because changes are often small delta encoding greatly reduces data redundancy collections of unique deltas are substantially more space efficient than their non encoded equivalents from a logical point of view the difference between two data values is the information required to obtain one value from the other the difference between identical values is often called 0 or the neutral element a good delta should be minimal or ambiguous unless one element of a pair is present perhaps the simplest example is storing values of bytes as differences between sequential values rather than the values themselves so instead of 2 4 6 9 7 we would store 2 2 2 3 2 this is not very useful when used alone but it can help further compression of data in which sequential values occur often iff 8svx sound format applies this encoding to raw sound data before applying compression to it unfortunately not even all 8 bit sound samples compress better when delta encoded and the usability of delta encoding is even smaller for 16 bit and better samples therefore compression algorithms often choose to delta encode only when the compression is better than without however in video compression delta frames can considerably reduce frame size and are used in virtually every video compression codec a delta can be defined in 2 ways symmetric delta and directed delta a symmetric delta can be expressed as where v1 and v2 represent two successive versions a directed delta also called a change is a sequence of change operations which when applied to one version v1 yields another version v2 a variation of delta encoding which encodes differences between the prefixes or suffixes of strings is called incremental encoding it is particularly effective for sorted lists with small differences between strings such as a list of words from a dictionary in delta encoded transmission over a network where only a single copy of the file is available at each end of the communication channel special error control codes are used to detect which parts of the file has changed since its previous version the nature of the data to be encoded influences the effectiveness of a particular compression algorithm delta encoding performs best when data has small or constant variation for an unsorted data set there may be little to no compression possible with this method the following c code performs a simple form of delta encoding and decoding another instance of use of delta encoding is rfc 3229 delta encoding in http which proposes that http servers should be able to send updated web pages in the form of differences between versions which should decrease internet traffic as most pages change slowly over time rather than being completely rewritten repeatedly this document describes how delta encoding can be supported as a compatible extension to http 1 1 many http requests cause the retrieval of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache entry research has shown that such modifying updates are frequent and that the modifications are typically much smaller than the actual entity in such cases http would make more efficient use of network bandwidth if it could transfer a minimal description of the changes rather than the entire new instance of the resource

ski combinator calculus is a computational system that is a reduced untyped version of lambda calculus all operations in lambda calculus are expressed in ski as binary trees whose leaves are one of the three symbols s k and i in fact the symbol i is added only for convenience and just the other two suffice for all of the purposes of the ski system although the most formal representation of the objects in this system requires binary trees they are usually represented for typesettability as parenthesized expressions either with all the subtrees parenthesized or only the right side children subtrees parenthesized so the tree whose left subtree is the tree ks and whose right subtree is the tree sk is usually typed as or more simply as ks instead of being fully drawn as a tree 
ole for process control which stands for object linking and embedding for process control is the original name for a standards specification developed in 1996 by an industrial automation industry task force the standard specifies the communication of real time plant data between control devices from different manufacturers after the initial release the opc foundation was created to maintain the standard since then standards have been added and names have been changed as of june 2006 opc is a series of standards specifications  the first standard is now called the data access specification or opc data access or opc data access specification while opc originally stood for ole for process control the official stance of the opc foundation is that opc is no longer an acronym and the technology is simply known as opc one of the reasons behind this is while opc is heavily used within the process industries it can be and is widely used in discrete manufacturing as well hence opc is known for more than just its applications within process control

representational state transfer is a style of software architecture for distributed hypermedia systems such as the world wide web as such it is not strictly a method for building web services the terms representational state transfer and rest were introduced in 2000 in the doctoral dissertation of roy fielding one of the principal authors of the hypertext transfer protocol specification rest refers in the strictest sense to a collection of network architecture principles which outline how resources are defined and addressed the term is often used more loosely to describe any simple interface which transmits domain specific data over http without an additional messaging layer such as soap or session tracking via http cookies these two meanings can conflict as well as overlap it is possible to design a software system in accordance with fielding s rest architectural style without using http and without interacting with the world wide web it is also possible to design simple xml http interfaces which do not conform to rest principles and instead follow a model of remote procedure call the difference between the uses of the term rest therefore causes some confusion in technical discussions systems which follow fielding s rest principles are often referred to as restful 
the jacquard loom is a mechanical loom invented by joseph marie jacquard in 1801 that simplifies the process of manufacturing textiles with complex patterns such as brocade damask and matelasse the loom is controlled by punchcards with punched holes each row of which corresponds to one row of the design multiple rows of holes are punched on each card and the many cards that compose the design of the textile are strung together in order it is based on earlier inventions by the frenchmen basile bouchon jean falcon and jacques vaucanson 
bytecode is a term which has been used to denote various forms of instruction sets designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter as well as being suitable for further compilation into machine code since instructions are processed by software they may be arbitrarily complex but are nonetheless often akin to traditional hardware instructions stack machines are common for instance different parts may often be stored in separate files similar to object modules but dynamically loaded during execution the name bytecode stems from instruction sets which have one byte opcodes followed by optional parameters intermediate representations such as bytecode may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run on different platforms bytecode may often be either directly executed on a virtual machine or it may be further compiled into machine code for better performance unlike human readable source code bytecodes are compact numeric codes constants and references which encode the result of parsing and semantic analysis of things like type scope and nesting depths of program objects they therefore allow much better performance than direct interpretation of source code

gregory john chaitin is an argentine american mathematician and computer scientist beginning in the late 1960s chaitin made contributions to algorithmic information theory and metamathematics in particular a new incompleteness theorem in reaction to gödel s incompleteness theorem he attended the bronx high school of science and city college of new york where he developed the theories that led to his independent discovery of kolmogorov complexity chaitin has defined chaitin s constant ω a real number whose digits are equidistributed and which is sometimes informally described as an expression of the probability that a random program will halt ω has the mathematical property that it is definable but not computable chaitin s early work on algorithmic information theory paralleled the earlier work of kolmogorov chaitin also writes about philosophy especially metaphysics and philosophy of mathematics in metaphysics chaitin claims that algorithmic information theory is the key to solving problems in the field of biology and neuroscience indeed in recent writings he defends a position known as digital philosophy in the epistemology of mathematics he claims that his findings in mathematical logic and algorithmic information theory show there are mathematical facts that are true for no reason they re true by accident they are random mathematical facts chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a quasi empirical methodology chaitin is also the originator of using graph coloring to do register allocation in compiling a process known as chaitin s algorithm in 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science honoris causa by the university of maine in 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the university of buenos aires in argentina where his parents were born and where chaitin spent part of his youth he is a research staff member at ibm s thomas j watson research center and also a visiting professor at the computer science department of the university of auckland and on the international committee of the valparaíso complex systems institute 
streaming api for xml is an application programming interface to read and write xml documents in the java programming language traditionally xml apis are either both have advantages the former allows for random access to the document the latter requires a small memory footprint and is typically much faster these two access metaphors can be thought of as polar opposites a tree based api allows unlimited random access and manipulation while an event based api is a one shot pass through the source document stax was designed as a median between these two opposites in the stax metaphor the programmatic entry point is a cursor that represents a point within the document the application moves the cursor forward pulling the information from the parser as it needs this is different from an event based api such as sax which pushes data to the application requiring the application to maintain state between events as necessary to keep track of location within the document 
in computer networking a port is an application specific or process specific software construct serving as a communications endpoint used by transport layer protocols of the internet protocol suite such as transmission control protocol and user datagram protocol a specific port is identified by its number commonly known as the port number the ip address it is associated with and the protocol used for communication 
progressive disclosure is an interaction design technique often used in human computer interaction to help maintain the focus of a user s attention by reducing clutter confusion and cognitive workload this improves usability by presenting only the minimum data required for the task at hand the principle is used in journalism s inverted pyramid style learning s spiral approach and the game twenty questions 
remote procedure call is an inter process communication technology that allows a computer program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute in another address space without the programmer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction that is the programmer would write essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program or remote when the software in question is written using object oriented principles rpc may be referred to as remote invocation or remote method invocation note that there are many different technologies commonly used to accomplish this which are often incompatible 
the buddy memory allocation technique is a memory allocation technique that divides memory into partitions to try to satisfy a memory request as suitably as possible this system makes use of splitting memory into halves to try to give a best fit according to donald knuth the buddy system was invented in 1963 by harry markowitz who won the 1990 nobel memorial prize in economics and was independently developed by knowlton

in computer science a library is a collection of subroutines or classes used to develop software libraries contain code and data that provide services to independent programs this allows code and data to be shared and changed in a modular fashion some executables are both standalone programs and libraries but most libraries are not executables executables and libraries make references known as links to each other through the process known as linking which is typically done by a linker most modern operating systems provide libraries that implement the majority of system services such libraries have commoditized the services a modern application expects an os to provide as such most code used by modern applications is provided in these libraries 
in mathematics the mandelbrot set named after benoît mandelbrot is a set of points in the complex plane the boundary of which forms a fractal mathematically the mandelbrot set can be defined as the set of complex values of c for which the orbit of 0 under iteration of the complex quadratic polynomial zn 1 zn2 c remains bounded that is a complex number c is in the mandelbrot set if when starting with z0 0 and applying the iteration repeatedly the absolute value of zn never exceeds a certain number however large n gets for example letting c 1 gives the sequence 0 1 2 5 26 which tends to infinity as this sequence is unbounded 1 is not an element of the mandelbrot set on the other hand c i gives the sequence 0 i  i  i which is bounded and so i belongs to the mandelbrot set when computed and graphed on the complex plane the mandelbrot set is seen to have an elaborate boundary which does not simplify at any given magnification this qualifies the boundary as a fractal the mandelbrot set has become popular outside mathematics both for its aesthetic appeal and for being a complicated structure arising from a simple definition benoît mandelbrot and others worked hard to communicate this area of mathematics to the public 
in the field of logic in computer science model checking refers to the following problem given a simplified model of a system test automatically whether this model meets a given specification typically the systems one has in mind are hardware or software systems and the specification contains safety requirements such as the absence of deadlocks and similar critical states that can cause the system to crash in order to solve such a problem algorithmically both the model of the system and the specification are formulated in some precise mathematical language to this end it is formulated as a task in logic namely to check whether a given structure satisfies a given logical formula the concept is general and applies to all kinds of logics and suitable structures a simple model checking problem is verifying whether a given formula in the propositional logic is satisfied by a given structure 
in computing protected mode also called protected virtual address mode is an operational mode of x86 compatible central processing units it was first added to the x86 architecture in 1982 with the release of intel s 80286 processor and later extended with the release of the 80386 in 1985 protected mode allows system software to utilize features such as virtual memory paging safe multi tasking and other features designed to increase an operating system s control over application software when a processor that supports x86 protected mode is powered on it begins executing instructions in real mode in order to maintain backwards compatibility with earlier x86 processors protected mode may only be entered after the system software sets up several descriptor tables and enables the protection enable bit in the control register 0 due to the enhancements added by protected mode it has become widely adopted and has become the foundation for all subsequent enhancements to the x86 architecture 
the mozilla application framework is a collection of cross platform software components that make up the mozilla applications it was originally known as xpfe an abbreviation of cross platform front end it was also known as xptoolkit to avoid confusion it is now best referred to as the mozilla application framework while similar to generic cross platform application frameworks like gtk qt and wxwidgets the intent is to provide a subset of cross platform functionality suitable for building network applications like web browsers leveraging the cross platform functionality already built into the gecko layout engine the following are the various components of the framework

studiesneuro linguistic programming is defined in the oxford english dictionary as a model of interpersonal communication chiefly concerned with the relationship between successful patterns of behaviour and the subjective experiences underlying them and a system of alternative therapy based on this which seeks to educate people in self awareness and effective communication and to change their patterns of mental and emotional behaviour the co founders richard bandler and linguist john grinder claimed it would be instrumental in finding ways to help people have better fuller and richer lives they coined the title to denote a supposed theoretical connection between neurological processes language and behavioral patterns that have been learned through experience and that can be organised to achieve specific goals in life nlp was originally promoted by its founders bandler and grinder in the 1970s as an extraordinarily effective and rapid form of psychological therapy capable of addressing the full range of problems which psychologists are likely to encounter such as phobias depression habit disorder psychosomatic illnesses learning disorders it also espoused the potential for self determination through overcoming learned limitations and emphasized well being and healthy functioning later it was promoted as a science of excellence derived from the study or modeling of how successful or outstanding people in different fields obtain their results it was claimed that these skills can be learned by anyone to improve their effectiveness both personally and professionallybecause of the absence of any firm empirical evidence supporting its sometimes extravagant claims nlp has enjoyed little or no support from the scientific community it continues to make no impact on mainstream academic psychology and only limited impact on mainstream psychotherapy and counselling however it has some influence among private psychotherapists including hypnotherapists to the extent that they claim to be trained in nlp and use nlp in their work it has also had an enormous influence in management training life coaching and the self help industry 
general purpose computing on graphics processing units is the technique of using a gpu which typically handles computation only for computer graphics to perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the cpu it is made possible by the addition of programmable stages and higher precision arithmetic to the rendering pipelines which allows software developers to use stream processing on non graphics data

a sequence point in imperative programming defines any point in a computer program s execution at which it is guaranteed that all side effects of previous evaluations will have been performed and no side effects from subsequent evaluations have yet been performed they are often mentioned in reference to c and c because the result of some expressions can depend on the order of evaluation of their subexpressions adding one or more sequence points is one method of ensuring a consistent result because this restricts the possible orders of evaluation 
in mathematics and computer science graph theory is the study of graphs mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects from a certain collection a graph in this context refers to a collection of vertices or nodes and a collection of edges that connect pairs of vertices a graph may be undirected meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge or its edges may be directed from one vertex to another see graph for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graphs that are commonly considered the graphs studied in graph theory should not be confused with graphs of functions and other kinds of graphs please refer to glossary of graph theory for some basic definitions in graph theory 
clips is a public domain software tool for building expert systems the name is an acronym for c language integrated production system the syntax and name was inspired by charles forgy s ops the first versions of clips were developed starting in 1985 at nasa johnson space center until the mid 1990s when the development group s responsibilities ceased to focus on expert system technology the original name of the project was nasa s ai language clips is probably the most widely used expert system tool because it is fast efficient and free although it is now in the public domain it is still updated and supported by the original author gary riley clips incorporates a complete object oriented language cool for writing expert systems though it is written in c its interface more closely resembles that of the programming language lisp extensions can be written in c and clips can be called from c 
in software engineering a directory is similar to a dictionary it enables the look up of a name and information associated with that name as a word in a dictionary may have multiple definitions in a directory a name may be associated with multiple different pieces of information likewise as a word may have different parts of speech and different definitions a name in a directory may have many different types of data based on this rudimentary explanation of a directory a directory service is simply the software system that stores organizes and provides access to information in a directory directories may be very narrow in scope supporting only a small set of node types and data types or they may be very broad supporting an arbitrary or extensible set of types in a telephone directory the nodes are names and the data items are telephone numbers in the dns the nodes are domain names and the data items are ip addresses in a directory used by a network operating system the nodes represent resources that are managed by the os including users computers printers and other shared resources many different directory services have been used since the advent of the internet but this article focuses mainly on those that have descended from the x 500 directory service

reversi is a board game involving abstract strategy and play by two players parties on a board with 8 rows and 8 columns and a set of distinct pieces for each side pieces typically appear coin like with a light and a dark face each side representing one player the goal for each player is to make pieces of their color constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game by turning over as many of their opponent s pieces as possible 
halftone is the reprographic technique that simulates continuous tone imagery through the use of dots varying either in size or in spacing halftone can also be used to refer specifically to the image that is produced by this process where continuous tone imagery contains an infinite range of colors or greys the halftone process reduces visual reproductions to a binary image that is printed with only one color of ink this binary reproduction relies on a basic optical illusion that these tiny halftone dots are blended into smooth tones by the human eye at a microscopic level developed black and white photographic film also consists of only two colors and not an infinite range of continuous tones for details see film grain just as color photography evolved with the addition of filters and film layers color printing is made possible by repeating the halftone process for each subtractive color most commonly using what is called the cmyk color model the semi opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create another optical effect full color imagery 
in mathematics the sieve of atkin is a fast modern algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer it is an optimized version of the ancient sieve of eratosthenes but does some preliminary work and then marks off multiples of primes squared rather than multiples of primes it was created by a o l atkin and daniel j bernstein 
intercal a programming language parody is the canonical esoteric programming language it was created by don woods and james m lyon two princeton university students in 1972 it satirizes aspects of the various programming languages at the time as well as the proliferation of proposed language constructs and notations in the 1960s consequently the humor may appear rather dated to modern readers brought up with c or java according to the original manual by the authors there are two currently maintained versions of intercal c intercal and clc intercal maintained by claudio calvelli 
in cryptography md5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function with a 128 bit hash value as an internet standard md5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files however it has been shown that md5 is not collision resistant as such md5 is not suitable for applications like ssl certificates or digital signatures that rely on this property an md5 hash is typically expressed as a 32 digit hexadecimal number md5 was designed by ron rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function md4 in 1996 a flaw was found with the design of md5 while it was not a clearly fatal weakness cryptographers began recommending the use of other algorithms such as sha 1 in 2004 more serious flaws were discovered making further use of the algorithm for security purposes questionable in 2007 a group of researchers including arjen lenstra described how to create a pair of files that share the same md5 checksum in an attack on md5 published in december 2008 a group of researchers used this technique to fake ssl certificate validity 
windbg is a multipurpose debugger for microsoft windows distributed on the web by microsoft it can be used to debug user mode applications drivers and the operating system itself in kernel mode it is a gui application but has little in common with the more well known but less powerful visual studio debugger windbg can be used for debugging kernel mode memory dumps created after what is commonly called the blue screen of death which occurs when a bug check is issued it can also be used to debug user mode crash dumps this is known as post mortem debugging windbg also has the ability to automatically load debugging symbol files from a server by matching various criteria this is a very helpful and time saving alternative to creating a symbol tree for a debugging target environment if a private symbol server is configured the symbols can be correlated with the source code for the binary this eases the burden of debugging problems that have various versions of binaries installed on the debugging target by eliminating the need for finding and installing specific symbols version on the debug host microsoft has a public symbol server that has most of the public symbols for windows 2000 and later versions of windows recent versions of windbg have been distributed as part of the free debugging tools for windows suite which shares a common debugging engine between windbg and command line debuggers like kd cdb and ntsd this means that most commands will work in all alternative versions without modification allowing users to use the style of interface with which they are most comfortable

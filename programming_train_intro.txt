in computer science duff s device is an optimized implementation of a serial copy that uses a technique widely applied in assembly language for loop unwinding its discovery is credited to tom duff in november of 1983 who at the time was working for lucasfilm it is perhaps the most dramatic use of case label fall through in the c programming language to date duff does not claim credit for discovering the concept of loop unrolling just this particular expression of it in c 
in computing service oriented architecture provides methods for systems development and integration where systems package functionality as interoperable services a soa infrastructure allows different applications to exchange data with one another service orientation aims at a loose coupling of services with operating systems programming languages and other technologies that underlie applications soa separates functions into distinct units or services which developers make accessible over a network in order that users can combine and reuse them in the production of applications these services communicate with each other by passing data from one service to another or by coordinating an activity between two or more services many commentators see soa concepts as built upon and evolving from older concepts of distributed computing and modular programming

the theory of computation is the branch of computer science that deals with whether and how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation using an algorithm the field is divided into two major branches computability theory and complexity theory but both branches deal with formal models of computation in order to perform a rigorous study of computation computer scientists work with a mathematical abstraction of computers called a model of computation there are several models in use but the most commonly examined is the turing machine a turing machine can be thought of as a desktop pc with a potentially infinite memory capacity though it can only access this memory in small discrete chunks computer scientists study the turing machine because it is simple to formulate can be analyzed and used to prove results and because it represents what many consider the most powerful possible reasonable model of computation it might seem that the potentially infinite memory capacity is an unrealizable attribute but any decidable problem solved by a turing machine will always require only a finite amount of memory so in principle any problem that can be solved by a turing machine can be solved by a computer that has a bounded amount of memory

in computer science object composition is a way to combine simple objects or data types into more complex ones compositions are a critical building block of many basic data structures including the tagged union the linked list and the binary tree as well as the object used in object oriented programming composited objects are often referred to as having a has a relationship a real world example of composition may be seen in an automobile the objects wheel steering wheel seat gearbox and engine may have no functionality by themselves but an object called automobile containing all of those objects would serve a higher function greater than the sum of its parts composition is contrasted with subtyping which is the process of adding detail to a general data type to create a more specific data type in composition the composite type has an object of a simpler type while in subtyping the subtype is an instance of its parent type composition does not form a subtype but a new type composited objects are called fields items members or attributes and the resulting composition a structure storage record tuple user defined type or composite type the terms usually vary across languages fields are given a unique name so that each one can be distinguished from the others sometimes an issue of ownership arises when a composition is destroyed should objects belonging to it be destroyed as well if not the case is sometimes called aggregation for more see the aggregation section below 
space colonization is the concept of autonomous human habitation of locations outside earth it is a major theme in science fiction as well as a long term goal of various national space programs while many people think of space colonies on the moon or mars others argue that the first colonies will be in orbit they have determined that there are ample quantities of all the necessary materials on the moon and near earth asteroids that solar energy is readily available in very large quantities in 2005 nasa administrator michael griffin identified space colonization as the ultimate goal of current spaceflight programs saying Â the goal isn t just scientific exploration  it s also about extending the range of human habitat out from earth into the solar system as we go forward in time  in the long run a single planet species will not survive  if we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years we must ultimately populate other planets now today the technology is such that this is barely conceivable we re in the infancy of it i m talking about that one day i don t know when that day is but there will be more human beings who live off the earth than on it we may well have people living on the moon we may have people living on the moons of jupiter and other planets we may have people making habitats on asteroids  i know that humans will colonize the solar system and one day go beyond michael d griffinas of 2008 the international space station provides a permanent yet still non autonomous human presence in space the nasa lunar outpost providing a permanent human presence on the moon is at the planning stage there is an ongoing development of technologies that may be used in future space colonization projects outer solar system

diffusion limited aggregation is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates of such particles this theory proposed by witten and sander in 1981 is applicable to aggregation in any system where diffusion is the primary means of transport in the system dla can be observed in many systems such as electrodeposition hele shaw flow mineral deposits and dielectric breakdown the clusters formed in dla processes are referred to as brownian trees these clusters are an example of a fractal in 2 d these fractals exhibit a dimension of approximately 1 71 for free particles that are unrestricted by a lattice however computer simulation of dla on a lattice will change the fractal dimension slightly for a dla in the same embedding dimension some variations are also observed depending on the geometry of the growth whether it be from a single point radially outward or from a plane or line for example computer simulation of dla is one of the primary means of studying this model several methods are available to accomplish this simulations can be done on a lattice of any desired geometry of embedding dimension in fact this has been done in up to 8 dimensions or the simulation can be done more along the lines of a standard molecular dynamics simulation where a particle is allowed to freely random walk until it gets within a certain critical range at which time it is pulled onto the cluster of critical importance is that the number of particles undergoing brownian motion in the system is kept very low so that only the diffusive nature of the system is present

in computing a protocol is a convention or standard that controls or enables the connection communication and data transfer between computing endpoints in its simplest form a protocol can be defined as the rules governing the syntax semantics and synchronization of communication protocols may be implemented by hardware software or a combination of the two at the lowest level a protocol defines the behavior of a hardware connection 
in computer science a linked list is one of the fundamental data structures and can be used to implement other data structures it consists of a sequence of nodes each containing arbitrary data fields and one or two references pointing to the next and or previous nodes the principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the order of the linked items may be different from the order that the data items are stored in memory or on disk allowing the list of items to be traversed in a different order a linked list is a self referential datatype because it contains a pointer or link to another datum of the same type linked lists permit insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list in constant time but do not allow random access several different types of linked list exist singly linked lists doubly linked lists and circularly linked lists linked lists can be implemented in most languages languages such as lisp and scheme have the data structure built in along with operations to access the linked list procedural or object oriented languages such as c c and java typically rely on mutable references to create linked lists 
in software development make is a utility for automatically building executable programs and libraries from source code files called makefiles specify how to derive the target program from each of its dependencies make typically decides where to start through topological sorting though integrated development environments and language specific compiler features can also be used to manage the build process in modern systems make remains widely used especially in unix based platforms 
a user interface markup language is a markup language that renders and describes graphical user interfaces and controls many of these markup languages are dialects of xml and are dependent upon a pre existing scripting language engine usually a javascript engine for rendering of controls and extra scriptability the concept of the user interface markup languages is primarily based upon the desire to prevent the re invention of the wheel in the design development and function of a user interface such re invention comes in the form of coding a script for the entire user interface the typical user interface markup language solidifies often re used program or script code in the form of markup making it easier to focus upon design of a user interface in an understandable dialect as opposed to focus on function user interface markup languages like most markup and programming languages rely upon sub application runtimes to interpret and render the markup code as program code that can be processed and put out in the desired form in xml based user interface markup languages which tend to rely upon a web browser s layout engine as a runtime most of the code is re interpreted to the layout engine as javascript this means that javascript can be used to extend the user interface markup languages to extents that are not covered by the present functionality of the layout engine

in computer jargon to slipstream updates patches or service packs means to integrate them into the installation files of their original software so that the resulting files will allow a direct installation of the updated software if not directly supported by the software vendor slipstreaming can be technically possible depending on the updates the structure and type of the program to be slipstreamed and of its installer if any in windows environments it is common for system administrators to make slipstreamed installation sources of the operating system available on network shares that greatly simplifies deployment for new installations microsoft also usually allows ordering slipstreamed cds from their website newer versions of microsoft products usually come either already slipstreamed or with a separate cd holding some updates slipstreaming can save time and money it is possible to add service packs and other updates and patches to the install source as well as extra drivers in a windows environment slipstreaming all needed drivers onto the install source will save time downloading them from the internet however if newer drivers are available then a new install source would be needed it also involves more work initially but can save time later on in reinstallation terms this is especially significant for administrators that have to manage a large number of computers where the default case for installing an operating system on each computer would be to use the original media and then update each computer after the installation was complete as opposed to using a more up to date source and having to download install a minimal number of updates adding patches to the install source is also another time saver however not all patches can be applied in this fashion and one disadvantage is that if it is discovered that a certain patch is responsible for later problems said patch cannot be removed without using an original non slipstreamed install cd online instructions for this way of doing things emphasise the use of virtual pc environments for testing as the end user often gets no support from the program manufacturer for using these homemade cds using slipstreamed os cds can avoid installation errors caused by drivers and hardware components 
the radian is a unit of plane angle equal to 180 Ï degrees or about 57 2958 degrees or about 57 17 45 it is the standard unit of angular measurement in all areas of mathematics beyond the elementary level the radian is represented by the symbol rad or more rarely by the superscript c for example an angle of 1 2 radians would be written as 1 2 rad or 1 2c however the radian is mathematically considered a pure number that needs no unit symbol and in mathematical writing the symbol rad is almost always omitted in the absence of any symbol radians are assumed and when degrees are meant the symbol is used the radian was formerly an si supplementary unit but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an si derived unit the si unit of solid angle measurement is the steradian 
in computing a persistent data structure is a data structure which always preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified such data structures are effectively immutable as their operations do not update the structure in place but instead always yield a new updated structure a persistent data structure is not a data structure committed to persistent storage such as a disk this is a different and unrelated sense of the word persistent a data structure is partially persistent if all versions can be accessed but only the newest version can be modified the data structure is fully persistent if every version can be both accessed and modified if there is also a meld or merge operation that can create a new version from two previous versions the data structure is called confluently persistent structures that are not persistent are called ephemeral these types of data structures are particularly common in logical and functional programming and in a purely functional program all data is immutable so all data structures are automatically fully persistent persistent data structures can also be created using in place updating of data and these may in general use less time or storage space than their purely functional counterparts while persistence can be achieved by simple copying this is inefficient in time and space because most operations make only small changes to a data structure a better method is to exploit the similarity between the new and old versions to share structure between them such as using the same subtree in a number of tree structures however because it rapidly becomes infeasible to determine how many previous versions share which parts of the structure and because it is often desirable to discard old versions this necessitates an environment with garbage collection perhaps the simplest persistent data structure is the singly linked list or cons based list a simple list of objects formed by each carrying a reference to the next in the list this is persistent because we can take a tail of the list meaning the last k items for some k and add new nodes on to the front of it the tail will not be duplicated instead becoming shared between both the old list and the new list so long as the contents of the tail are immutable this sharing will be invisible to the program many common reference based data structures such as red black trees and queues can easily be adapted to create a persistent version

the bellman ford algorithm a label correcting algorithm computes single source shortest paths in a weighted digraph dijkstra s algorithm solves the same problem with a lower running time but requires edge weights to be non negative thus bellman ford is usually used only when there are negative edge weights the algorithm was developed by richard bellman and lester ford jr according to robert sedgewick negative weights are not merely a mathematical curiosity arise in a natural way when we reduce other problems to shortest paths problems and he gives the specific example of a reduction from the np complete hamilton path problem to the shortest paths problem with general weights if a graph contains a cycle of total negative weight then arbitrarily low weights are achievable and so there s no solution bellman ford detects this case if the graph does contain a cycle of negative weights bellman ford can only detect this bellman ford cannot find the shortest path that does not repeat any vertex in such a graph this problem is at least as hard as the np complete longest path problem

in computer science a memory leak is a particular type of unintentional memory consumption by a computer program where the program fails to release memory when no longer needed this condition is normally the result of a bug in a program that prevents it from freeing up memory that it no longer needs this term has the potential to be confusing since memory is not physically lost from the computer rather memory is allocated to a program and that program subsequently loses the ability to access it due to program logic flaws a memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program source code however many people refer to any unwanted increase in memory usage as a memory leak even if this is not strictly accurate 
in computer science lexical analysis is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens programs performing lexical analysis are called lexical analyzers or lexers a lexer is often organized as separate scanner and tokenizer functions though the boundaries may not be clearly defined 
a decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences including chance event outcomes resource costs and utility decision trees are commonly used in operations research specifically in decision analysis to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal another use of description trees is as a descriptive means for calculating conditional probabilities in data mining and machine learning a decision tree is a predictive model that is a mapping from observations about an item to conclusions about its target value more descriptive names for such tree models are classification tree or regression tree in these tree structures leaves represent classifications and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those classifications the machine learning technique for inducing a decision tree from data is called decision tree learning or decision trees 
in mathematical optimization theory the simplex algorithm created by the american mathematician george dantzig in 1947 is a popular algorithm for numerical solution of the linear programming problem the journal computing in science and engineering listed it as one of the top 10 algorithms of the century an unrelated but similarly named method is the nelder mead method or downhill simplex method due to nelder mead and is a numerical method for optimizing many dimensional unconstrained problems belonging to the more general class of search algorithms in both cases the method uses the concept of a simplex which is a polytope of nÂ  Â 1 vertices in n dimensions a line segment in one dimension a triangle in two dimensions a tetrahedron in three dimensional space and so forth 
in algorithmic information theory the kolmogorov complexity of an object such as a piece of text is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object for example consider the following two strings of length 64 each containing only lowercase letters numbers and spaces the first string admits a short english language description namely ab 32 times which consists of 11 characters the second one has no obvious simple description other than writing down the string itself which has 64 characters more formally the complexity of a string is the length of the string s shortest description in some fixed universal description language the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below it can be shown that the kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be too much larger than the length of the string itself strings whose kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string s size are not considered to be complex the notion of kolmogorov complexity is surprisingly deep and can be used to state and prove impossibility results akin to gÃ¶del s incompleteness theorem and turing s halting problem 
in object oriented programming the command pattern is a design pattern in which an object is used to represent and encapsulate all the information needed to call a method at a later time this information includes the method name the object that owns the method and values for the method parameters three terms always associated with the command pattern are client invoker and receiver the client instantiates the command object and provides the information required to call the method at a later time the invoker decides when the method should be called the receiver is an instance of the class that contains the method s code using command objects makes it easier to construct general components that need to delegate sequence or execute method calls at a time of their choosing without the need to know the owner of the method or the method parameters

in computer science an interpreter normally means a computer program that executes i e performs instructions written in a programming language the terms interpreted language or compiled language merely mean that the canonical implementation of that language is an interpreter or a compiler a high level language is basically an abstraction which is independent of particular implementations while interpretation and compilation are the two principal means by which programming languages are implemented these are not fully distinct categories one of the reasons being that most interpreting systems also perform some translation work just like compilers an interpreter may be a program that eitherperl python matlab and ruby are examples of type 2 while ucsd pascal and java are type 3 the intermediate representation can be machine independent code which is then linked at run time and executed by an interpreter and or compiler general purpose market languages such as smalltalk java python and others generally employ jit 
in computer programming scope is an enclosing context where values and expressions are associated various programming languages have various types of scopes the type of scope determines what kind of entities it can contain and how it affects them or semantics typically scope is used to define the visibility and reach of information hiding scopes can a namespace is a scope that uses the enclosing nature of the scope to group logically related identifiers under a single identifier thus scopes can affect the name resolution for their contents variables are associated with scopes different scoping types affect how local variables are bound this has different consequences depending if the language has static or dynamic scoping 
in user interface design programming language design and ergonomics the principle of least astonishment states that when two elements of an interface conflict or are ambiguous the behaviour should be that which will least surprise the human user or programmer at the time the conflict arises for example a user interface may have the behaviour that pressing control q causes the program to quit the same user interface may have a facility for recording macros a sequence of keystrokes to be played back later intended to be able to control all aspects of the program the user may want to record a keystroke sequence that includes control q as part of the macro the principle says that pressing control q while recording a macro should not quit the program but rather should record the keystroke this practice also involves the application of sensible defaults

parallel computing is a form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones which are then solved concurrently there are several different forms of parallel computing bit level instruction level data and task parallelism parallelism has been employed for many years mainly in high performance computing but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling as power consumption by computers has become a concern in recent years parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture mainly in the form of multicore processors parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism with multi core and multi processor computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine while clusters mpps and grids use multiple computers to work on the same task specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors for accelerating specific tasks parallel computer programs are more difficult to write than sequential ones because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs of which race conditions are the most common communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically one of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance the speed up of a program as a result of parallelization is governed by amdahl s law 
a skip list is a probabilistic data structure based on multiple parallel sorted linked lists with efficiency comparable to a binary search tree underlying the skip list is an augmentation of an ordered linked list with additional forward links added in a randomized way with a geometric negative binomial distribution so that a search in the list may quickly skip parts of the list insert search and delete operations are performed in logarithmic randomized time 
in computer science a fiber is a particularly lightweight thread of execution like threads fibers share address space where a distinction exists it is that fibers use co operative multitasking while threads use pre emptive multitasking threads often depend on the kernel s thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and resume another thread fibers yield themselves to run another fiber while executing the article on threads contains more on the distinction between threads and fibers 
pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one keyboard one types in code while the other reviews each line of code as it s typed in the person typing is called the driver the person reviewing the code is called the observer or navigator the two programmers switch roles frequently while reviewing the observer also considers the strategic direction of the work coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address this frees the driver to focus all of his or her attention on the tactical aspects of completing the current task using the observer as a safety net and guide 
jscript is the microsoft dialect of the ecmascript scripting language specification javascript jscript and ecmascript are very similar languages in fact the name javascript is often used to refer to ecmascript or jscript javascript is used on web pages for scripting although it can be and is also used in other embedding scenarios jscript is implemented as a windows script engine this means that it can be plugged in to any application that supports windows script such as internet explorer active server pages and windows script host it also means that any application supporting windows script can use multiple languages jscript vbscript perl and others jscript was first supported in internet explorer 3 0 browser released in august 1996 the typical file extension of jscript source code files is js the most recent version of jscript is jscript net which is based on the yet unfinished edition 4 of the ecmascript standard and can be compiled for the microsoft net platform jscript net adds several new features to ecmascript ed 3 such as optional static type annotations

a state diagram is a type of diagram used in computer science and related fields to describe the behavior of systems state diagrams require that the system described is composed of a finite number of states sometimes this is indeed the case while at other times this is a reasonable abstraction there are many forms of state diagrams which differ slightly and have different semantics 
the canvas element is part of html5 and allows for dynamic scriptable rendering of bitmap images it was initially introduced by apple for use inside their own mac os x webkit component powering applications like dashboard widgets and the safari browser later it was adopted by gecko browsers opera and chrome and standardized by the whatwg on new proposed specifications for next generation web technologies novell manufactures an xforms processor plugin for internet explorer which also provides support for the canvas element independent efforts to support the canvas feature on internet explorer do not require plugins and are based solely on vml and javascript google has also begun a project to add canvas abilities to internet explorer using the same techniques canvas consists of a drawable region defined in html code with height and width attributes javascript code may access the area through a full set of drawing functions similar to other common 2d apis thus allowing for dynamically generated graphics some anticipated uses of the canvas include building graphs animations games and image composition 
active directory is a technology created by microsoft that provides a variety of network services including using the same database for use primarily in windows environments active directory also allows administrators to assign policies deploy software and apply critical updates to an organization active directory stores information and settings in a central database active directory networks can vary from a small installation with a few computers users and printers to tens of thousands of users many different domains and large server farms spanning many geographical locations active directory was previewed in 1999 released first with windows 2000 server edition and revised to extend functionality and improve administration in windows server 2003 additional improvements were made in both windows server 2003 r2 and windows server 2008 active directory was called ntds in older microsoft documents this name can still be seen in some ad binaries there is a common misconception that active directory provides software distribution software distribution is run by a separate service that uses additional proprietary schema attributes that work in conjunction with the ldap protocol active directory does not automate software distribution but provides a mechanism by which other services can provide software distribution 
constraint programming is a programming paradigm where relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints constraints differ from the common primitives of imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute but rather the properties of a solution to be found this makes constraint programming a form of declarative programming the constraints used in constraint programming are of various kinds those used in constraint satisfaction problems those solved by the simplex algorithm and others constraints are usually embedded within a programming language or provided via separate software libraries constraint programming began with constraint logic programming which embeds constraints into a logic program this variant of logic programming is due to jaffar and lassez who extended in 1987 a specific class of constraints that were introduced in prolog ii the first implementations of constraint logic programming were prolog iii clp and chip several constraint logic programming interpreters exist today for example gnu prolog other than logic programming constraints can be mixed with functional programming term rewriting and imperative languages programming languages with built in support for constraints include oz and kaleidoscope mostly constraints are implemented in imperative languages via constraint solving toolkits which are separate libraries for an existing imperative language 
supervised learning is a machine learning technique for learning a function from training data the training data consist of pairs of input objects and desired outputs the output of the function can be a continuous value or can predict a class label of the input object the task of the supervised learner is to predict the value of the function for any valid input object after having seen a number of training examples to achieve this the learner has to generalize from the presented data to unseen situations in a reasonable way the parallel task in human and animal psychology is often referred to as concept learning 
in mathematics a golomb ruler is a set of marks at integer positions along an imaginary ruler such that no two pairs of marks are the same distance apart the number of marks on the ruler is its order and the largest distance between two of its marks is its length translation and reflection of a golomb ruler are considered trivial so the smallest mark is customarily put at 0 and the next mark at the smaller of its two possible values the golomb ruler was named for solomon w golomb and discovered independently by sidon and babcock there is no requirement that a golomb ruler be able to measure all distances up to its length but if it does it is called a perfect golomb ruler it has been proven that no perfect golomb ruler exists for five or more marks a golomb ruler is optimal if no shorter golomb ruler of the same order exists creating golomb rulers is easy but finding the optimal golomb rulers for a specified order is computationally very challenging distributed net has completed distributed massively parallel searches for optimal order 24 order 25 and order 26 golomb rulers confirming the suspected candidates distributed net also has plans to find optimal golomb rulers of order 27 and order 28 however they are not expected to take as long as the previous projects due to the discovery of an improved algorithm currently the search for the order 27 ruler is underway the expected time to finish it is about seven years one practical use of golomb rulers is in the design of phased array radio antennas such as radio telescopes antennas in a golomb ruler configuration can often be seen at cell sites currently the complexity of finding optimal golomb rulers of arbitrary order n is unknown but it is believed to be an np hard problem 
nmea 0183 is a combined electrical and data specification for communication between marine electronic devices such as echo sounder sonars anemometer gyrocompass autopilot gps receivers and many other types of instruments it has been defined by and is controlled by the u s based national marine electronics association the nmea 0183 standard uses a simple ascii serial communications protocol that defines how data is transmitted in a sentence from one talker to multiple listeners at a time through the use of intermediate expanders a talker can have a unidirectional conversation with a nearly unlimited number of listeners and using multiplexers multiple sensors can talk to a single computer port third party switches are available that can establish a primary and secondary talker with automatic failover if the primary fails at the application layer the standard also defines the contents of each sentence type so that all listeners can parse messages accurately 
tmpfs is a common name for a temporary file storage facility on many unix like operating systems it is intended to appear as a mounted file system but one which uses virtual memory instead of a persistent storage device 
in computer programming the strategy pattern is a particular software design pattern whereby algorithms can be selected at runtime in some programming languages such as those without polymorphism the issues addressed by this pattern are handled through forms of reflection such as the native function pointer or function delegate syntax this pattern is invisible in languages with first class functions see the python code for an example the strategy pattern is useful for situations where it is necessary to dynamically swap the algorithms used in an application the strategy pattern is intended to provide a means to define a family of algorithms encapsulate each one as an object and make them interchangeable the strategy pattern lets the algorithms vary independently from clients that use them 
the great circle distance is the shortest distance between any two points on the surface of a sphere measured along a path on the surface of the sphere because spherical geometry is rather different from ordinary euclidean geometry the equations for distance take on a different form the distance between two points in euclidean space is the length of a straight line from one point to the other on the sphere however there are no straight lines in non euclidean geometry straight lines are replaced with geodesics geodesics on the sphere are the great circles between any two points on a sphere which are not directly opposite each other there is a unique great circle the two points separate the great circle into two arcs the length of the shorter arc is the great circle distance between the points a great circle endowed with such a distance is the riemannian circle between two points which are directly opposite each other called antipodal points there are infinitely many great circles but all great circle arcs between antipodal points have the same length i e half the circumference of the circle or Ïr where r is the radius of the sphere because the earth is approximately spherical the equations for great circle distance are important for finding the shortest distance between points on the surface of the earth and so have important applications in navigation

flyweight is a software design pattern a flyweight is an object that minimizes memory use by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects it is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory often some parts of the object state can be shared and it s common to put them in external data structures and pass them to the flyweight objects temporarily when they are used a classic example usage of the flyweight pattern are the data structures for graphical representation of characters in a word processor it would be nice to have for each character in a document a glyph object containing its font outline font metrics and other formatting data but it would amount to hundreds or thousands of bytes for each character instead for every character there might be a reference to a flyweight glyph object shared by every instance of the same character in the document only the position of each character would need to be stored externally 
in theoretical computer science formal semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages and models of computation the formal semantics of a language is given by a mathematical model that describes the possible computations described by the language there are many approaches to formal semantics these approaches belong to three major classes the distinctions between the three broad classes of approaches can sometimes be blurry but all known approaches to formal semantics use the above techniques or some combination thereof apart from the choice between denotational operational or axiomatic approaches most variation in formal semantic systems arises from the choice of supporting mathematical formalism some variations of formal semantics include the following for a variety of reasons one might wish to describe the relationships between different formal semantics for example one can sometimes relate multiple semantics through abstractions via the theory of abstract interpretation the field of formal semantics encompasses all of the following it has close links with other areas of computer science such as programming language design type theory compilers and interpreters program verification and model checking 
andrew stuart andy tanenbaum is a professor of computer science at the vrije universiteit amsterdam in the netherlands he is best known as the author of minix a free unix like operating system for teaching purposes and for his computer science textbooks regarded as standard texts in the field he regards his teaching job as his most important work 
lanczos resampling is a multivariate interpolation method used to compute new values for any digitally sampled data it is often used for image scaling but could be used for any other digital signal in the case of digital image resizing the lanczos function indicates which pixels in the original image and in what proportion make up each pixel of the final image the filter is named after cornelius lanczos because he showed how to use fourier series and chebyshev polynomials for various problems where it was not used before 
the c standard library consists of a set of sections of the iso c standard which describe a collection of header files and library routines used to implement common operations such as input output and string handling in the c programming language the c standard library is an interface standard described by a document it is not an actual library of software routines available for linkage to c programs no such implementation is properly called c standard library note there is the term c library which may either informally be used as a synonym for c standard library or may refer to to a particular implementation which provides the c standard library features and other features or to any library whatsoever which has an interface for linking to c programs the term c run time library is used on some platforms to refer to a set of base libraries which may be distributed in dynamically linkable form with an operating system or distributed with a c compiler another term sometimes used is libc not just any library is called the run time library run time in this context means the run time support package associated with a compiler which is understood to make a language complete the run time support provides not only the c standard library functions but possibly other material needed create an environment for the c program such as initialization prior to the invocation of the main function or subroutines to provide arithmetic operations missing from the cpu that are needed by code generated by the c compiler

the minimum description length principle is a formalization of occam s razor in which the best hypothesis for a given set of data is the one that leads to the largest compression of the data mdl was introduced by jorma rissanen in 1978 it is an important concept in information theory and learning theory any set of data can be represented by a string of symbols from a finite alphabet the fundamental idea behind the mdl principle is that any regularity in a given set of data can be used to compress the data i e to describe it using fewer symbols than needed to describe the data literally since we want to select the hypothesis that captures the most regularity in the data we look for the hypothesis with which the best compression can be achieved in order to do this we must first fix a code to compress the data the most general way to do this is to choose a computer language we then write a program in that language that outputs the data this program thus represents the data the length of the shortest program that outputs the data is called the kolmogorov complexity of the data this is the central idea of ray solomonoff s idealized theory of inductive inference however this mathematical theory does not provide a practical way of doing inference the most important reasons for this are mdl is an attempt to remedy these by rather than programs in mdl theory one usually speaks of candidate hypotheses models or codes the set of allowed codes is then called the model class the code is then selected for which the sum of the description of the code and the description of the data with the help of the code is minimal one of the important properties of mdl methods is that they provide a natural safeguard against overfitting because it implements a tradeoff between the complexity of the hypothesis and the complexity of the data given the hypothesis to see why this is true consider the following example suppose you flip a coin 1 000 times and you observe the numbers of heads and tails we consider two model classes the first consists of a code that represents each outcome with a 0 for heads or a 1 for tails this code represents the hypothesis that the coin is fair the code length according to this code is always exactly 1 000 bits the second model class consists of all codes that are efficient for a coin with some specific bias representing the hypothesis that the coin is not fair say that we observe 510 heads and 490 tails then the code length according to the best code in the second model class is shorter than 1 000 bits for this reason a naive statistical method might put forward this second hypothesis as a better explanation for the data however in an mdl approach we would have to construct a single code based on the hypothesis we cannot just use the best one a simple way to do it would be to use a two part code in which we first specify which element of the model class has the best performance and then we specify the data using that code we will need quite a lot of bits to specify which code to use thus the total codelength based on the second model class would be larger than 1 000 bits thus if you follow an mdl approach the conclusion has to be that there is not enough evidence in support of the hypothesis that the coin is biased even though the best element of the second model class provides better fit to the data central to mdl theory is the one to one correspondence between code length functions and probability distributions for any probability distribution p it is possible to construct a code c such that the length of c is equal to log2p this code minimizes the expected code length vice versa given a code c one can construct a probability distribution p such that the same holds in other words searching for an efficient code reduces to searching for a good probability distribution and vice versa 
secure shell or ssh is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices used primarily on linux and unix based systems to access shell accounts ssh was designed as a replacement for telnet and other insecure remote shells which send information notably passwords in plaintext leaving them open for interception the encryption used by ssh provides confidentiality and integrity of data over an insecure network such as the internet 
in computer science tail recursion is a special case of recursion in which the last operation of the function the tail call is a recursive call such recursions can be easily transformed to iterations replacing recursion with iteration manually or automatically can drastically decrease the amount of stack space used and improve efficiency this technique is commonly used with functional programming languages where the declarative approach and explicit handling of state promote the use of recursive functions that would otherwise rapidly fill the call stack 
in computer programming the adapter design pattern translates one interface for a class into a compatible interface an adapter allows classes to work together that normally could not because of incompatible interfaces by providing its interface to clients while using the original interface the adapter translates calls to its interface into calls to the original interface and the amount of code necessary to do this is typically small the adapter is also responsible for transforming data into appropriate forms for instance if multiple boolean values are stored as a single integer but your consumer requires a true false the adapter would be responsible for extracting the appropriate values from the integer value 
fastcgi is a protocol for interfacing interactive programs with a web server fastcgi is a variation on the earlier common gateway interface fastcgi s main aim is to reduce the overhead associated with interfacing the web server and cgi programs allowing a server to handle more web page requests at once

perpetual beta is a term used to describe software or a system which never leaves the development stage of beta it is often used by developers in order to allow them to constantly release new features that might not be fully tested as a result perpetual beta software is not recommended for mission critical machines 
test automation is the use of software to control the execution of tests the comparison of actual outcomes to predicted outcomes the setting up of test preconditions and other test control and test reporting functions commonly test automation involves automating a manual process already in place that uses a formalized testing process 
direct3d is part of microsoft s directx api direct3d is only available for microsoft s various windows operating systems and is the base for the graphics api on the xbox and xbox 360 console systems direct3d is used to render three dimensional graphics in applications where performance is important such as games direct3d also allows applications to run fullscreen instead of embedded in a window though they can still run in a window if programmed for that feature direct3d uses hardware acceleration if it is available on the graphics card allowing for hardware acceleration of the entire 3d rendering pipeline or even only partial acceleration direct3d exposes the advanced graphics capabilities of 3d graphics hardware including z buffering anti aliasing alpha blending mipmapping atmospheric effects and perspective correct texture mapping integration with other directx technologies enables direct3d to deliver such features as video mapping hardware 3d rendering in 2d overlay planes and even sprites providing the use of 2d and 3d graphics in interactive media titles direct3d is a 3d api that is it contains many commands for 3d rendering however since version 8 direct3d has superseded the old directdraw framework and also taken responsibility for the rendering of 2d graphics microsoft strives to continually update direct3d to support the latest technology available on 3d graphics cards direct3d offers full vertex software emulation but no pixel software emulation for features not available in hardware for example if software programmed using direct3d requires pixel shaders and the video card on the user s computer does not support that feature direct3d will not emulate it although it will compute and render the polygons and textures of the 3d models albeit at a usually degraded quality and performance compared to the hardware equivalent the api does define a reference rasterizer which emulates a generic graphics card in software although it is too slow for most real time 3d applications and is typically only used for debugging direct3d s main competitor is opengl there are numerous features and issues that proponents for either api disagree over see comparison of direct3d and opengl for a summary 
in computer programming cohesion is a measure of how strongly related and focused the various responsibilities of a software module are cohesion is an ordinal type of measurement and is usually expressed as high cohesion or low cohesion when being discussed modules with high cohesion tend to be preferable because high cohesion is associated with several desirable traits of software including robustness reliability reusability and understandability whereas low cohesion is associated with undesirable traits such as being difficult to maintain difficult to test difficult to reuse and even difficult to understand cohesion is often contrasted with coupling a different concept nonetheless high cohesion often correlates with loose coupling and vice versa the software quality metrics of coupling and cohesion were invented by larry constantine based on characteristics of good programming practices that reduced maintenance and modification costs 
american standard code for information interchange pronounced ËÃ¦ski is a coding standard that can be used for interchanging information if the information is expressed mainly by the written form of english words it is implemented as a character encoding scheme based on the ordering of the english alphabet ascii codes represent text in computers communications equipment and other devices that work with text most modern character encoding schemes which support many more characters than did the original have a historical basis in ascii historically ascii developed from telegraphic codes its first commercial use was as a seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services work on ascii formally began october 6 1960 with the first meeting of the american standards association s x3 2 subcommittee the first edition of the standard was published in 1963 a major revision in 1967 and the most recent update in 1986 compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters ascii includes definitions for 128 characters 33 are non printing mostly obsolete control characters that affect how text is processed 94 are printable characters and the space is considered an invisible graphic the most commonly used character encoding on the world wide web was us ascii until 2008 when it was surpassed by utf 8

various code driven testing frameworks have come to be known collectively as xunit these frameworks allow testing of different elements of software such as functions and classes the main advantage of xunit frameworks is that they provide an automated solution with no need to write the same tests many times and no need to remember what should be the result of each test such frameworks are based on a design by kent beck originally implemented for smalltalk as sunit but are now available for many programming languages and development platforms 
openid is an open decentralized standard for user authentication and access control allowing users to log onto many services with the same digital identity as such it replaces the common login process that uses a login name and a password by allowing a user to log in once and gain access to the resources of multiple software systems an openid is in the form of a unique url and is authenticated by the user s openid provider the openid protocol does not rely on a central authority to authenticate a user s identity since neither the openid protocol nor web sites requiring identification may mandate a specific type of authentication non standard forms of authentication can be used such as smart cards biometrics or ordinary passwords openid authentication is used and provided by several large websites organizations like aol bbc google ibm microsoft myspace orange paypal verisign yandex ustream and yahoo act as providers 
a self replicating machine is an artificial construct that is theoretically capable of autonomously manufacturing a copy of itself using raw materials taken from its environment the concept of self replicating machines has been advanced and examined by homer jacobsen edward f moore freeman dyson john von neumann and in more recent times by k eric drexler in his book on nanotechnology engines of creation and by robert freitas and ralph merkle in their review kinematic self replicating machines which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator design space the future development of such technology has featured as an integral part of several plans involving the mining of moons and asteroid belts for ore and other materials the creation of lunar factories and even the construction of solar power satellites in space the possibly misnamed von neumann probe is one theoretical example of such a machine von neumann also worked on what he called the universal constructor a self replicating machine that would operate in a cellular automata environment a self replicating machine is as the name suggests an artificial self replicating system that relies on conventional large scale technology and automation certain idiosyncratic terms are occasionally found in the literature for example the term clanking replicator was once used by drexler to distinguish macroscale replicating systems from the microscopic nanorobots or assemblers that nanotechnology may make possible but the term is informal and is rarely used by others in popular or technical discussions replicators have also been called von neumann machines after john von neumann who first rigorously studied the idea but this term is less specific and also refers to a completely unrelated computer architecture proposed by von neumann so its use is discouraged where accuracy is important von neumann himself used the term universal constructor to describe such self replicating machines 
metapost refers to both a programming language and the only known interpreter of the metapost programming language both are derived from donald knuth s metafont language and interpreter metapost excels at producing diagrams in the postscript programming language from a geometric algebraic description the language shares metafont s elegant declarative syntax for manipulating lines curves points and geometric transformations however many of the limitations of metapost derive from features of metafont for instance numbers have a low precision fixed point representation sufficient for representing the coordinates of points in a glyph and this can be restrictive when working with figures in a larger coordinate space moreover metapost does not support all features of postscript most notably paths can have only one segment and regions only be filled with uniform colours postscript level 1 supports tiled patterns and postscript 3 supports gouraud shading to this end the asymptote graphics language has been developed to address these shortcomings

memory barrier also known as membar or memory fence is a class of instructions which cause a central processing unit to enforce an ordering constraint on memory operations issued before and after the barrier instruction cpus employ performance optimizations that can result in out of order execution including memory load and store operations memory operation reordering normally goes unnoticed within a single thread of execution but causes unpredictable behaviour in concurrent programs and device drivers unless carefully controlled the exact nature of an ordering constraint is hardware dependent and defined by the architecture s memory model some architectures provide multiple barriers for enforcing different ordering constraints memory barriers are typically used when implementing low level machine code that operates on memory shared by multiple devices such code includes synchronization primitives and lock free data structures on multiprocessor systems and device drivers that communicate with computer hardware 
in computer science self modifying code is code that alters its own instructions while it is executing usually to reduce the instruction path length and improve performance or simply to reduce otherwise repetitively similar code thus simplify maintenance self modification is an alternative to the method of flag setting and conditional program branching used primarily to reduce the number of times a condition needs to be tested for the method is frequently used for conditionally invoking test debugging code without requiring additional overhead for every input output cycle and also in just in time compilers the modifications may be performed in either case the modifications may be performed directly to the machine code instructions themselves by overlaying new instructions over the existing ones

release management defines the mechanisms of building and releasing software and is included as a component of the service support set in itil the practice of release management continues to evolve while being applied to complex distributed software services such as in the soa realm release management is proactive technical support focused on the planning and preparation of new services some of the benefits are 
 the opportunity to plan expenditure and resource requirements in advance
 a structured approach to rolling out all new software or hardware which efficient and effective
 changes to software are bundled together for one release which minimises the impact of changes on users
 testing before rollout which minimises incidents affecting users and requires less reactive supportthe need therefore exists for dedicated resources to oversee the integration and flow of development testing deployment and support of these systems although project managers have done this in the past they generally are more concerned with high level grand design aspects of a project or application and so often do not have time to oversee some of the more technical or day to day aspects release managers address this need they must have a general knowledge of every aspect of the software development lifecycle various applicable operating systems and software application or platforms as well as various business functions and perspectives 
the javascript series the syntax of javascript is a set of rules that defines what constitutes a valid program in the javascript language note the examples below often use an alert function to return standard text output the javascript standard library lacks an official standard text output function however given that javascript is mainly used as a client side scripting language within modern web browsers and that almost all web browsers provide access to the alert function alert is included in our examples

in computing a core dump consists of the recorded state of the working memory of a computer program at a specific time generally when the program has terminated abnormally in practice other key pieces of program state are usually dumped at the same time including the processor registers which may include the program counter and stack pointer memory management information and other processor and operating system flags and information the name comes from the once standard core memory technology core dumps are often used to diagnose or debug errors in computer programs on many operating systems a fatal error in a program automatically triggers a core dump and by extension the phrase to dump core has come to mean in many cases any fatal error regardless of whether a record of the program memory results the term core dump has become jargon to indicate any deposition of a large amount of unedited data for further examination 
camelcase or medial capitals is the practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the words are joined without spaces and are capitalized within the compound as in labelle backcolor or ipod the name comes from the uppercase bumps in the middle of the compound word suggestive of the humps of a camel the practice is known by many other names camel case is a standard identifier naming convention for several programming languages and has become fashionable in marketing for names of products and companies however camel case is rarely used in formal written english and most style guides recommend against its use 
document classification categorization is a problem in information science the task is to assign an electronic document to one or more categories based on its contents document classification tasks can be divided into two sorts supervised document classification where some external mechanism provides information on the correct classification for documents and unsupervised document classification where the classification must be done entirely without reference to external information there is also a semi supervised document classification where parts of the documents are labeled by the external mechanism

the user datagram protocol is one of the core members of the internet protocol suite the set of network protocols used for the internet with udp computer applications can send messages in this case referred to as datagrams to other hosts on an internet protocol network without requiring prior communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths udp is sometimes called the universal datagram protocol the protocol was designed by david p reed in 1980 and formally defined in rfc 768 udp uses a simple transmission model without implicit hand shaking dialogues for guaranteeing reliability ordering or data integrity thus udp provides an unreliable service and datagrams may arrive out of order appear duplicated or go missing without notice udp assumes that error checking and correction is either not necessary or performed in the application avoiding the overhead of such processing at the network interface level time sensitive applications often use udp because dropping packets is preferable to using delayed packets if error correction facilities are needed at the network interface level an application may use the transmission control protocol or stream control transmission protocol which are designed for this purpose udp s stateless nature is also useful for servers that answer small queries from huge numbers of clients unlike tcp udp is compatible with packet broadcast and multicasting common network applications that use udp include the domain name system streaming media applications such as iptv voice over ip trivial file transfer protocol and many online games

strong authentication is a notion with several unofficial definitions is not standardized in the security literature often strong authentication is associated with two factor authentication or more generally multi factor authentication this is the case with the definition found in the committee of national security systems glossary cnssi 4009 another commonly found class of definitions relates to a cryptographic process or more precisely authentication based on a challenge response protocol this type of definition is found in the handbook of applied cryptography this type of definition does not necessarily relate to two factor authentication since the secret key used in a challenge response authentication scheme can be simply derived from a password a third class of definitions says that strong authentication is any form of authentication in which the verification is accomplished without the transmission of a password this is the case for example with the definition found in the fermilab documentation thus the term strong authentication can be used as long as the notion strong is defined in the context of use

in cryptography the one time pad is an encryption algorithm where the plaintext is combined with a random key or pad that is as long as the plaintext and used only once a modular addition is used to combine the plaintext with the pad it was invented in 1917 and patented a couple of years later if the key is truly random never reused and kept secret the one time pad provides perfect secrecy it has also been proven that any cipher with perfect secrecy must use keys with the same requirements as otp keys the key normally consists of a random stream of numbers each of which indicates the number of places in the alphabet which the corresponding letter or number in the plaintext message should be shifted for messages in the latin alphabet for example the key will consist of a random string of numbers between 0 and 25 for binary messages the key will consist of a random string of 0s and 1s and so on the pad part of the name comes from early implementations where the key material was distributed as a pad of paper so the top sheet could be easily torn off and destroyed after use for easy concealment the pad was sometimes reduced to such a small size that a powerful magnifying glass was required to use it photos accessible on the internet show captured kgb pads that fit in the palm of one s hand or in a walnut shell to increase security one time pads were sometimes printed onto sheets of highly flammable nitrocellulose the one time pad is derived from the vernam cipher named after gilbert vernam one of its inventors vernam s system was a cipher that combined a message with a key read from a paper tape loop in its original form vernam s system was not unbreakable because the key could be reused one time use came a little later when joseph mauborgne recognized that if the key tape was totally random cryptanalytic difficulty would be increased there is some ambiguity to the term due to the fact that some authors use the term vernam cipher synonymously for the one time pad while others refer to any additive stream cipher as a vernam cipher including those based on a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator

spaghetti code is a pejorative term for source code which has a complex and tangled control structure especially one using many gotos exceptions threads or other unstructured branching constructs it is named such because program flow tends to look like a bowl of spaghetti i e twisted and tangled spaghetti code can be caused by several factors including inexperienced programmers and a complex program which has been continuously modified over a long life cycle structured programming greatly decreased the incidence of spaghetti code and is widely regarded as one of the most important advances in programming history 
in computer science hierarchical protection domains often called protection rings are a mechanism to protect data and functionality from faults and malicious behaviour this approach is diametrically opposite to that of capability based security computer operating systems provide different levels of access to resources a protection ring is one of two or more hierarchical levels or layers of privilege within the architecture of a computer system this is generally hardware enforced by some cpu architectures that provide different cpu modes at the firmware level rings are arranged in a hierarchy from most privileged to least privileged on most operating systems ring 0 is the level with the most privileges and interacts most directly with the physical hardware such as the cpu and memory special gates between rings are provided to allow an outer ring to access an inner ring s resources in a predefined manner as opposed to allowing arbitrary usage correctly gating access between rings can improve security by preventing programs from one ring or privilege level from misusing resources intended for programs in another for example spyware running as a user program in ring 3 should be prevented from turning on a web camera without informing the user since hardware access should be a ring 1 function reserved for device drivers programs such as web browsers running in higher numbered rings must request access to the network a resource restricted to a lower numbered ring

in computing a hacker is a person in one of several distinct communities and subcultures today mainstream usage mostly refers to computer criminals due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1980s this includes script kiddies people breaking into computers using programs written by others with very little knowledge about the way they work this usage is so much predominant in the general public that a large segment of it is unaware that different meanings also exist while the use of the word by hobbyist hackers is acknowledged by all three kinds of hackers and the computer security hackers accept all uses of the word free software hackers consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect and refer to security breakers as crackers 
apl is an array programming language based on a notation invented in 1957 by kenneth e iverson while at harvard university it originated as an attempt to provide consistent notation for the teaching and analysis of topics related to the application of computers iverson published his notation in 1962 in a book titled a programming language by 1965 a subset of the notation was implemented as a programming language then known as ivsys later prior to its commercial release apl got its name from the title of the book iverson received the turing award in 1979 for his work iverson s notation was later used to describe the ibm system 360 machine architecture a description much more concise and exact than the existing documentation and revealing several previously unnoticed problems later a selectric typeball was specially designed to write a linear representation of this notation this distinctive aspect of apl the use of a special character set visually depicting the operations to be performed remains fundamentally unchanged today the apl language features a rich set of operations which work on entire arrays of data like the vector instruction set of a simd architecture while many computer languages would require iteration to add two arrays together functions in apl typically deal with entire arrays at once in conjunction with a special character set where glyphs represent operations to be performed this drastically reduces the potential number of loops and allows for smaller more concise and compact programs as with all programming languages that have had several decades of continual use apl has evolved significantly generally in an upward compatible manner from its earlier releases apl is usually interpretive and interactive and normally features a read evaluate print loop for command and expression input today nearly all modern implementations support structured programming while several dialects now feature some form of object oriented programming constructs in the early 1990s iverson along with roger hui redesigned the apl language calling the update the j programming language j removed the requirement for the special character set fixed some ambiguous syntax and added support for john backus functional programming ideas 
the karnaugh map also known as a veitch diagram is a tool to facilitate the simplification of boolean algebra integrated circuit expressions the karnaugh map reduces the need for extensive calculations by taking advantage of human pattern recognition and permitting the rapid identification and elimination of potential race hazards the karnaugh map was invented in 1952 by edward w veitch it was further developed in 1953 by maurice karnaugh a physicist at bell labs to help simplify digital electronic circuits in a karnaugh map the boolean variables are transferred and ordered according to the principles of gray code in which only one variable changes in between squares once the table is generated and the output possibilities are transcribed the data is arranged into the largest even group possible and the minterm is generated through the axiom laws of boolean algebra 
in the microsoft net framework an assembly is a partially compiled code library for use in deployment versioning and security in the microsoft windows implementation of net an assembly is a pe file for windows gui on intel x86 there are two types process assemblies and library assemblies a process assembly represents a process which will use classes defined in library assemblies net assemblies contain code in cil which is usually generated from net languages and then compiled into machine language at runtime by the clr just in time compiler an assembly can consist of one or more files code files are called modules an assembly can contain more than one code module and since it is possible to use different languages to create code modules it is technically possible to use several different languages to create an assembly visual studio however does not support using different languages in one assembly 
insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm a comparison sort in which the sorted array is built one entry at a time it is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort heapsort or merge sort however insertion sort provides several advantages most humans when sorting ordering a deck of cards for example use a method that is similar to insertion sort 
distributed hash tables are a class of decentralized distributed systems that provide a lookup service similar to a hash table pairs are stored in the dht and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is distributed among the nodes in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption this allows dhts to scale to extremely large numbers of nodes and to handle continual node arrivals departures and failures dhts form an infrastructure that can be used to build more complex services such as distributed file systems peer to peer file sharing and content distribution systems cooperative web caching multicast anycast domain name services and instant messaging notable distributed networks that use dhts include bittorrent s distributed tracker the edonkey network the storm botnet yacy and the coral content distribution network 
syncml is the former name for a platform independent information synchronization standard existing synchronization solutions have mostly been somewhat vendor application or operating system specific the purpose of syncml is to change this by offering an open standard as a replacement several major companies such as motorola nokia sony ericsson lg ibm and siemens ag already support syncml in their products although lg do not support it in all their phone models preferring to use their own proprietary syncing protocols such as lg sync spp philippe kahn was instrumental in the founding vision for synchronization with starfish software later acquired by motorola the founding vision as expressed by kahn was global synchronization and integration of wireless and wireline devices syncml is most commonly thought of as a method to synchronize contact and calendar information between some type of handheld device and a computer such as between a mobile phone and a personal computer the new version of the specification includes support for push email providing a standard protocol alternative to proprietary solutions like blackberry some products are now using syncml for more general information synchronization purposes such as to synchronize project task information across a distributed group of team members syncml can also be used as a base for backup solutions

in cryptography the avalanche effect refers to a desirable property of cryptographic algorithms typically block ciphers and cryptographic hash functions the avalanche effect is evident if when an input is changed slightly the output changes significantly in the case of quality block ciphers such a small change in either the key or the plaintext should cause a drastic change in the ciphertext the actual term was first used by horst feistel although the concept dates back to at least shannon s diffusion if a block cipher or cryptographic hash function does not exhibit the avalanche effect to a significant degree then it has poor randomization and thus a cryptanalyst can make predictions about the input being given only the output this may be sufficient to partially or completely break the algorithm thus the avalanche effect is a desirable condition from the point of view of the designer of the cryptographic algorithm or device constructing a cipher or hash to exhibit a substantial avalanche effect is one of the primary design objectives this is why most block ciphers are product ciphers it is also why hash functions have large data blocks both of these features allow small changes to propagate rapidly through iterations of the algorithm such that every bit of the output should depend on every bit of the input before the algorithm terminates 
in web development comet is a neologism to describe a web application model in which a long held http request allows a web server to push data to a browser without the browser explicitly requesting it comet is an umbrella term for multiple techniques for achieving this interaction all these methods rely on features included by default in browsers such as javascript rather than on non default plugins in theory the comet approach differs from the original model of the web in which a browser requests a complete web page or chunks of data to update a web page however in practice comet applications typically use ajax with long polling to detect new information on the server the concept predates the coining of the neologism and is known by several other names including ajax push reverse ajax two way web http streaming and http server push among others

a tree rotation is an operation on a binary search tree that changes the structure without interfering with the order of the elements a tree rotation moves one node up in the tree and one node down they are used to change the shape of the tree and in particular to decrease its height by moving smaller subtrees down and larger subtrees up resulting in improved performance of many tree operations there exists an inconsistency in different descriptions as to the definition of the direction of rotations some say that the direction of a rotation depends on the side which the tree nodes are shifted upon whilst others say that it depends on which child takes the root s place this article takes the approach of the side where the nodes get shifted to 
bottom up parsing is a strategy for analyzing unknown data relationships that attempts to identify the most fundamental units first and then to infer higher order structures from them it attempts to build trees upward toward the start symbol it occurs in the analysis of both natural languages and computer languages 
servlets are java programming language objects that dynamically process requests and construct responses the java servlet api allows a software developer to add dynamic content to a web server using the java platform the generated content is commonly html but may be other data such as xml servlets are the java counterpart to non java dynamic web content technologies such as php cgi and asp net servlets can maintain state across many server transactions by using http cookies session variables or url rewriting the servlet api contained in the java package hierarchy javax servlet defines the expected interactions of a web container and a servlet a web container is essentially the component of a web server that interacts with the servlets the web container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets mapping a url to a particular servlet and ensuring that the url requester has the correct access rights a servlet is an object that receives a request and generates a response based on that request the basic servlet package defines java objects to represent servlet requests and responses as well as objects to reflect the servlet s configuration parameters and execution environment the package javax servlet http defines http specific subclasses of the generic servlet elements including session management objects that track multiple requests and responses between the web server and a client servlets may be packaged in a war file as a web application servlets can be generated automatically by javaserver pages compiler or alternately by template engines such as webmacro often servlets are used in conjunction with jsps in a pattern called model 2 which is a flavor of the model view controller pattern 
java database connectivity is an api for the java programming language that defines how a client may access a database it provides methods for querying and updating data in a database jdbc is oriented towards relational databases the java 2 platform standard edition version 1 4 includes the jdbc 3 0 api together with a reference implementation jdbc to odbc bridge enabling connections to any odbc accessible data source in the jvm host environment this bridge is native code closed source and only appropriate for experimental use and for situations in which no other driver is available not least because it provides only a limited subset of the jdbc 3 0 api as it was originally built and shipped with jdbc 1 0 for use with old odbc v2 0 drivers 
apache struts is an open source web application framework for developing java ee web applications it uses and extends the java servlet api to encourage developers to adopt a model view controller architecture it was originally created by craig mcclanahan and donated to the apache foundation in may 2000 formerly located under the apache jakarta project and known as jakarta struts it became a top level apache project in 2005 struts2 is the rebranding of webwork under the apache struts make 
in computer science a call stack is a dynamic stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program this kind of stack is also known as an execution stack control stack function stack or run time stack and is often shortened to just the stack a call stack is often used for several related purposes but the main reason for having one is to keep track of the point to which each active subroutine should return control when it finishes executing if for example a subroutine drawsquare calls a subroutine drawline from four different places the code of drawline must have a way of knowing where to return this is typically done by code for each call within drawsquare putting the address of the instruction after the particular call statement onto the call stack since the call stack is organized as a stack the caller pushes the return address onto the stack and the called subroutine when it finishes pops the return address off the call stack if a called subroutine calls on to yet another subroutine it will push its return address onto the call stack and so on with the information stacking up and unstacking as the program dictates if the pushing consumes all of the space allocated for the call stack an error called a stack overflow occurs adding a subroutine s entry to the call stack is sometimes called winding conversely removing entries is unwinding there is usually exactly one call stack associated with a running program although additional stacks may be created for signal handling or cooperative multitasking since there is only one in this important context it can be referred to as the stack in high level programming languages the specifics of the call stack are usually hidden from the programmer they are given access only to the list of functions and not the memory on the stack itself most assembly languages on the other hand require programmers to be involved with manipulating the stack the actual details of the stack in a programming language depend upon the compiler operating system and the available instruction set 
inter process communication is a set of techniques for the exchange of data among multiple threads in one or more processes processes may be running on one or more computers connected by a network ipc techniques are divided into methods for message passing synchronization shared memory and remote procedure calls the method of ipc used may vary based on the bandwidth and latency of communication between the threads and the type of data being communicated ipc may also be referred to as inter thread communication and inter application communication ipc on par with the address space concept is the foundation for address space independence isolation 
php is a scripting language originally designed for producing dynamic web pages it has evolved to include a command line interface capability and can be used in standalone graphical applications while php was originally created by rasmus lerdorf in 1995 the main implementation of php is now produced by the php group and serves as the de facto standard for php as there is no formal specification php is free software released under the php license however it is incompatible with the gnu general public license due to restrictions on the usage of the term php php is a widely used general purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into html it generally runs on a web server taking php code as its input and creating web pages as output it can be deployed on most web servers and on almost every operating system and platform free of charge php is installed on more than 20 million websites and 1 million web servers 
relational algebra an offshoot of first order logic deals with a set of relations closed under operators operators operate on one or more relations to yield a relation relational algebra is a part of computer science relation algebra in pure mathematics is an algebraic structure relevant to mathematical logic and set theory 
revision control code management is the management of changes to documents programs and other information stored as computer files it is most commonly used in software development where a team of people may be changing the same files changes are usually identified by a number or letter code termed the revision number revision level or simply revision for example an initial set of files is revision 1 when the first change is made the resulting set is revision 2 and so on each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change revisions can be compared restored and with some types of files merged version control systems are most commonly stand alone applications but revision control is also embedded in various types of software like word processors spreadsheets and in various content management systems integrated revision control is a key feature of wiki software packages such as mediawiki dokuwiki twiki etc in wikis revision control allows for the ability to revert a page to a previous revision which is critical for allowing editors to track each other s edits correct mistakes and defend public wikis against vandalism and spam software tools for revision control are increasingly recognized as being necessary for the organization of multi developer projects 
in computer science a glr parser is an extension of an lr parser algorithm to handle nondeterministic and ambiguous grammars first described in a 1984 paper by masaru tomita it has also been referred to as a parallel parser though the algorithm has evolved since its original form the principles have remained intact tomita s goal was to parse natural language text thoroughly and efficiently standard lr parsers cannot accommodate the nondeterministic and ambiguous nature of natural language and the glr algorithm can 
automata based programming is a programming paradigm in which the program or its part is thought of as a model of a finite state machine or any other formal automata sometimes a potentially infinite set of possible states is introduced and such a set can have a complicated structure not just an enumeration fsm based programming is generally the same but formally speaking doesn t cover all possible variants as fsm stands for finite state machine and automata based programming doesn t necessarily employ fsms in the strict sense the following properties are key indicators for automata based programming the whole execution of the automata based code is a cycle of the automaton s steps another reason to use the notion of automata based programming is that the programmer s style of thinking about the program in this technique is very similar to the style of thinking used to solve maths related tasks using turing machine markov algorithm etc 
product families lines are quite common in our daily lives but before a product family can be successfully established an extensive process has to be followed this process is known as product family engineering product line engineering and software product lines product family line engineering can be defined as a method that creates an underlying architecture of an organizations product platform it provides an architecture that is based on commonality as well as planned variabilities the various product variants can be derived from the basic product family which creates the opportunity to reuse and differentiate on products in the family product family line engineering is a relatively new approach to the creation of new products it focuses on the process of engineering new products in such a way that it is possible to reuse product components and apply variability with decreased costs and time product family line engineering is all about reusing components and structures as much as possible several studies have proven that using a product family line engineering approach for product development can have several benefits 2003 here is a list of some of them the nokia case mentioned below also illustrates these benefits 
domain theory is a branch of mathematics that studies special kinds of partially ordered sets commonly called domains consequently domain theory can be considered as a branch of order theory the field has major applications in computer science where it is used to specify denotational semantics especially for functional programming languages domain theory formalizes the intuitive ideas of approximation and convergence in a very general way and has close relations to topology an alternative important approach to denotational semantics in computer science is that of metric spaces 
a raster image processor is a component used in a printing system which produces a raster image also known as a bitmap the bitmap is then sent to a printing device for output the input may be a page description in a high level page description language such as postscript portable document format xps or another bitmap of higher or lower resolution than the output device in the latter case the rip applies either smoothing or interpolation algorithms to the input bitmap to generate the output bitmap raster image processing is the process and the means of turning vector digital information such as a postscript file into a high resolution raster image originally rips were a rack of electronic hardware which received the page description via some interface and generated a hardware bitmap output which was used to enable or disable each pixel on a real time output device such as an optical film scanner a rip can be implemented either as a software component of an operating system or as a firmware program executed on a microprocessor inside a printer though for high end typesetting standalone hardware rips are sometimes used ghostscript and ghostpcl are examples of software rips every postscript printer contains a rip in its firmware earlier rips retained backward compatibility with photosetters so they supported the older languages so for example linotype rips supported cora 
botnet is a jargon term for a collection of software robots or bots that run autonomously and automatically the term is often associated with malicious software but it can also refer to the network of computers using distributed computing software while the term botnet can be used to refer to any group of bots such as irc bots this word is generally used to refer to a collection of compromised computers running software usually installed via worms trojan horses or backdoors under a common command and control infrastructure a botnet s originator can control the group remotely usually through a means such as irc and usually for nefarious purposes individual programs manifest as irc bots often the command and control takes place via an irc server or a specific channel on a public irc network this server is known as the command and control server though rare more experienced botnet operators program their own commanding protocols from scratch the constituents of these protocols include a server program client program for operation and the program that embeds itself on the victim s machine all three of these usually communicate with each other over a network using a unique encryption scheme for stealth and protection against detection or intrusion into the botnet network a bot typically runs hidden and complies with the rfc 1459 standard generally the perpetrator of the botnet has compromised a series of systems using various tools newer bots can automatically scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords generally the more vulnerabilities a bot can scan and propagate through the more valuable it becomes to a botnet controller community the process of stealing computing resources as a result of a system being joined to a botnet is sometimes referred to as scrumping botnets have become a significant part of the internet albeit increasingly hidden due to most conventional irc networks taking measures and blocking access to previously hosted botnets controllers must now find their own servers often a botnet will include a variety of connections and network types sometimes a controller will hide an irc server installation on an educational or corporate site where high speed connections can support a large number of other bots exploitation of this method of using a bot to host other bots has proliferated only recently as most script kiddies do not have the knowledge to take advantage of it several botnets have been found and removed from the internet the dutch police found a 1 4 million node botnet and the norwegian isp telenor disbanded a 10 000 node botnet large coordinated international efforts to shut down botnets have also been initiated it has been estimated that up to one quarter of all personal computers connected to the internet may be part of a botnet

in logic mathematics and computer science the arity of a function or operation is the number of arguments or operands that the function takes the arity of a relation is the number of domains in the corresponding cartesian product the term springs from such words as unary binary ternary etc the term arity is primarily used with reference to operations if f is the function fÂ  Â snÂ  Â s where s is some set then f is an operation and n is its arity arities greater than 2 are seldom encountered in mathematics except in specialized areas and arities greater than 3 are seldom encountered in theoretical computer science in mathematics depending on the branch arity may be called type adicity or rank in computer science arity may be called adicity a function that takes a variable number of arguments being called variadic in linguistics and in logic arity is sometimes called valency not to be confused with valency in graph theory 
in abstract algebra an isomorphism is a bijective map f such that both f and its inverse fÂ  1 are homomorphisms i e structure preserving mappings in the more general setting of category theory an isomorphism is a morphism f x y in a category for which there exists an inverse fÂ  1 y x with the property that both fÂ  1f idx and ffÂ  1 idy informally an isomorphism is a kind of mapping between objects which shows a relationship between two properties or operations if there exists an isomorphism between two structures we call the two structures isomorphic in a certain sense isomorphic structures are structurally identical if you choose to ignore finer grained differences that may arise from how they are defined

in computer programming an indent style is a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey the program s structure this article largely addresses the c programming language and its descendants but can be applied to most other programming languages indent style is just one aspect of programming style indentation is not a requirement of most programming languages rather programmers indent to better convey the structure of their program to human readers in particular indentation is used to show the relationship between control flow constructs such as conditions or loops and code contained within and outside them however some programming languages use the indentation to determine the structure instead of using braces or keywords the size of the indent is usually independent of the style many early programs used tab characters for indentation for simplicity and to save on source file size unix editors generally view tabs as equivalent to eight characters while macintosh environments would set them to four creating confusion when code was transferred back and forth modern programming editors are now often able to set arbitrary indentation sizes and will insert the appropriate combination of spaces and tabs the topic issue of using hard tabs or spaces is an ongoing debate in the programming community some programmers feel that spaces instead of tabs increase cross platform functionality others believe the opposite that hard tabs increase cross platform functionality there are a number of computer programs that automatically correct indent styles as well as the length of tabs a famous one among them is indent a program included with many unix like operating systems these programs work best for those who use an indent style close to that considered proper by their programmers those who use other styles will more likely become frustrated 
worse is better also called the new jersey style was conceived by richard p gabriel to describe the dynamics of software acceptance but it has broader application the phrase is a play on words representing the concept that quality is relative because of this something can be inferior but still better for example to a particular market or user software that is limited but exceptionally simple to use may be better than software that is more comprehensive but harder to use the phrase is a paradox and at different times gabriel himself has argued both sides of the worse is better concept

in computability theory the ackermann function or ackermann pÃ©ter function is a simple example of a computable function that is not primitive recursive the set of primitive recursive functions is a subset of the set of general recursive functions ackermann s function is an example that shows that the former is a strict subset of the latter the ackermann function is defined recursively for non negative integers m and n as follows its value grows rapidly even for small inputs for example a contains 19 729 decimal digits 
soar is a symbolic cognitive architecture created by john laird allen newell and paul rosenbloom at carnegie mellon university it is both a view of what cognition is and an implementation of that view through a computer programming architecture for artificial intelligence since its beginnings in 1983 and its presentation in a paper in 1987 it has been widely used by ai researchers to model different aspects of human behavior the main goal of the soar project is to be able to handle the full range of capabilities of an intelligent agent from highly routine to extremely difficult open ended problems in order for that to happen according to the view underlying soar it needs to be able to create representations and use appropriate forms of knowledge soar should then address a collection of mechanisms of the mind also underlying the soar architecture is the view that a symbolic system is necessary and sufficient for general intelligence this is known as the physical symbol system hypothesis the views of cognition underlying soar are tied to the psychological theory expressed in allen newell s book unified theories of cognition although the ultimate goal for soar is to achieve general intelligence there is no claim that this goal has already been reached advocates of the system recognize that soar is still missing some important aspects of intelligence currently there are projects underway to add episodic and semantic memories to soar as well as support for emotions some additional examples of missing capabilities include automatically creating new representations on its own such as through hierarchical clustering soar is based on a production system i e it uses explicit production rules to govern its behavior problem solving can be roughly described as a search through a problem space for a goal state this is implemented by searching for the states which bring the system gradually closer to its goal each move consists of a decision cycle which has an elaboration phase and a decision procedure soar originally stood for state operator and result reflecting this representation of problem solving as the application of an operator to a state to get a result according to the project faq the soar development community no longer regards soar as an acronym so it is no longer spelled all in caps though it is still representative of the core of the implementation if the decision procedure just described is not able to determine a unique course of action soar may use different strategies known as weak methods to solve the impasse these methods are appropriate to situations in which knowledge is not abundant some examples are means ends analysis and a type of hill climbing when a solution is found by one of these methods soar uses a learning technique called chunking to transform the course of action taken into a new rule the new rule can then be applied whenever soar encounters the situation again act e g act r is another cognitive architecture by john r anderson that operates on similar principles other cognitive architectures are chrest clarion icarus dual and psi 
a binary clock is a clock which displays traditional sexagesimal time in a binary format originally it showed each decimal digit of sexagesimal time as a binary value but presently true binary clocks also exist most binary clocks are digital although analog varieties exist 
in object oriented design the chain of responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects each processing object contains a set of logic that describes the types of command objects that it can handle and how to pass off those that it cannot to the next processing object in the chain a mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of this chain in a variation of the standard chain of responsibility model some handlers may act as dispatchers capable of sending commands out in a variety of directions forming a tree of responsibility in some cases this can occur recursively with processing objects calling higher up processing objects with commands that attempt to solve some smaller part of the problem in this case recursion continues until the command is processed or the entire tree has been explored an xml interpreter might be a fitting example this pattern promotes the idea of loose coupling which is considered a programming best practice 
literate programming is an approach to programming which was introduced by donald knuth knuth conceived literate programming as an alternative to the structured programming paradigm of the 1970s the literate programming paradigm as conceived by knuth represents a move away from writing programs in the manner and order imposed by the computer and instead enables programmers to develop programs in the order demanded by the logic and flow of their thoughts literate programs are written as an uninterrupted exposition of logic in an ordinary human language much like the text of an essay in which macros which hide abstractions and traditional source code are included literate programming tools are used to both en tangle a literate program into a form suitable for further compilation or execution and to weave the program into formatted documentation while the first generation of literate programming tools were computer language specific the later ones are language agnostic and exist above the programming languages 
the memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state the memento pattern is used by two objects the originator and a caretaker the originator is some object that has an internal state the caretaker is going to do something to the originator but wants to be able to undo the change the caretaker first asks the originator for a memento object then it does whatever operation it was going to do to roll back to the state before the operations it returns the memento object to the originator the memento object itself is an opaque object when using this pattern care should be taken if the originator may change other objects or resources the memento pattern operates on a single object classic examples of the memento pattern include the seed of a pseudorandom number generator and the state in a finite state machine 
byzantine fault tolerance is a sub field of error tolerance research inspired by the byzantine generals problem which is a generalized version of the two generals problem the object of byzantine fault tolerance is to be able to defend against a byzantine failure in which a component of some system not only behaves erroneously but also fails to behave consistently when interacting with multiple other components correctly functioning components of a byzantine fault tolerant system will be able to reach the same group decisions assuming there are not too many byzantine faulty components 
the windows api informally winapi is microsoft s core set of application programming interfaces available in the microsoft windows operating systems it was formerly called the win32 api however the name windows api more accurately reflects its roots in 16 bit windows and its support on 64 bit windows almost all windows programs interact with the windows api a small number use the native api the microsoft windows sdk is available for windows which provides documentation and tools to enable developers to create software using the windows api and associated windows technologies 
in software engineering a web application or webapp is an application that is accessed via web browser over a network such as the internet or an intranet it is also a computer software application that is coded in a browser supported language and reliant on a common web browser to render the application executable web applications are popular due to the ubiquity of web browsers and the convenience of using a web browser as a client sometimes called a thin client the ability to update and maintain web applications without distributing and installing software on potentially thousands of client computers is a key reason for their popularity common web applications include webmail online retail sales online auctions wikis and many other functions

in the mathematical discipline known as order theory a hasse diagram is a simple picture of a finite partially ordered set forming a drawing of the transitive reduction of the partial order concretely for a partially ordered set one represents each element of s as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from x to y if x y and there is no z such that x z y for all x in this case we say y covers x or y is an immediate successor of x furthermore it is required that the vertices are positioned in such a way that each curve meets exactly two vertices its two endpoints any such diagram uniquely determines a partial order and any finite partial order has a unique transitive reduction but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane resulting in different hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances hasse diagrams are named after helmut hasse according to birkhoff they are so called because of the effective use hasse made of them however hasse was not the first to use these diagrams they appear e g in vogt although hasse diagrams were originally devised as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand they have more recently been created automatically using graph drawing techniques sometimes the phrase hasse diagram is used to refer to the transitive reduction as an abstract directed acyclic graph independently of any drawing of that graph but this usage is eschewed here 
in electrical engineering and computer science image processing is any form of signal processing for which the input is an image such as photographs or frames of video the output of image processing can be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image most image processing techniques involve treating the image as a two dimensional signal and applying standard signal processing techniques to it image processing usually refers to digital image processing but optical and analog image processing are also possible this article is about general techniques that apply to all of them 
this article itemizes the various lists of mathematics topics some of these lists link to hundreds of articles some link only to a few the extremely long list of mathematics articles contains all mathematical articles in alphabetical order this article brings together the same content organised in a manner better suited to browsing the purpose of this list is not similar to that of the mathematics subject classification formulated by the american mathematical society many mathematics journals ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the mathematics subject classification in their papers the subject codes so listed are used by the two major reviewing databases mathematical reviews and zentralblatt math this list has some items that would not fit in such a classification such as list of exponential topics and list of factorial and binomial topics which may surprise the reader with the diversity of their coverage

bittorrent is a peer to peer file sharing protocol used for distributing large amounts of data bittorrent is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files and by some estimates it accounts for about 35 of all traffic on the entire internet the protocol works initially when a file provider makes his file available to the network this is called a seed and allows others named peers to connect and download the file each peer who downloads a part of the data makes it available to other peers to download after the file is successfully downloaded by a peer many continue to make the data available becoming additional seeds this distributed nature of bittorrent leads to a viral spreading of a file throughout peers as more seeds get added the likelihood of a successful connection increases exponentially relative to standard internet hosting this provides a significant reduction in the original distributor s hardware and bandwidth resource costs it also provides redundancy against system problems and reduces dependence on the original distributor programmer bram cohen designed the protocol in april 2001 and released a first implementation on july 2 2001 it is now maintained by cohen s company bittorrent inc there are numerous bittorrent clients available for a variety of computing platforms according to isohunt the total amount of shared content is currently more than 1 1 petabytes 
the von neumann architecture is a design model for a stored program digital computer that uses a processing unit and a single separate storage structure to hold both instructions and data it is named after the mathematician and early computer scientist john von neumann such computers implement a universal turing machine and have a sequential architecture a stored program digital computer is one that keeps its programmed instructions as well as its data in read write random access memory stored program computers were an advancement over the program controlled computers of the 1940s such as the colossus and the eniac which were programmed by setting switches and inserting patch leads to route data and to control signals between various functional units in the vast majority of modern computers the same memory is used for both data and program instructions the terms von neumann architecture and stored program computer are generally used interchangeably and that usage is followed in this article in contrast the harvard architecture stores a program in a modifiable form but without using the same physical storage or format for general data 
plain old documentation abbreviated pod is a simple markup language used to document the perl programming language 
big design up front is a term for any software development approach in which the program s design is to be completed and perfected before that program s implementation is started it is often associated with the waterfall model of software development the argument between the proponents and critics of bduf has somewhat degenerated into a holy war with most people believing that a compromise between bduf and the more extreme variants of agile software development is the best solution to most software development problems 
io is a pure object oriented programming language inspired by smalltalk self lua lisp act1 and newtonscript io has a prototype based object model similar to the ones in self and newtonscript eliminating the distinction between instance and class like smalltalk everything is an object and it uses dynamic typing like lisp programs are just data trees io uses actors for concurrency a technique rarely used in modern programming languages remarkable features of io are its minimal size and openness to using external code resources io is executed by a small portable virtual machine 
not invented here is a term used to describe persistent social corporate or institutional culture that avoids using or buying already existing products research or knowledge because of its different origins it is normally used in a pejorative sense as a social phenomenon not invented here syndrome is manifested as an unwillingness to adopt an idea or product because it originates from another culture a form of nationalism 
the year 2038 problem may cause some computer software to fail before or in the year 2038 the problem affects all software and systems that store system time as a signed 32 bit integer and interpret this number as the number of seconds since 00 00 00Â januaryÂ 1 Â 1970 the latest time that can be represented this way is 03 14 07 utc on tuesday 19 january 2038 times beyond this moment will wrap around and be stored internally as a negative number which these systems will interpret as a date in 1901 rather than 2038 this will likely cause problems for users of these systems due to erroneous calculations further while most programs will only be affected in or very close to 2038 programs that work with future dates will begin to run into problems much sooner for example a program that works with dates 20 years in the future will have to be fixed no later than in 2018 because most 32 bit unix like systems store and manipulate time in this format it is usually called unix time and so the year 2038 problem is often referred to as the unix millennium bug however any other non unix operating systems and software that store and manipulate time this way will be just as vulnerable 

beamer is a latex class for creating slides for presentations it works together with pdflatex dvips and lyx the name is taken from the german word beamer a pseudo anglicism for video projector the beamer class is not the first latex class for creating presentations and like many of its predecessors it has special syntax for defining slides slides can be built up on screen in stages as if by revealing text that was previously hidden or covered this is handled with pdf output by creating successive pages that preserve the layout but add new elements so that advancing to the next page in the pdf file appears to add something to the displayed page when in fact it has redrawn the page beamer provides the ability to make handouts that is a version of the output suitable for printing without the dynamic features so that the printed version of a slide shows the final version that will appear during the presentation an article version is also available rendered on standard sized paper with frame titles used as paragraph titles no special slide layout colors keeping the sectioning this version is suitable for lecture notes or for having a single source file for an article and the slides for the talk about this article beamer relies on pgf for some of its features 
a shell script is a script written for the shell or command line interpreter of an operating system it is often considered a simple domain specific programming language typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation program execution and printing text many shell script interpreters double as command line interface such as the various unix shells windows powershell or the ms dos command com others such as applescript or the graphical windows script host add scripting capability to computing environments without requiring a command line interface other examples of programming languages primarily intended for shell scripting include dcl and jcl 
han unification is an effort by the authors of unicode and the universal character set to map multiple character sets of the so called cjk languages into a single set of unified characters han characters are a common feature of written chinese japanese korean and cantonese in hong kong and at least historically other east and southeast asian languages modern chinese korean and japanese typefaces typically use regional or historical variants of a given han character in the formulation of unicode an attempt was made to unify these variants by considering them different glyphs representing the same grapheme or orthographic unit hence han unification with the resulting character repertoire sometimes contracted to unihan unihan can also refer to the unihan database maintained by the unicode consortium which provides information about all of the unified han characters encoded in the unicode standard including mappings to various national and industry standards indices into standard dictionaries encoded variants pronunciations in various languages and an english definition the database is available to the public as a text file and via an interactive web site the latter also includes representative glyphs and definitions for compound words drawn from the free japanese edict and chinese cedict dictionary projects 
 integration testing is the activity of software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group it sits between unit testing and system testing integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested groups them in larger aggregates applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing 
in computer science imperative programming is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state in much the same way that imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands to take action imperative programs define sequences of commands for the computer to perform the term is used in opposition to declarative programming which expresses what needs to be done without prescribing how to do it in terms of sequences of actions to be taken functional and logical programming are examples of a more declarative approach

in computing streaming simd extensions is a simd instruction set extension to the x86 architecture designed by intel and introduced in 1999 in their pentium iii series processors as a reply to amd s 3dnow sse contains 70 new instructions it was originally known as kni for katmai new instructions during the katmai project intel was looking to distinguish it from their earlier product line particularly their flagship pentium ii it was later renamed isse for internet streaming simd extensions then sse amd eventually added support for sse instructions starting with its athlon xp processor intel was generally disappointed with their first ia 32 simd effort mmx mmx had two main problems it re used existing floating point registers making the cpu unable to work on both floating point and simd data at the same time and it only worked on integers 
symbian os is a proprietary operating system designed for mobile devices with associated libraries user interface frameworks and reference implementations of common tools developed by symbian ltd it is a descendant of psion s epoc and runs exclusively on arm processors although a non productized x86 port exists on 24 june 1998 symbian ltd was formed as a partnership between ericsson nokia motorola and psion to exploit the convergence between pdas and mobile phones symbian was previously owned by nokia ericsson sony ericsson panasonic and samsung ten years later to the day on 24 june 2008 nokia announced that they intended to acquire all shares that they did not already own the acquisition was of 264 million or 410 million on 24 june 2008 the symbian foundation was announced with the aim to provide royalty free software and accelerate innovation 
a computer simulation a computer model or a computational model is a computer program or network of computers that attempts to simulate an abstract model of a particular system computer simulations have become a useful part of mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics chemistry and biology human systems in economics psychology and social science and in the process of engineering new technology to gain insight into the operation of those systems or to observe their behavior computer simulations vary from computer programs that run a few minutes to network based groups of computers running for hours to ongoing simulations that run for days the scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible using the traditional paper and pencil mathematical modeling over 10 years ago a desert battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66 239 tanks trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around kuwait using multiple supercomputers in the dod high performance computer modernization program a 1 billion atom model of material deformation a 2 64 million atom model of the complex maker of protein in all organisms a ribosome in 2005 and the blue brain project at epfl began in may 2005 to create the first computer simulation of the entire human brain right down to the molecular level 
the law of demeter or principle of least knowledge is a design guideline for developing software particularly object oriented programs the guideline was invented at northeastern university towards the end of 1987 and can be succinctly summarized as only talk to your immediate friends the fundamental notion is that a given object should assume as little as possible about the structure or properties of anything else it is so named for its origin in the demeter project an adaptive programming and aspect oriented programming effort this project was named in honor of demeter distribution mother and goddess of agriculture to signify a bottom up philosophy of programming which is also embodied in the law itself note that it is debatable if bottom up is the correct analogy it can be argued that software evolves or grows which is appropriate given demeter s mythological role when applied to object oriented programs the law of demeter can be more precisely called the law of demeter for functions methods in this case an object a can request a service of an object instance b but object a cannot reach through object b to access yet another object c to request its services doing so would mean that object a implicitly requires greater knowledge of object b s internal structure instead b s class should be modified if necessary so that object a can simply make the request directly of object b and then let object b propagate the request to any relevant subcomponents or a should have a direct reference to object c and make the call directly if the law is followed only object b knows its own internal structure more formally the law of demeter for functions requires that a method m of an object o may only invoke the methods of the following kinds of objects in particular an object should avoid invoking methods of a member object returned by another method for many modern object oriented languages that use a dot as field identifier the law can be stated simply as use only one dot that is the code a b method breaks the law where a method does not there is disagreement as to the sufficiency of this approach as a simple example when one wants to walk a dog it would be folly to command the dog s legs to walk directly instead one commands the dog and lets it take care of its legs itself the advantage of following the law of demeter is that the resulting software tends to be more maintainable and adaptable since objects are less dependent on the internal structure of other objects object containers can be changed without reworking their callers a disadvantage of the law of demeter is that it sometimes requires writing a large number of small wrapper methods to propagate method calls to the components furthermore a class s interface can become bulky as it hosts methods for contained classes resulting in a class without a cohesive interface basili et al published experimental results in 1996 suggesting that the law of demeter was a valid way to reduce the probability of software faults 
a sequence diagram in unified modelling language is a kind of interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order it is a construct of a message sequence chart sequence diagrams are sometimes called event trace diagrams event scenarios and timing diagrams 
a deadlock is a situation wherein two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish and thus neither ever does it is often seen in a paradox like the chicken or the egg in computer science deadlock refers to a specific condition when two or more processes are each waiting for each other to release a resource or more than two processes are waiting for resources in a circular chain deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing where many processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a software or soft lock computers intended for the time sharing and or real time markets are often equipped with a hardware lock which guarantees exclusive access to processes forcing serialization deadlocks are particularly troubling because there is no general solution to avoid deadlocks this situation may be likened to two people who are drawing diagrams with only one pencil and one ruler between them if one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler a deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs the pencil to finish his work with the ruler both requests can t be satisfied so a deadlock occurs the telecommunications description of deadlock is a little stronger deadlock occurs when none of the processes meet the condition to move to another state and all the communication channels are empty the second condition is often left out on other systems but is important in the telecommunication context

data mining is the process of extracting hidden patterns from large amounts of data as more data is gathered with the amount of data doubling every three years data mining is becoming an increasingly important tool to transform this data into information it is commonly used in a wide range of profiling practices such as marketing surveillance fraud detection and scientific discovery while data mining can be used to uncover hidden patterns in data samples that have been mined it is important to be aware that the use of a sample of the data may produce results that are not indicative of the domain data mining will not uncover patterns that are present in the domain but not in the sample there is a tendency for insufficiently knowledgable consumers of the results to treat the technique as a sort of crystal ball and attribute magical thinking to it like any other tool it only functions in conjunction with the appropriate raw material in this case indicative and representative data that the user must first collect further the discovery of a particular pattern in a particular set of data does not necessarily mean that pattern is representative of the whole population from which that data was drawn hence an important part of the process is the verification and validation of patterns on other samples of data the term data mining has also been used in a related but negative sense to mean the deliberate searching for apparent but not necessarily representative patterns in large amounts of data to avoid confusion with the other sense the terms data dredging and data snooping are often used note however that dredging and snooping can be used as exploratory tools when developing and clarifying hypotheses

in computer science non blocking synchronization ensures that threads competing for a shared resource do not have their execution indefinitely postponed by mutual exclusion a non blocking algorithm is lock free if there is guaranteed system wide progress wait free if there is also guaranteed per thread progress literature up to the turn of the century used non blocking synonymously with lock free however since 2003 the term has been weakened to only prevent progress blocking interactions with a preemptive scheduler in modern usage therefore an algorithm is non blocking if the suspension of one or more threads will not stop the potential progress of the remaining threads they are designed to avoid requiring a critical section often these algorithms allow multiple processes to make progress on a problem without ever blocking each other for some operations these algorithms provide an alternative to locking mechanisms

a prototype pattern is a creational design pattern used in software development when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance which is cloned to produce new objects this pattern is used to to implement the pattern declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual clone method any class that needs a polymorphic constructor capability derives itself from the abstract base class and implements the clone operation the client instead of writing code that invokes the new operator on a hard wired class name calls the clone method on the prototype calls a factory method with a parameter designating the particular concrete derived class desired or invokes the clone method through some mechanism provided by another design pattern 
in computing a shebang refers to the characters when they are the first two characters in a text file unix like operating systems take the presence of these two characters as an indication that the file is a script and try to execute that script using the interpreter specified by the rest of the first line in the file for instance shell scripts for the bourne shell start with the first line more precisely a shebang line consists of a number sign and an exclamation point character followed by the path to the interpreter program that will provide the interpretation the shebang is looked for and used when a script is invoked directly and largely to the end of making scripts look and act similarly to regular executables to the operating system and to the user because the  character is often used as the comment marker in scripting languages the contents of the shebang line will be automatically ignored by the interpreter itself the shebang line only exists to specify to the operating system the correct interpreter to use 
the viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states called the viterbi path that results in a sequence of observed events especially in the context of markov information sources and more generally hidden markov models the forward algorithm is a closely related algorithm for computing the probability of a sequence of observed events these algorithms belong to the realm of information theory the algorithm makes a number of assumptions first both the observed events and hidden events must be in a sequence this sequence often corresponds to time second these two sequences need to be aligned and an instance of an observed event needs to correspond to exactly one instance of a hidden event third computing the most likely hidden sequence up to a certain point t must depend only on the observed event at point t and the most likely sequence at point t 1 these assumptions are all satisfied in a first order hidden markov model the terms viterbi path and viterbi algorithm are also applied to related dynamic programming algorithms that discover the single most likely explanation for an observation for example in statistical parsing a dynamic programming algorithm can be used to discover the single most likely context free derivation of a string which is sometimes called the viterbi parse the viterbi algorithm was conceived by andrew viterbi in 1967 as an error correction scheme for noisy digital communication links finding universal application in decoding the convolutional codes used in both cdma and gsm digital cellular dial up modems satellite deep space communications and 802 11 wireless lans it is now also commonly used in speech recognition keyword spotting computational linguistics and bioinformatics for example in speech to text the acoustic signal is treated as the observed sequence of events and a string of text is considered to be the hidden cause of the acoustic signal the viterbi algorithm finds the most likely string of text given the acoustic signal 
the jaccard index also known as the jaccard similarity coefficient is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets the jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample sets and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets the jaccard distance which measures dissimilarity between sample sets is complementary to the jaccard coefficient and is obtained by subtracting the jaccard coefficient from 1 or equivalently by dividing the difference of the sizes of the union and the intersection of two sets by the size of the union 
the binary gcd algorithm is an algorithm which computes the greatest common divisor of two nonnegative integers it gains a measure of efficiency over the ancient euclidean algorithm by replacing divisions and multiplications with shifts which are cheaper when operating on the binary representation used by modern computers this is particularly critical on embedded platforms that have no direct processor support for division while the algorithm was first published by the german josef stein in 1967 it may have been known in first century china

in mathematics bicubic interpolation is an extension of cubic interpolation for interpolating data points on a two dimensional regular grid the interpolated surface is smoother than corresponding surfaces obtained by bilinear interpolation or nearest neighbor interpolation bicubic interpolation can be accomplished using either lagrange polynomials cubic splines or cubic convolution algorithm in image processing bicubic interpolation is often chosen over bilinear interpolation or nearest neighbor in image resampling when speed is not an issue images resampled with bicubic interpolation are smoother and have fewer interpolation artifacts 
the z machine is a virtual machine that was developed by joel berez and marc blank in 1979 and used by infocom for its text adventure games infocom compiled game code to files containing z machine instructions and could therefore port all its text adventures to a new platform simply by writing a z machine implementation for that platform with the large number of incompatible home computer systems in use at the time this was an important advantage over using native code the z of z machine stands for zork infocom s first adventure game z code files usually have names ending in z1 z2 z3 z4 z5 z6 z7 or z8 where the number is the version number of the z machine on which the file is intended to be run as given by the first byte of the story file this is a modern convention however infocom itself used extensions of dat and zip but the latter clashes with the present widespread use of zip for pkzip compatible archive files infocom produced six versions of the z machine files using versions 1 and 2 are very rare only two version 1 files are known to have been released by infocom and only two of version 2 version 3 covers the vast majority of infocom s released games the later versions had more capabilities culminating in some graphic support in version 6 the compiler which infocom used to produce its story files has never been released although documentation of the language used still exists but in may 1993 graham nelson released the first version of his inform compiler which also generates z machine story files as its output even though the inform source language is quite different from zil most files produced by inform are version 5 inform has since become very popular in the interactive fiction community and as a consequence a large proportion of the interactive fiction now produced is in the form of z machine story files demand for the ability to create larger game files led graham nelson to specify versions 7 and 8 of the z machine though version 7 is very rarely used because of the way addresses are handled a version 3 story file can be up to 128k in length a version 5 story can be up to 256k in length and a version 8 story can be up to 512k in length though these sizes may seem small by today s computing standards for text only adventures these are large enough for very elaborate games during the 1990s graham nelson drew up a z machine standard based on detailed studies of the existing infocom files

stemming is the process for reducing inflected words to their stem base or root form generally a written word form the stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem even if this stem is not in itself a valid root the algorithm has been a long standing problem in computer science the first paper on the subject was published in 1968 the process of stemming often called conflation is useful in search engines for query expansion or indexing and other natural language processing problems stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers 
open source is an approach to design development and distribution offering practical accessibility to a product s source some consider open source as one of various possible design approaches while others consider it a critical strategic element of their operations before open source became widely adopted developers and producers used a variety of phrases to describe the concept the term open source gained popularity with the rise of the internet which provided access to diverse production models communication paths and interactive communities the open source model of operation and decision making allows concurrent input of different agendas approaches and priorities and differs from the more closed centralized models of development the principles and practices are commonly applied to the peer production development of source code for software that is made available for public collaboration the result of this peer based collaboration is usually released as open source software however open source methods are increasingly being applied in other fields of endeavor such as biotechnology

in computer science the scientific community metaphor is a metaphor used to aid understanding scientific communities the first publications on the scientific community metaphor in 1981 and 1982 involved the development of a programming language named ether that invoked procedural plans to process goals and assertions concurrently by dynamically creating new rules during program execution ether also addressed issues of conflict and contradiction with multiple sources of knowledge and multiple viewpoints 
network topology is the study of the arrangement or mapping of the elements of a network especially the physical and logical interconnections between nodes a local area network is one example of a network that exhibits both a physical topology and a logical topology any given node in the lan will have one or more links to one or more other nodes in the network and the mapping of these links and nodes onto a graph results in a geometrical shape that determines the physical topology of the network likewise the mapping of the flow of data between the nodes in the network determines the logical topology of the network the physical and logical topologies might be identical in any particular network but they also may be different any particular network topology is determined only by the graphical mapping of the configuration of physical and or logical connections between nodes lan network topology is therefore technically a part of graph theory distances between nodes physical interconnections transmission rates and or signal types may differ in two networks and yet their topologies may be identical 
pygame is a cross platform set of python modules designed for writing video games it includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the python programming language it is built over the simple directmedia layer library with the intention of allowing real time computer game development without the restraints and low level mechanics of the c programming language and its derivatives this is based on the assumption that the most consuming functions inside games can be completely abstracted from the game logic in itself making it possible to use a high level programming language like python to structure the game pygame was built to replace pysdl after its sudden death pygame was originally written by pete shinners and is released under the gnu lesser general public license it is now an open source free software community project 
a van emde boas tree also known as a veb tree is a tree data structure which implements an associative array with m bit integer keys it performs all operations in o time notice that m is the size of the keys therefore o is o in a full tree exponentially better than a self balancing binary search tree they also have good space efficiency when they contain a large number of elements as discussed below they were invented by a team led by peter van emde boas in 1977 
screen scraping is a technique in which a computer program extracts data from the display output of another program the program doing the scraping is called a screen scraper the key element that distinguishes screen scraping from regular parsing is that the output being scraped was intended for display to an end user rather than as input to another program and is therefore usually neither documented nor structured for convenient parsing screen scraping often involves ignoring binary data and formatting elements that obscure the essential desired text data optical character recognition software is a kind of visual scraper 
cloud computing is a style of computing in which dynamically scalable and often virtualised resources are provided as a service over the internet users need not have knowledge of expertise in or control over the technology infrastructure in the cloud that supports themthe concept incorporates infrastructure as a service platform as a service and software as a service as well as web 2 0 and other recent technology trends that have the common theme of reliance on the internet for satisfying the computing needs of the users examples of saas vendors include salesforce com and google apps which provide common business applications online that are accessed from a web browser while the software and data are stored on the servers the term cloud is used as a metaphor for the internet based on how the internet is depicted in computer network diagrams and is an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it conceals

null is a special marker used in structured query language to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database introduced by the creator of the relational database model e f codd sql null serves to fulfill the requirement that all true relational database management systems support a representation of missing information and inapplicable information codd also introduced the use of the lowercase greek omega symbol to represent null in database theory null is also an sql reserved keyword used to identify the null special marker null has been the focus of controversy and a source of debate because of its associated three valued logic special requirements for its use in sql joins and the special handling required by aggregate functions and sql grouping operators although special functions and predicates are provided to properly handle nulls opponents feel that resolving these issues introduces unnecessary complexity and inconsistency into the relational model of databases 
in mathematical logic in particular as applied to computer science a unification of two terms is a join with respect to a specialisation order that is we suppose a preorder on a set of terms for which t t means that t is obtained from t by substituting some term for one or more free variables in t the unification u of s and t if it exists is a term that is a substitution instance of both s and t if any common substitution instance of s and t is also an instance of u u is called minimal unification for example with polynomials x 2 and y 3 can be unified to z6 by taking x z3 and y z2 
xbl is an xml based markup language used to declare the behavior and look of xul widgets and xml elements xbl was developed by the mozilla project for use in the mozilla application suite the language is not currently described by any formal standard and is thus proprietary to mozilla with the only implementation being the gecko layout engine xbl 2 0 is the new version of xbl which is in process of being standardized by the world wide web consortium 
quickcheck is a combinator library written in haskell designed to assist in software testing by generating test cases for test suites it is compatible with the ghc compiler and the hugs interpreter the author of the program being tested makes certain assertions about logical properties that a function should fulfill these tests are specifically generated to test and attempt to falsify these assertions the project was started in 2000 besides being used to test regular programs quickcheck is also useful for building up a functional specification for documenting what functions should be doing and for testing compiler implementations re implementations of quickcheck exist for erlang scheme common lisp perl python ruby java scala f and standard ml

in information theory a low density parity check code is an error correcting code a method of transmitting a message over a noisy transmission channel while ldpc and other error correcting codes cannot guarantee perfect transmission the probability of lost information can be made as small as desired ldpc was the first code to allow data transmission rates close to the theoretical maximum the shannon limit impractical to implement when developed in 1963 ldpc codes were forgotten but in 1996 they were rediscovered turbo codes discovered in 1993 became the coding scheme of choice in the late 1990s used for applications such as deep space satellite communications however in the last few years the advances in low density parity check codes have developed them past turbo codes and ldpc is the most efficient scheme discovered as of 2009 ldpc is finding use in practical applications such as 10gbase t ethernet which sends data at 10 gigabits per second over noisy cat6 cables the explosive growth in information technology has produced a corresponding increase of commercial interest in the development of highly efficient data transmission codes as such codes impact everything from signal quality to battery life although implementation of ldpc codes has lagged that of other codes notably the turbo code the absence of encumbering software patents has made ldpc attractive to some and ldpc codes are positioned to become a standard in the developing market for highly efficient data transmission methods in 2003 an ldpc code beat six turbo codes to become the error correcting code in the new dvb s2 standard for the satellite transmission of digital television in 2008 ldpc beat convolutional turbo codes as the fec scheme for the itu t g hn standard g hn chose ldpc over turbo codes because of its lower decoding complexity and because the proposed turbo codes exhibited a significant error floor at the desired range of operation ldpc codes are also known as gallager codes in honor of robert g gallager who developed the ldpc concept in his doctoral dissertation at mit in 1960 
the j programming language developed in the early 1990s by ken iverson and roger hui is a synthesis of apl and the fp and fl function level languages created by john backus to avoid repeating the apl special character problem j requires only the basic ascii character set resorting to the use of digraphs formed using the dot or colon characters to extend the meaning of the basic characters available additionally to keep parsing and the language simple and to extend the otherwise small number of suitable symbols in ascii j treats many characters which normally appear in pairs such as   or  not as individual stand alone tokens but as digraphs j treats them as multi character tokens being an array programming language j is very terse and powerful and is most suited to mathematical and statistical programming especially when performing operations on matrices j is a mimd language like the original fp fl languages j supports function level programming via its tacit programming features unlike most languages that support object oriented programming j s flexible hierarchical namespace scheme can be effectively used as a framework for both class based and prototype based object oriented programming j is not a von neumann programming language however it is possible to use the von neumann programming style

class responsibility collaborator are a brainstorming tool used in the design of object oriented software they were proposed by ward cunningham and kent beck they are typically used when first determining which classes are needed and how they will interact crc cards are usually created from index cards on which are written using a small card keeps the complexity of the design at a minimum it focuses the designer on the essentials of the class and prevents him from getting into its details and inner workings at a time when such detail is probably counter productive it also forces the designer to refrain from giving the class too many responsibilities because the cards are portable they can easily be laid out on a table and re arranged while discussing a design with other people a common method to determine what cards should be created is to read a specification for the program being designed and consider if each noun should be a class and if each verb should be a responsibility of the noun or class to which it belongs naturally the existence of a noun or verb does not require a class or responsibility in the program but it is considered a good starting point 
the following is a list of microsoft apis and frameworks 
in computer science a calling convention is a scheme for how functions receive parameters from their caller and how they return a result calling conventions can differ in different programming languages use different calling conventions and so can different platforms this can sometimes cause problems when combining modules written in multiple languages or when calling operating system or library apis from a language other than the one in which they are written in these cases special care must be taken to coordinate the calling conventions used by caller and callee even a program using a single programming language may use multiple calling conventions either chosen by the compiler for code optimization or specified by the programmer architectures almost always have more than one possible calling convention with many general purpose registers and other features the potential number of calling conventions is large although some architectures are specified to use only one calling convention supplied by the architect 
software art refers to works of art where the creation of software or concepts from software play an important role for example software applications which were created by artists and which were intended as artworks although video games are also software art the term is often used to single out works that are non interactive or don t fit the usual definition of a game software art as an artistic discipline has attained growing attention since the late 1990s it is closely related to internet art since it often relies on the internet most notably the world wide web for dissemination and critical discussion of the works browser art is an important subset of software art since 2000 software art has become a genre worthy of critical speculation and merit art festivals such as file electronic language international festival transmediale prix ars electronica and readme have devoted considerable attention to the medium and through this have helped to bring software art to a wider audience of theorists and academics 
in computer programming green threads are threads that are scheduled by a virtual machine instead of natively by the underlying operating system green threads emulate multithreaded environments without relying on any native os capabilities green threads are managed in user space instead of kernel space enabling them to work in environments that do not have native thread support 
patch is a unix program that updates text files according to instructions contained in a separate file called a patch file the patch file is a text file that consists of a list of differences and is produced by running the related diff program with the original and updated file as arguments updating files with patch is often referred to as applying the patch or simply patching the files 
bayesian spam filtering after rev thomas bayes a form of e mail filtering is the process of using a naive bayesian classifier to identify spam e mail it is one of the techniques of statistical e mail filtering the first known mail filtering program to use a bayes classifier was jason rennie s ifile program released in 1996 the program was used to sort mail into folders the first scholarly publication on bayesian spam filtering was by sahami et al variants of the basic technique have been implemented in a number of research works and commercial software products in 2002 the principles of bayesian filtering were publicized to more general audiences in an essay by paul graham bayesian spam filtering has become a popular mechanism to distinguish illegitimate spam email from legitimate email many modern mail clients implement bayesian spam filtering users can also install separate email filtering programs server side email filters such as dspam spamassassin spambayes bogofilter and assp make use of bayesian spam filtering techniques and the functionality is sometimes embedded within mail server software itself 
packing problems are one area where mathematics meets puzzles many of these problems stem from real life problems with packing items in a packing problem you are given usually the packing must be without gaps or overlaps but in some packing problems the overlapping is allowed but should be minimised in others gaps are allowed but overlaps are not 
message oriented middleware is a client server infrastructure that increases the interoperability portability and flexibility of an application by allowing the application to be distributed over multiple heterogeneous platforms it reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple operating systems and network protocols by insulating the application developer from the details of the various operating system and network interfaces apis that extend across diverse platforms and networks are typically provided by the mom mom is software that resides in both portions of client server architecture and typically supports asynchronous calls between the client and server applications message queues provide temporary storage when the destination program is busy or not connected mom reduces the involvement of application developers with the complexity of the master slave nature of the client server mechanism mom comprises a category of inter application communication software that generally relies on asynchronous message passing as opposed to a request response metaphor most message oriented middleware depend on a message queue system but there are some implementations that rely on broadcast or multicast messaging systems 
gnu automake is a programming tool that produces portable makefiles for use by the make program used in compiling software it is made by the free software foundation as one of gnu programs and is part of the gnu build system the makefiles produced follow the gnu coding standards it is written in the perl programming language and must be used with gnu autoconf automake contains the following commands aclocal however is a general purpose program that can be useful to autoconf users the gnu compiler collection for example uses aclocal even though its makefile is hand written like autoconf automake can be quite hard to deal with because it is not entirely backwards compatible for example a project created with automake 1 4 will not necessarily work with automake 1 9 
a foreign function interface is a mechanism by which a program written in one programming language can call routines or make use of services written in another the term comes from the specification for common lisp which explicitly refers to the language features for inter language calls as such the term is also used officially by the haskell programming language other languages use other terminology foreign function interface has become generic terminology for mechanisms which provide such services it should be noted that despite the name ffis are not necessarily restricted to function calls many ffis permit method calls on objects and some even permit migration of non trivial datatypes and or objects across the language boundary the term foreign function interface is generally not used to describe multi lingual runtimes such as the microsoft common language runtime where a common substrate is provided which enables any clr compliant language to use services defined in any other in addition many distributed computing architectures such as the java remote method invocation rpc corba soap and d bus permit different services to be written in different languages such architectures are generally not considered ffis in most cases a ffi is defined by a higher level language so that it may employ services defined and implemented in a lower level language typically a systems language like c or c this is typically done to either access os services in the language in which the os api is defined or for performance considerations many ffis also provide the means for the called language to invoke services in the host language as well 
robert c pike is a software engineer and author he is best known for his work at bell labs where he was a member of the unix team and was involved in the creation of the plan 9 from bell labs and inferno operating systems as well as the limbo programming language he also co developed the blit graphical terminal for unix before that he wrote the first window system for unix in 1981 pike was the applicant for at t patent number 4555775 or backing store patent that is part of the x graphic system protocol pike is a prominent proponent of software patents over the years pike has written many text editors sam and acme are the most well known and are still in active use and development pike with brian kernighan is the co author of the practice of programming and the unix programming environment with ken thompson he is the co creator of utf 8 pike also developed lesser systems such as the vismon program for displaying images of faces of email authors pike also appeared once on the late show with david letterman as a technical assistant to the comedy duo penn and teller as a joke pike claimed to have won the 1980 olympic silver medal in archery however canada boycotted the 1980 summer olympics pike a canadian citizen is married to renÃ©e french and currently works for google 
the anxiety of influence a theory of poetry is a book by harold bloom published in 1973 it was the first in a series of books that advanced a new revisionary or antithetical approach to literary criticism bloom s central thesis is that poets are hindered in their creative process by the ambiguous relationship they necessarily maintained with precursor poets while admitting the influence of extraliterary experience on every poet he argues that the poet in a poet is inspired to write by reading another poet s poetry and will tend to produce work that is derivative of existing poetry and therefore weak because a poet must forge an original poetic vision in order to guarantee his survival into posterity the influence of precursor poets inspires a sense of anxiety in living poets thus bloom attempts to work out the process by which the small minority of strong poets manage to create original work in spite of the pressure of influence such an agon he asserts depends on six revisionary ratios which reflect freudian defense mechanisms and the tropes of classical rhetoric later books especially kabbalah and criticism and a map of misreading connect each ratio to the kabbalah prior to writing this book bloom spent a decade studying the romantic poets of the early nineteenth century this is reflected in the emphasis given to those poets and their struggle with the influence of john milton other poets analyzed range from lucretius and dante to walt whitman wallace stevens and john ashbery in the anxiety of influence and other early books bloom claimed that influence was particularly important for post enlightenment poets conversely he suggested that influence was not as much of a problem for such poets as shakespeare and ben jonson he since has changed his mind and the most recent editions of the anxiety of influence include a preface claiming that shakespeare was troubled early in his career by the influence of christopher marlowe the book itself is divided into six major categories called six revisionary ratios by bloom they are clinamen tessera kenosis daemonization askesis and aprophrades 
an online judge is an online system to test programs in programming contests they are also used to practice for such contests the system can compile and execute your code and test your code with pre constructed data submitted code may be run with restrictions including time limit memory limit security restriction and so on the output of the code will be captured by the system and compared with the standard output the system will then return the result when mistakes were found in a standard output rejudgement using the same method must be made some examples of online judges are 
processing is an open source project initiated by casey reas and benjamin fry both formerly of the aesthetics and computation group at the mit media lab it is a programming language and integrated development environment built for the electronic arts and visual design communities which aims to teach the basics of computer programming in a visual context and to serve as the foundation for electronic sketchbooks one of the stated aims of processing is to act as a tool to get non programmers started with programming through the instant gratification of visual feedback the language builds on the graphical capabilities of the java programming language simplifying features and creating a few new ones 
a non monotonic logic is a formal logic whose consequence relation is not monotonic most studied formal logics have a monotonic consequence relation meaning that adding a formula to a theory never produces a reduction of its set of consequences intuitively monotonicity indicates that learning a new piece of knowledge cannot reduce the set of what is known a monotonic logic cannot handle various reasoning tasks such as reasoning by default abductive reasoning and some important approaches to reasoning about knowledge and similarly belief revision 
the sha hash functions are a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the national security agency and published by the nist as a u s federal information processing standard sha stands for secure hash algorithm the three sha algorithms are structured differently and are distinguished as sha 0 sha 1 and sha 2 the sha 2 family uses an identical algorithm with a variable digest size which is distinguished as sha 224 sha 256 sha 384 and sha 512 sha 1 is the best established of the existing sha hash functions and is employed in several widely used security applications and protocols in 2005 security flaws were identified in sha 1 namely that a possible mathematical weakness might exist indicating that a stronger hash function would be desirable although no attacks have yet been reported on the sha 2 variants they are algorithmically similar to sha 1 and so efforts are underway to develop improved alternatives a new hash standard sha 3 is currently under development the function will be selected via an open competition running between 2008 and 2012 
george boole was an english mathematician and philosopher as the inventor of boolean logic which is the basis of modern digital computer logic boole is regarded in hindsight as one of the founders of the field of computer science boole said  no general method for the solution of questions in the theory of probabilities can be established which does not explicitly recognise  those universal laws of thought which are the basis of all reasoning 
parkinson s law is the adage first articulated by cyril northcote parkinson as the first sentence of a humorous essay published in the economist in 1955 it was later reprinted together with other essays in the book parkinson s law the pursuit of progress he derived the dictum from his extensive experience in the british civil service the current form of the law is not that which parkinson refers to by that name in the article rather he assigns to the term a mathematical equation describing the rate at which bureaucracies expand over time much of the essay is dedicated to a summary of purportedly scientific observations supporting his law such as the increase in the number of employees at the colonial office while great britain s overseas empire declined he explains this growth by two forces an official wants to multiply subordinates not rivals and officials make work for each other he notes in particular that the total of those employed inside a bureaucracy rose by 5 7 per year irrespective of any variation in the amount of work to be done 
flow is the mental state of operation in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing by a feeling of energized focus full involvement and success in the process of the activity proposed by positive psychologist mihÃ¡ly csÃ­kszentmihÃ¡lyi the concept has been widely referenced across a variety of fields colloquial terms for this or similar mental states include to be on the ball in the zone or in the groove 
in computer science polynomial time refers to the running time of an algorithm that is the number of computation steps a computer or an abstract machine requires to evaluate the algorithm an algorithm is said to be polynomial time if its running time is upper bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input for the algorithm problems for which a polynomial time algorithm exists belong to the complexity class ptime which is central in the field of computational complexity theory cobham s thesis states that polynomial time is a synonym for tractable feasible efficient or fast 
in computer science and artificial intelligence ontology languages are formal languages used to construct ontologies they allow the encoding of knowledge about specific domains and often include reasoning rules that support the processing of that knowledge ontology languages are usually declarative languages are almost always generalizations of frame languages and are commonly based on either first order logic or on description logic

doxygen is a documentation generator for c c java objective c python idl fortran vhdl php c and to some extent d it runs on most unix like systems including mac os x as well as on windows the first version of doxygen borrowed some code of an old version of doc later the doxygen code was rewritten by dimitri van heesch doxygen is a tool for writing software reference documentation the documentation is written within code and is thus relatively easy to keep up to date doxygen can cross reference documentation and code so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code kde uses doxygen for parts of its documentation and kdevelop has built in support for it released under the terms of the gnu general public license doxygen is free software 
blum blum shub is a pseudorandom number generator proposed in 1986 by lenore blum manuel blum and michael shub blum blum shub takes the form where m pq is the product of two large primes p and q at each step of the algorithm some output is derived from xn the output is commonly either the bit parity of xn or one or more of the least significant bits of xn the two primes p and q should both be congruent to 3 and gcd Ï should be small an interesting characteristic of the blum blum shub generator is the possibility to calculate any xi value directly 
boosting is a machine learning meta algorithm for performing supervised learning boosting is based on the question posed by kearns can a set of weak learners create a single strong learner a weak learner is defined to be a classifier which is only slightly correlated with the true classification in contrast a strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily well correlated with the true classification the affirmative answer to kearns question has significant ramifications in machine learning and statistics 
type inference or implicit typing refers to the ability to deduce automatically the type of a value in a programming language it is a feature present in some strongly statically typed languages it is often characteristic of but not limited to functional programming languages in general some languages that include type inference are ada bitc boo c 3 0 cayenne clean cobra d epigram f haskell ml nemerle ocaml oxygene scala and visual basic net 9 0 this feature is planned for fortress c 0x and perl 6 the ability to infer types automatically makes many programming tasks easier leaving the programmer free to omit type annotations while maintaining some level of type safety explicitly converting to another data type is called casting 
in computer science concurrency is a property of systems in which several computations are executing simultaneously and potentially interacting with each other the computations may be executing on multiple cores in the same chip preemptively time shared threads on the same processor or executed on physically separated processors a number of mathematical models have been developed for general concurrent computation including petri nets process calculi the synchronous model and the actor model 
computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in computer science that investigates the problems related to the resources required to run algorithms and the inherent difficulty in providing algorithms that are efficient for both general and specific computational problems 
a test case in software engineering is a set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether an application or software system meets specifications the mechanism for determining whether a software program or system has passed or failed such a test is known as a test oracle in some settings an oracle could be a requirement or use case it may take many test cases to determine that a software program or system is functioning correctly test cases are often referred to as test scripts particularly when written written test cases are usually collected into test suites 
in linear algebra a rotation matrix is any matrix that acts as a rotation of euclidean space for example the matrixrotates vectors in the plane counterclockwise by an angle of Î¸ in three dimensions rotation matrices are among the simplest algebraic descriptions of rotations and are used extensively for computations in geometry physics and computer graphics though most applications involve rotations in 2 or 3 dimensions rotation matrices can be defined for n dimensional space algebraically a rotation matrix is an orthogonal matrix whose determinant is equal to 1 rotation matrices are always square and are usually assumed to have real entries though the definition makes sense for other scalar fields the set of all nÂ  Â n rotation matrices forms a group known as the rotation group

in data mining association rule learning is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases piatetsky shapiro describes analyzing and presenting strong rules discovered in databases using different measures of interestingness based on the concept of strong rules agrawal et al introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by point of sale systems in supermarkets for example the rule found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together he or she is likely to also buy beef such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as e g promotional pricing or product placements in addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including web usage mining intrusion detection and bioinformatics 
the open letter to hobbyists was an open letter written by bill gates the co founder of microsoft to early personal computer hobbyists in which gates expresses dismay at the rampant copyright infringement taking place in the hobbyist community particularly with regard to his company s software the letter dated february 3 1976 was published in the homebrew computer club newsletter and was written in response to an incident at an earlier club meeting an unknown person had brought a copy of microsoft altair basic on paper tape to that meeting dan sokol a semiconductor engineering manager took that tape and made more than seventy copies of it which were then distributed at the next meeting free of charge in the letter gates expressed frustration with most computer hobbyists who were using his company s altair basic software without having paid for it he asserted that such widespread unauthorized copying in effect discourages developers from investing time and money into creating quality software he cited the unfairness of gaining the benefits of software authors time effort and capital without paying that author anything 
an interface in the java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify an interface that classes must implement interfaces are declared using the interface keyword and may only contain method signatures and constant declarations an interface may never contain method definitions as interfaces are implicitly abstract they cannot be directly instantiated except when instantiated by a class which implements the said interface the class must implement all of the methods described in the interface or be an abstract class object references in java may be specified to be of an interface type in which case they must either be null or be bound to an object which implements the interface one benefit of using interfaces is that they simulate multiple inheritance all classes in java must have exactly one base class multiple inheritance of classes is not allowed however a java class interface may implement extend any number of interfaces 
a microformat is a web based approach to semantic markup that seeks to re use existing xhtml and html tags to convey metadata and other attributes this approach allows information intended for end users to also be automatically processed by software although the content of web pages is technically already capable of automated processing and has been since the inception of the web such processing is difficult because the traditional markup tags used to display information on the web do not describe what the information means microformats are intended to bridge this gap by attaching semantics and thereby obviate other more complicated methods of automated processing such as natural language processing or screen scraping the use adoption and processing of microformats enables data items to be indexed searched for saved or cross referenced so that information can be reused or combined current microformats allow the encoding and extraction of events contact information social relationships and so on more are being developed version 3 of the firefox browser as well as version 8 of internet explorer are expected to include native support for microformats 
an annotation in the java computer programming language is a special form of syntactic metadata that can be added to java source code classes methods variables parameters and packages may be annotated unlike javadoc tags java annotations are reflective in that they are embedded in class files generated by the compiler and may be retained by the java vm to be made retrievable at run time 
xlib is an x window system protocol client library in the c programming language it contains functions for interacting with an x server these functions allow programmers to write programs without knowing the details of the protocol few applications use xlib directly rather they employ other libraries that use xlib functions to provide widget toolkits xlib appeared around 1985 and is currently used in guis for many unix like operating systems the xcb library is an attempt to replace xlib 
an application programming interface is a set of routines data structures object classes and or protocols provided by libraries and or operating system services in order to support the building of applications an api may be the api itself is largely abstract in that it specifies an interface and controls the behavior of the objects specified in that interface the software that provides the functionality described by an api is said to be an implementation of the api an api is typically defined in terms of the programming language used to build an application the related term abi is a lower level definition concerning details at the assembly language level for example the linux standard base is an abi while posix is an api the api acronym may sometimes be used as a reference not only to the full interface but also to a single function or even a set of multiple apis provided by an organization thus the scope is usually determined by the person or document that communicates the information 
the perceptron is a type of artificial neural network invented in 1957 at the cornell aeronautical laboratory by frank rosenblatt it can be seen as the simplest kind of feedforward neural network a linear classifier 
reconfigurable computing is a computing paradigm combining some of the flexibility of software with the high performance of hardware by processing with very flexible high speed computing fabrics like fpgas the principal difference when compared to using ordinary microprocessors is the ability to make substantial changes to the datapath itself in addition to the control flow on the other hand the main difference with custom hardware is the possibility to adapt the hardware during runtime by loading a new circuit on the reconfigurable fabric 
the avr is a modified harvard architecture 8 bit risc single chip microcontroller which was developed by atmel in 1996 the avr was one of the first microcontroller families to use on chip flash memory for program storage as opposed to one time programmable rom eprom or eeprom used by other microcontrollers at the time 
an aa tree in computer science is a form of balanced tree used for storing and retrieving ordered data efficiently aa trees are named for arne andersson their inventor aa trees are a variation of the red black tree which in turn is an enhancement to the binary search tree unlike red black trees red nodes on an aa tree can only be added as a right subchild in other words no red node can be a left sub child this results in the simulation of a 2 3 tree instead of a 2 3 4 tree which greatly simplifies the maintenance operations the maintenance algorithms for a red black tree need to consider seven different shapes to properly balance the tree 
the x86 instruction set has undergone numerous changes over time most of them were to add new functionality to the instruction set 
the following is a complete list of colors with their associated articles note that a large percentage of the color swatches below are taken from domain specific naming schemes such as x11 or html4 rgb values are given for each swatch because such standards are defined in terms of the srgb color space it is not possible to accurately convert many of these swatches to cmyk values because of the differing gamuts of the two spaces but the color management systems built into operating systems and image editing software can attempt such conversions as accurately as possible the hsv color space values also known as hsb and the hex triplets are also given in the following table colors which appear on the web safe color paletteÂ  which includes the sixteen named colorsÂ  are noted the appearance of the actual color swatches displayed below will vary depending on many parameters such as the properties of the display device its color management settings and the viewing surround conditions note also that color naming is fuzzy and arbitrary and varies among people and cultures no single swatch is adequately representative of any particular color name additionally computer displays have a somewhat limited gamut so many colorful pigments cannot be represented on screen at all and computer simulation of the natural world is at best a rough approximation

satisfiability is the problem of determining if the variables of a given boolean formula can be assigned in such a way as to make the formula evaluate to true equally important is to determine whether no such assignments exist which would imply that the function expressed by the formula is identically false for all possible variable assignments in this latter case we would say that the function is unsatisfiable otherwise it is satisfiable to emphasize the binary nature of this problem it is frequently referred to as boolean or propositional satisfiability the shorthand sat is also commonly used to denote it with the implicit understanding that the function and its variables are all binary valued 
a use case in software engineering and systems engineering is a description of a system s behaviour as it responds to a request that originates from outside of that system in other words a use case describes who can do what with the system in question the use case technique is used to capture a system s behavioral requirements by detailing scenario driven threads through the functional requirements 
a bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their probabilistic independencies for example a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms given symptoms the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases formally bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs whose nodes represent variables and whose missing edges encode conditional independencies between the variables nodes can represent any kind of variable be it a measured parameter a latent variable or a hypothesis they are not restricted to representing random variables which represents another bayesian aspect of a bayesian network efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning in bayesian networks bayesian networks that model sequences of variables are called dynamic bayesian networks generalizations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams 
in computer security a sandbox is a security mechanism for separating running programs it is often used to execute untested code or untrusted programs from unverified third parties suppliers and untrusted users the sandbox typically provides a tightly controlled set of resources for guest programs to run in such as scratch space on disk and memory network access the ability to inspect the host system or read from input devices are usually disallowed or heavily restricted in this sense sandboxes are a specific example of virtualization some examples of sandboxes are 
in mathematics a unit circle is a circle with a unit radius i e a circle whose radius is 1 frequently especially in trigonometry the unit circle is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin in the cartesian coordinate system in the euclidean plane the unit circle is often denoted s1 the generalization to higher dimensions is the unit sphere if is a point on the unit circle in the first quadrant then x and y are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle whose hypotenuse has length 1 thus by the pythagorean theorem x and y satisfy the equationsince x2 2 for all x and since the reflection of any point on the unit circle about the x or y axis is also on the unit circle the above equation holds for all points on the unit circle not just those in the first quadrant one may also use other notions of distance to define other unit circles such as the riemannian circle see the article on mathematical norms for additional examples

with respect to a computer filesystem an access control list is a list of permissions attached to an object the list specifies who or what is allowed to access the object and what operations are allowed to be performed on the object in a typical acl each entry in the list specifies a subject and an operation for example the entry on the acl for file wxy gives alice permission to delete file wxy 
django is an open source web application framework written in python which loosely follows the model view controller design pattern it was originally developed to manage several news oriented sites for the world company of lawrence kansas and was released publicly under a bsd license in july 2005 the framework was named after gypsy jazz guitarist django reinhardt in june 2008 it was announced that a newly formed django software foundation will take care of django in the future django s primary goal is to ease the creation of complex database driven websites django emphasizes reusability and pluggability of components rapid development and the principle of dry python is used throughout even for settings files and data models django also provides an optional administrative crud interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models 
scheme is a multi paradigm programming language it is one of the two main dialects of lisp and supports a number of programming paradigms but is best known for its support of functional programming it was developed by guy l steele and gerald jay sussman in the 1970s scheme was introduced to the academic world via a series of papers now referred to as sussman and steele s lambda papers there are two standards that define the scheme language the official ieee standard and a de facto standard called the revisedn report on the algorithmic language scheme nearly always abbreviated rnrs where n is the number of the revision the most widely implemented standard is r5rs and on august 28 2007 r6rs the next major revision of the scheme language was ratified with about two thirds of the voters in favor of r6rs scheme s philosophy is minimalist scheme provides as few primitive notions as possible and where practical lets everything else be provided by programming libraries scheme was the first dialect of lisp to choose static over dynamic variable scope it was also one of the first programming languages to support first class continuations 
a flowchart is common type of chart that represents an algorithm or process showing the steps as boxes of various kinds and their order by connecting these with arrows flowcharts are used in analyzing designing documenting or managing a process or program in various fields 
boolean algebra is a logical calculus of truth values developed by george boole in the late 1830s it resembles the algebra of real numbers as taught in high school but with the numeric operations of multiplication xy addition xÂ  Â y and negation x replaced by the respective logical operations of conjunction x y disjunction x y and complement x the boolean operations are these and all other operations that can be built from these such x these turn out to coincide with the set of all operations on the set 0 1 that take only finitely many arguments there are 22n such operations when there are n arguments the laws of boolean algebra can be defined axiomatically as certain equations called axioms together with their logical consequences called theorems or semantically as those equations that are true for every possible assignment of 0 or 1 to their variables the axiomatic approach is sound and complete in the sense that it proves respectively neither more nor fewer laws than the semantic approach 
a checksum or hash sum is a fixed size datum computed from an arbitrary block of digital data for the purpose of detecting accidental errors that may have been introduced during its transmissions or storage the integrity of the data can be checked at any later time by recomputing the checksum and comparing it with the stored one if the checksums do not match the data was certainly altered the procedure that yields the checksum from the data is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm a good checksum algorithm will yield a different result with high probability when the data is accidentally corrupted if the checksums match the data is very likely to be free of accidental errors checksum functions are related to hash functions fingerprints randomisation functions and cryptographic hash functions however each of those concepts has different applications and therefore different design goals check digits and parity bits are special cases of checksums appropriate for small blocks of data some error correcting codes are based on special checksums that not only detect common errors but also allow the original data to be recovered in certain cases 
in software engineering an anti pattern is a design pattern that appears obvious but is ineffective or far from optimal in practice the term was coined in 1995 by andrew koenig inspired by gang of four s book design patterns which developed the concept of design patterns in the software field the term was widely popularized three years later by the book antipatterns which extended the use of the term beyond the field of software design and into general social interaction according to the authors of the latter there must be at least two key elements present to formally distinguish an actual anti pattern from a simple bad habit bad practice or bad idea often pejoratively named with clever oxymoronic neologisms many anti pattern ideas amount to little more than mistakes rants unsolvable problems or bad practices to be avoided if possible sometimes called pitfalls or dark patterns this informal use of the term has come to refer to classes of commonly reinvented bad solutions to problems thus many candidate anti patterns under debate would not be formally considered anti patterns by formally describing repeated mistakes one can recognize the forces that lead to their repetition and learn how others have refactored themselves out of these broken patterns 
parrot is a register based virtual machine being developed using the c programming language and intended to run dynamic languages efficiently it uses just in time compilation for speed to reduce the interpretation overhead it is currently possible to compile parrot assembly language and pir to parrot bytecode and execute it parrot is an open source project distributed with a free software licence making parrot free software parrot was started by the perl community and is developed with help from the open source and free software communities as a result it is focused on license compatibility platform compatibility across a broad array of systems processor architectures compatibility across most modern processors speed of execution small size and being flexible enough to handle the varying demands of perl and most if not all other modern dynamic languages it is also focusing on improving introspection debugger capabilities and compile time semantic modulation version 1 0 with a stable api for development was released on march 17 2009

xmlhttprequest is a dom api that can be used inside a web browser scripting language such as javascript to send an http request directly to a web server and load the server response data directly back into the scripting language once the data is within the scripting language it is available as both an xml document if the response was valid xml markup and as plain text the xml data can easily be used to manipulate the currently active document in the browser without the need of the client loading a new web page document plain text data can be evaluated within the scripting language to manipulate the document too in the example of javascript the plain text may be formatted as json by the web server and evaluated within javascript to create an object of data for use on the current dom this type of ajax architecture should not be confused with xdomainrequest which is a lightweight form of the xmlhttprequest design by microsoft which doesn t utilize xml rpc xmlhttprequest is an important part of the ajax web development technique and it is used by many websites to implement responsive and dynamic web applications examples of web applications that make use of xmlhttprequest include google maps windows live s virtual earth the mapquest dynamic map interface facebook and many others 
c is a general purpose programming language it is regarded as a middle level language as it comprises a combination of both high level and low level language features it was developed by bjarne stroustrup in 1979 at bell labs as an enhancement to the c programming language and originally named c with classes it was renamed to c in 1983 c is widely used in the software industry some of its application domains include systems software application software device drivers embedded software high performance server and client applications and entertainment software such as video games several groups provide both free and proprietary c compiler software including the gnu project microsoft intel borland and others the language began as enhancements to c first adding classes then virtual functions operator overloading multiple inheritance templates and exception handling among other features after years of development the c programming language standard was ratified in 1998 as iso iec 14882 1998 that standard is still current but is amended by the 2003 technical corrigendum iso iec 14882 2003 the next standard version is in development c is a statically typed free form multi paradigm compiled language where compilation creates machine code for a target machine hardware 
in mathematics a combinadic is an ordered integer partition or composition combinadics provide a lexicographical index for combinations applications for combinadics include software testing sampling quality control and the analysis of gambling games such as canada s national 6 49 lottery for definiteness we will consider the k combinations on the set s 0 1  nÂ  Â 1 of the first n integers starting from 0 recall that there are c n  of these the index we are looking for is the mapping associating the numbers i 0 1  cÂ  Â 1 with the list of k combinations having their elements written in ascending order and themselves ordered lexicographically by abuse of notation we denote as c the ith k combination taken from the set of n elements then the index for the ten 3 combinations of the set of five elements 0 1 2 3 4 can be written out as follows the definition we want for an ith combinadic m on the c k combinations of the set of n elements is most directly achieved by first considering the list of all possible words n letters long consisting of k 1s and nÂ  Â k 0s we designate the letter positions or places in the word as nÂ  Â 1 nÂ  Â 2  1 0 in descending order lowest letter position on the right then the ith combinadic in this system is defined to be the ordered n tuple consisting of the letter positions for the 1s in the nth word in lexicographical order reading from left to right we can now write out the combinadics for the ten 3 combinations of the set of five elements in the following table clearly the combinadics also list all the k combinations from the set of n elements in lexicographical order but here the elements are listed in decreasing not increasing order in this msdn article james d mccaffrey shows that the conventional combinations index is easily obtained from the combinadics the more useful composition based definition for a combinadic can be illustrated using an example consider the combinadic with index 72 in the system of 5 combinations from the set of 10 elements this is m  by studying the seventy three words consisting of five 1s and five 0s that lead up to this combinadic it becomes clear that there is a simple relationship between the numbers in the combinadic code and an ordered partition of the index number notice first of all that between reference a and reference b the five 1s run through all the possible patterns among the eight rightmost places 0 1 2  7 in the word there are c 56 of these so since reference a is at index 0 reference b has to be at index cÂ  Â 1 55 at the next index reference c the leftmost 1 achieves its final resting place of position 8 on index c 56 while the remaining four 1s are reset to the far right of the word next notice that between reference c and reference d the remaining four 1s run through all the possible patterns in the six rightmost places 0 1 2  5 in the word there are c 15 of these so reference d lies at index cÂ  Â cÂ  Â 1 70 and the next index reference e where the second leftmost 1 achieves its final resting place of position 6 and the remaining three 1s are reset to the right is index cÂ  Â c 71 the three rightmost 1s run through the single 1 pattern on the three rightmost places before the third rightmost 1 takes up its final station at place 3 at reference f the two rightmost 1s run through no 0 patterns before the second rightmost 1 doesn t move similarly the one rightmost 1 runs through no 0 patterns before it doesn t move the relationship between combinadics and ordered integer partitions is formalized in the following clearly the index value i for any combinadic can be immediately calculated from its elements to get the elements of the combinadic m from its index i we first find the largest first element mk 1 so that c is less than or equal to i the second element is found by repeating the procedure in the reduced combinadic system where i is reduced by the previous c n is set to the previous mk 1 and k is reduced by one this is continued until k is reduced to zero as mccaffrey points out in his msdn article efficiently finding the largest mk 1 is the key to calculating a k combination from its index value combinadics unlike factoradics does not appear to be a numeral system although it has very much the look and feel of one in particular it is different from a mixed radix system

theory of constraints is an overall management philosophy introduced by dr eliyahu m goldratt in his 1984 book titled the goal that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals according to rand a system s constraint is that part of the system that constrains the objective of the system goldratt states that in our reality any system has very few constraints  and at the same time any system in reality must have at least one constraint while he makes passing reference to proofs based on lp and sensitivity analysis goldratt s main argument is the line of marching soldiers analogy the toc process of ongoing improvement seeks to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it through the use of the five focusing steps 
linus s law can refer to two different notions both named after linus torvalds 
fuzzy sets are sets whose elements have degrees of membership fuzzy sets have been introduced by lotfi a zadeh as an extension of the classical notion of set in classical set theory the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a bivalent condition an element either belongs or does not belong to the set by contrast fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set this is described with the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval fuzzy sets generalize classical sets since the indicator functions of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets if the latter only take values 0 or 1 
a shared nothing architecture is a distributed computing architecture in which each node is independent and self sufficient and there is no single point of contention across the system people typically contrast sn with systems that keep a large amount of centrally stored state information whether in a database an application server or any other similar single point of contention while sn is best known in the context of web development the concept predates the web michael stonebraker at uc berkeley used the term in a 1986 database paper and it is possible that earlier references also exist shared nothing is popular for web development because of its scalability as google has demonstrated a pure sn system can scale almost infinitely simply by adding nodes in the form of inexpensive computers since there is no single bottleneck to slow the system down google calls this sharding an sn system typically partitions its data among many nodes on different databases or may require every node to maintain its own copy of the application s data using some kind of coordination protocol this is often referred to as database sharding there is some doubt about whether a web application with many independent web nodes but a single shared database should be counted as sn one of the approaches to achieve sn architecture for stateful applications is the use of a data grid also known as distributed caching this still leaves the centralized database as a single point of failure

strategyin computer programming lazy evaluation is the technique of delaying a computation until such time as the result of the computation is known to be needed the attractions of lazy evaluation include performance increases due to avoiding unnecessary calculations avoiding error conditions in the evaluation of compound expressions the ability to construct infinite data structures and the ability to define control structures as regular functions rather than built in primitives languages that use lazy actions can be further subdivided into those that use a call by name evaluation strategy and those that use call by need most realistic lazy languages such as haskell use call by need for performance reasons but theoretical presentations of lazy evaluation often use call by name for simplicity the opposite of lazy actions is eager evaluation also known as strict evaluation eager evaluation is the evaluation behavior used in most programming languages

hick s law named after british psychologist william edmund hick or the hick hyman law describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has given n equally probable choices the average reaction time t required to choose among them is approximatelywhere b is a constant that can be determined empirically by fitting a line to measured data operation of logarithm here expresses depth of choice tree hierarchy basically log2 means that you perform binary search according to card moran and newell the 1 is because there is uncertainty about whether to respond or not as well as about which response to make the law can be generalized in the case of choices with unequal probabilities pi of occurring towhere h is the information theoretic entropy of the decision defined ashick s law is similar in form to fitts s law intuitively one can reason that hick s law has a logarithmic form because people subdivide the total collection of choices into categories eliminating about half of the remaining choices at each step rather than considering each and every choice one by one requiring linear time hick s law has been shown to apply in experiments where the user is presented with n buttons each having a light bulb beside them one light bulb is randomly lit up after which the user must press the corresponding button as quickly as possible obviously the decision to be made here is very simple requiring little conscious thought hick s law is sometimes cited to justify menu design decisions however applying the model to menus must be done with care for example to find a given word in a randomly ordered word list scanning of each word in the list is required consuming linear time so hick s law does not apply however if the list is alphabetical and the user knows the name of the command he or she may be able to use a subdividing strategy that works in logarithmic time for hick s law and fitts s law considerations in the context of menu and submenu design see landauer and nachbar 
static code analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs built from that software in most cases the analysis is performed on some version of the source code and in the other cases some form of the object code the term is usually applied to the analysis performed by an automated tool with human analysis being called program understanding or program comprehension the sophistication of the analysis performed by tools varies from those that only consider the behavior of individual statements and declarations to those that include the complete source code of a program in their analysis uses of the information obtained from the analysis vary from highlighting possible coding errors to formal methods that mathematically prove properties about a given program it can be argued that software metrics and reverse engineering are forms of static analysis a growing commercial use of static analysis is in the verification of properties of software used in safety critical computer systems and locating potentially vulnerable code

this article describes in computing the calling conventions used on the x86 architecture calling conventions describe the interface of called code a closely related topic is name mangling which determines how symbol names in the code map to symbol names used by the linker it should be noted that there are often subtle differences in how various compilers implement these conventions so it is often difficult to interface code which is compiled by different compilers on the other hand conventions which are used as an api standard are necessarily very uniformly implemented 
the mythical man month essays on software engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by fred brooks whose central theme is that adding manpower to a late software project makes it later this idea is known as brooks law and is presented along with the second system effect and advocacy of prototyping the work was first published in 1975 reprinted with corrections in 1982 and republished as an anniversary edition with four extra chapters in 1995 with the essay no silver bullet and commentary by the author brooks s observations are based on his experiences at ibm while managing the development of os 360 he had mistakenly added more workers to a project falling behind schedule he also made the mistake of asserting that one project writing an algol compiler would require six months regardless of the number of workers involved the tendency for managers to repeat such errors in project development led brooks to quip that his book is called the bible of software engineering because everybody reads it but nobody does anything about it

presentation abstraction control is a software architectural pattern somewhat similar to model view controller pac is used as a hierarchical structure of agents each consisting of a triad of presentation abstraction and control parts the agents communicate with each other only through the control part of each triad it also differs from mvc in that within each triad it completely insulates the presentation and the abstraction this provides the option to separately multithread the model and view which can give the user experience of very short program start times as the user interface can be shown before the abstraction has fully initialized 
a software release is the distribution of an initial or upgraded version of a computer software product the software engineers and company doing the work decide on how to distribute the program or system or changes to that pre downloads and compact discs the software release life cycle is composed of different stages that describe the stability of a piece of software and the amount as the development process proceeds in contrast to alpha and beta versions the pre alpha is not feature complete when it is used it refers to all activities performed during the software project prior to software testing these activities can include requirements analysis software design software development and unit testing in typical open source development there are several types of pre alpha versions milestone versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the functionality is complete nightly builds are versions that are usually automatically checked out from the revision control system and built typically over night these versions allow the testers to test the recently implemented functionality immediately and find the new bugs 
given a connected undirected graph a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph which is a tree and connects all the vertices together a single graph can have many different spanning trees we can also assign a weight to each edge which is a number representing how unfavorable it is and use this to assign a weight to a spanning tree by computing the sum of the weights of the edges in that spanning tree a minimum spanning tree or minimum weight spanning tree is then a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree more generally any undirected graph has a minimum spanning forest which is a union of minimum spanning trees for its connected components one example would be a cable tv company laying cable to a new neighborhood if it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths then there would be a graph representing which points are connected by those paths some of those paths might be more expensive because they are longer or require the cable to be buried deeper these paths would be represented by edges with larger weights a spanning tree for that graph would be a subset of those paths that has no cycles but still connects to every house there might be several spanning trees possible a minimum spanning tree would be one with the lowest total cost 
memcached is a general purpose distributed memory caching system that was originally developed by danga interactive for livejournal but is now used by many other sites it is often used to speed up dynamic database driven websites by caching data and objects in memory to reduce the number of times an external data source must be read memcached is distributed under a permissive free software license memcached lacks authentication and security features meaning it should only be used on servers with a firewall set up appropriately by default memcached uses the port 11211 among other technologies it uses libevent memcached s apis provides a giant hash table distributed across multiple machines when the table is full subsequent inserts cause older data to be purged in least recently used order applications using memcached typically layer memcached requests and additions into core before falling back on a slower backing store such as a database the system is used by several very large well known sites including youtube livejournal slashdot wikipedia wikimedia wikia sourceforge metacafe gamefaqs facebook digg twitter fotolog nytimes com deviantart jamendo the pirate bay and netlog

open financial exchange arising from microsoft s ofc and intuit s open exchange is a data stream format for exchanging financial information the ofx standard was announced on the 16 january 1997 by microsoft intuit and checkfree and was designed as a unified technical specification to converge their respective mechanisms the specification allows for bank and application specific extensions although only a subset is necessary to describe a financial transaction since the current version is a flavour of xml it is simple to create well formed ofx documents versions 1 0 1 6 relied on sgml for data exchange whereas all versions since are xml based according to the main ofx site the specification is freely licensed allowing any software developer to design an interface that will be supported on the front end qfx is a proprietary variant of ofx used in intuit s products confusingly intuit s documentation uses the term ofx when in reality the products only work with qfx 
tex is a typesetting system designed and mostly written by donald knuth together with the metafont language for font description and the computer modern family of typefaces it was designed with two main goals in mind to allow anybody to produce high quality books using a reasonable amount of effort and to provide a system that would give the exact same results on all computers now and in the future within the typesetting system its name is formatted as tex tex is considered by many to be the best way to typeset complex mathematical formulae tex is popular in academia especially in the mathematics computer science and physics communities it has largely displaced unix troff the other favored formatter in many unix installations which use both for different purposes it is now also being used for many other typesetting tasks especially in the form of latex and other template packages the widely used mime type for tex is application x tex tex is free software 
a b testing or split testing is a method of advertising testing by which a baseline control sample is compared to a variety of single variable test samples in order to improve response rates a classic direct mail tactic this method has been recently adopted within the interactive space to test tactics such as banner ads emails and landing pages significant improvements can be seen through testing elements like copy text layouts images and colors however not all elements produce the same improvements and by looking at the results from different tests it is possible to identify those elements that consistently tend to produce the greatest improvements employers of this a b testing method will distribute multiple samples of a test including the control to see which single variable is most effective in increasing a response rate or other desired outcome the test in order to be effective must reach an audience of a sufficient size that there is a reasonable chance of detecting a meaningful difference between the control and other tactics see statistical power this method is different than multivariate testing which applies statistical modeling which allows a tester to try multiple variables within the samples distributed 
jodi or jodi org is a collective of two internet artists joan heemskerk and dirk paesmans their background is in photography and video art since the mid 1990s they started to create original artworks for the world wide web a few years later they also turned to software art and artistic computer game modification since 2002 they have been in what has been called their screen grab period making video works by recording the computer monitor s output while working playing video games or coding to those that aren t in on their conceptual jokes jodi s works seem inaccessible and impenetrable appearing to make the user s computer run amok for example their 1995 work wwwwwwwww jodi org appears at first glance to consist of meaningless text until a glance at the html source code reveals detailed diagrams of hydrogen and uranium bombs their early work often used this tactic of mimicking computer glitches and viruses as an aesthetic or humorous device in more recent works they modified old video games such as wolfenstein 3d quake jet set willy and the latest max payne 2 to create a new set of art games jodi s approach to game modification is comparable in many ways to deconstructivism in architecture because they would disassemble the game to its basic parts and reassemble it in ways that do not make intuitive sense one of their more well known modifications of quake places the player inside a closed cube with swirling black and white patterns on each side the pattern is the result of a glitch in the game engine discovered by the artists presumably through trial and error it is generated live as the quake engine tries and fails to visualize the interior of a cube with black and white checked wallpaper jodi s screen grab period began with the four screen video installation my desktop which premiered at the plugin media lab in basel the piece appeared to depict mammoth macintosh os 9 computers running amok opening windows cascaded across the screen error messages squawked and files replicated themselves endlessly but this was not a computer gone haywire but a computer user gone haywire to make this video jodi simply pointed and clicked dragged and dropped so frantically it seemed that no human could be in control of such chaos as graphics exploded across the screen the viewer gradually realized that what had initially appeared to be a computer glitch was really the work of an irrational playful or crazed human jodi s work has been included in many international exhibitions and festivals including documenta x in 1997 they received a webby award in the arts category in 1999 as their mandatory five word acceptance speech they exclaimed ugly corporate sons of bitches 
mxml is an xml based user interface markup language first introduced by macromedia in march 2004 adobe systems gives no official meaning for the acronym but some developers suggest it should stand for magic extensible markup language it s likely that the name comes from the mx suffix given to macromedia studio products released in 2002 and 2004 application developers use mxml in combination with actionscript to develop rich internet applications with products such as adobe flex mxml is used mainly to declaratively lay out the interface of applications and can also be used to implement business logic and internet application behaviors common practices are employed in the language syntax such as the use of curly braces to force the computer to evaluate an expression and dot notation to drill down through an object mxml is often used with flex server which dynamically compiles it into standard binary swf files however adobe s flex builder ide and free flex sdk can also generate swf files from mxml for use without flex server there is also a php pear package called xml_mxml which is a framework to build adobe flex applications mxml is considered a proprietary standard due to its tight integration with adobe technologies it is like xaml in this respect no published translators exist for converting an mxml document to another user interface language such as uiml xul xforms xaml or svg mxml is also a generic event log format used by a number of process mining tools as a transfer format between application specific log content and the process mining tool here is some sample mxml application code 
in dos os 2 and microsoft windows a batch file is a text file containing a series of commands intended to be executed by the command interpreter when a batch file is run the shell program reads the file and executes its commands normally line by line batch files are useful for running a sequence of executables automatically and are often used by system administrators to automate tedious processes linux has a similar type of file called a shell script dos batch files have the filename extension bat batch files for other environments may have different extensions e g cmd in windows nt and os 2 or btm in 4dos and related shells the windows 9x family only recognizes the bat extension 
a partial list of the most common commands for dos follows in versions 5 of dos and later the user can get help by typing help at the shell prompt to get help on a dos command the command line switch can be used for example to get help for the xcopy command type the following at the dos prompt the operating system will execute the command and the parameter instructs the command to display a help page about itself in this case xcopy to view this help page see the xcopy entry on this page in the list below when a command can accept more than one filename or a filename including wildcards it is said to accept a filespec parameter commands that can accept only a single filename are said to accept a filename parameter for most of the commands the unix equivalent is given it should be noted that unix commands typically provide ranges of functionality and flexibility that are not approached by the equivalent dos command so all comparisons are approximate for example the dos commands copy and xcopy are said to be equivalent to the unix cp command but in reality cp has much greater power than copy and a similar functionality to xcopy while many commands are the same across many dos systems some differ in command syntax or name in dos commands unlike unix lower case and capital letters are equivalent it is usual for parameters or arguments also to be independent of case sometimes a hyphen may be used instead of a slash commands which are not part of the operating system may follow the same conventions but this is not necessarily the case when using a command whose syntax is not known it can be convenient to type the command with no arguments and with   h  h and even help in the expectation that one of these will display brief information 
prototype based programming is a style of object oriented programming in which classes are not present and behavior reuse is performed via a process of cloning existing objects that serve as prototypes this model can also be known as class less prototype oriented or instance based programming the original example of a prototype based language is the programming language self developed by david ungar and randall smith however the classless programming style has recently grown increasingly popular and has been adopted for the programming languages javascript cecil newtonscript io moo rebol lisaac and several others 
a database transaction comprises a unit of work performed within a database management system against a database and treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions transactions in a database environment have two main purposes a database transaction by definition must be atomic consistent isolated and durable database practitioners often refer to these properties of database transactions using the acronym acid transactions provide an all or nothing proposition stating that each work unit performed in a database must either complete in its entirety or have no effect whatsoever further the system must isolate each transaction from other transactions results must conform to existing constraints in the database and transactions that complete successfully must get written to durable storage sap also refer to transactions as luws logical units of work

procedural generation is a widely used term in the production of media indicating the possibility to create content on the fly rather than prior to distribution this is often related to computer graphics applications and video game level design 
in computer programming particularly in the c and c programming languages a header file or include file is a file usually in the form of source code that a compiler automatically includes when processing another source file typically programmers specify the inclusion of header files via compiler directives at the beginning of the other source file a header file commonly contains forward declarations of classes subroutines variables and other identifiers programmers who wish to declare standardized identifiers in more than one source file can place such identifiers in a single header file which other code can then include whenever the header contents are required the c standard library and c standard library traditionally declare their standard functions in header files

a dwarf is a creature from germanic mythologies fairy tales fantasy fiction and role playing games it usually has magical talents often involving metallurgy the original concept of dwarves is very difficult to determine the sources closest to the original germanic mythology come from norse mythology but even these are scarce and varied sources have gradually given dwarves more comical and superstitious roles dwarves were certainly humanoid but sources differ over their height their lifestyles and their similarity to elves considering early sources and considering the dwarves nature original dwarves seem fully human height they had strong associations with death paled skin dark hair connections with the earth their role in mythology they followed animistic traditions showing similarities to such concepts of the dead they were similar to others from the vÃ¦ttir family such as elves as their mythology evolved the most notable changes have had them become more comical and more mysterious they adopted the modern image of short height and ugliness their associations with the underground became more predominant dwarves were magical creatures with huge skill at metallurgy taking fame for making great artifacts of legend late norse concepts of dwarves became quite different from the early ones the legendary saga shows the new trend the remnants of the original dwarf formed later fairy tales and folklore they had become unseen magical creatures like fairies users of charms curses and deceit modern fantasy and literature have formed an intriguing web of concepts from that of the original dwarf to the dwarf of later norse mythology the dwarf of folk tales and of other mythology the typical modern dwarf has distinctive features such as short stature excessive hair and skill at mining and metallurgy however modern literature draws from a wide range and dwarves vary in fidelity to historical notions many fantasists devise new powers or images for dwarves modern dwarves have no strict definition the conception of dwarves as short is probably the most tenacious and the term dwarf can now describe short humans regardless of its mythical origins the universal modern description of a dwarf is something short usually associated with magic fantasy and fairy tales 
in object oriented programming and software engineering the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure upon which it operates a practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures thus using the visitor pattern helps conformance with the open closed principle in essence the visitor allows one to add new virtual functions to a family of classes without modifying the classes themselves instead one creates a visitor class that implements all of the appropriate specializations of the virtual function the visitor takes the instance reference as input and implements the goal through double dispatch while powerful the visitor pattern is more limited than conventional virtual functions it is not possible to create visitors for objects without adding a small callback method inside each class and the callback method in each of the classes is not inheritable 
in computer programming intentional programming is a collection of concepts which enable software source code to reflect the precise information called intention which programmers had in mind when conceiving their work by closely matching the level of abstraction at which the programmer was thinking browsing and maintaining computer programs becomes easier the concept was introduced by long time microsoft employee charles simonyi who led a team in microsoft research which developed an integrated development environment called ip that demonstrates these concepts for reasons that are unclear microsoft stopped working on intentional programming and ended development of ip in the early 2000s an overview of intentional programming is given in chapter 11 of the book generative programming methods tools and applications

multipurpose internet mail extensions is an internet standard that extends the format of e mail to support mime s use however has grown beyond describing the content of e mail to describing content type in general including for the web virtually all human written internet e mail and a fairly large proportion of automated e mail is transmitted via smtp in mime format internet e mail is so closely associated with the smtp and mime standards that it is sometimes called smtp mime e mail the content types defined by mime standards are also of importance outside of e mail such as in communication protocols like http for the world wide web http requires that data be transmitted in the context of e mail like messages even though the data may not actually be e mail mime is specified in six linked rfc memoranda rfc 2045 rfc 2046 rfc 2047 rfc 4288 rfc 4289 and rfc 2049 which together define the specifications 
in computer storage technology a page is a fixed length block of memory that is used as a unit of transfer between physical memory and external storage like a disk and a page fault is an interrupt to the software raised by the hardware when a program accesses a page that is mapped in address space but not loaded in physical memory the hardware that detects this situation is the memory management unit in a processor the exception handling software that handles the page fault is generally part of an operating system the operating system tries to handle the page fault by making the required page accessible at a location in physical memory or kills the program in case it is an illegal access contrary to what their name might suggest page faults are not necessarily fatal and are common and necessary to increase the amount of memory available to programs in any operating system that utilizes virtual memory including microsoft windows mac os x linux and unix note that microsoft uses the term hard fault in its resource monitor to mean page fault 
in computer science a metaobject or meta object is any entity that manipulates creates describes or implements other objects the object that the metaobject is about is called the base object some information that a metaobject might store is the base object s type interface class methods attributes variables functions control structures etc a metaobject protocol is an interpreter of the semantics of a program that is open and extensible therefore a mop determines what a program means and what its behavior is and it is extensible in that a programmer can alter program behavior by extending parts of the mop the mop exposes some or all internal structure of the interpreter to the programmer the mop may manifest as a set of classes and methods that allow a program to inspect the state of the supporting system and alter its behaviour mops are implemented as object oriented programs where all objects are metaobjects mops may be runtime or compile time the metaobjects of runtime mops exist while the program itself is executed the metaobjects of compile time mops however exist only when the program is compiled they may alter or extend the compiling process but do not exist when the program is running one of the best known runtime mops is the one described in the book the art of the metaobject protocol it applies to the common lisp object system and allows the mechanisms of inheritance method dispatch class instantiation and so on to be manipulated a good example of a compile time mop is openc one example use of a mop is to alter the implementation of multiple inheritance a recurring issue is how to resolve conflicting slots and methods of the superclasses typically language designers select one solution and language users must live with it instead a metaobject protocol makes it possible to change the rules of inheritance and choose a different solution for individual classes a metaobject protocol is one way to implement aspect oriented programming languages many of the early founders of mops including gregor kiczales have since moved on to be the primary advocates for aspect oriented programming 
in computer science a dynamic array growable array resizable array dynamic table or array list is an array data structure that can be resized and allows elements to be added or removed it is supplied with standard libraries in many modern mainstream programming languages a dynamic array is not the same thing as a dynamically allocated array which is a fixed size array whose size is fixed when the array is allocated for more information of this type of array see array

mojave experimentdevelopment of windows vista occurred over the span of five and a half years starting in earnest in may 2001 prior to the release of microsoft s windows xp operating system and continuing until november 2006 microsoft originally expected to ship the new version sometime late in 2003 as a minor step between windows xp and blackcomb vista s original codename longhorn was an allusion to this plan while whistler and blackcomb are large ski resorts in british columbia longhorn is the name of a bar between the two mountains that whistler s visitors pass to reach blackcomb gradually longhorn assimilated many of the important new features and technologies slated for blackcomb resulting in the release date being pushed back a few times many of microsoft s developers were also re tasked with improving the security of windows xp faced with ongoing delays and concerns about feature creep microsoft announced on august 27 2004 that it was making significant changes longhorn development basically started afresh building on the windows server 2003 codebase and re incorporating only the features that would be intended for an actual operating system release some previously announced features such as winfs and ngscb were dropped or postponed after longhorn was named windows vista in mid 2005 an unprecedented beta test program was started which involved hundreds of thousands of volunteers and companies between september 2005 and october 2006 microsoft released regular community technology previews to beta testers and two release candidates to the general public development of windows vista came to a conclusion with the november 8 2006 announcement of its completion by co president of windows development jim allchin

microsoft silverlight is a programmable web browser plugin that enables features such as animation vector graphics and audio video playback that characterizes rich internet applications version 2 0 released october 2008 brought additional interactivity features and support for net languages and development tools microsoft made the beta of silverlight 3 0 available on 2009 03 18 it is compatible with multiple web browser products used on microsoft windows and mac os x operating systems mobile devices starting with windows mobile 6 and symbian phones will also be supported a third party free software implementation named moonlight is under development to bring compatible functionality to gnu linux 
winfs is the code name for a data storage and management system based on relational databases developed by microsoft and first demonstrated in 2003 as an advanced storage subsystem for the microsoft windows operating system designed for persistence and management of structured semi structured as well as unstructured data winfs includes a relational database for storage of information and allows any type of information to be stored in it provided there is a well defined schema for the type individual data items could then be related together by relationships which are either inferred by the system based on certain attributes or explicitly stated by the user as the data has a well defined schema any application can reuse the data and using the relationships related data can be effectively organized as well as retrieved because the system knows the structure and intent of the information it can be used to make complex queries that enable advanced searching through the data and aggregating various data items by exploiting the relationships between them while winfs and its shared type schema makes it possible for an application to recognize the different data types the application still has to be coded to render the different data types consequently it would not allow development of a single application that can view or edit all data types rather what winfs enables applications to understand is the structure of all data and extract the information that it can use further when winfs was introduced at the 2003 professional developers conference microsoft also released a video presentation named iwish showing mockup interfaces that showed how applications would expose interfaces that takes advantage of a unified type system the concepts shown in the video ranged from applications using the relationships of items to dynamically offer filtering options to applications grouping multiple related data types and rendering them in a unified presentation winfs was billed as one of the pillars of the longhorn wave of technologies and would ship as part of the next version of windows it was subsequently decided that winfs would ship after the release of windows vista but those plans were shelved in june 2006 with some of its component technologies being integrated into upcoming releases of ado net and microsoft sql server while it was then assumed by observers that winfs was finished as a project in november 2006 steve ballmer announced that winfs was still in development though it was not clear how the technology was to be delivered 
the two s complement of a binary number is defined as the value obtained by subtracting the number from a large power of two a two s complement system or two s complement arithmetic is a system in which negative numbers are represented by the two s complement of the absolute value this system is the most common method of representing signed integers on computers in such a system a number is negated by computing its two s complement an n bit two s complement numeral system can represent every integer in the range 2n 1 to 2n 1 1 the two s complement system has the advantage of not requiring that the addition and subtraction circuitry examine the signs of the operands to determine whether to add or subtract this property makes the system both simpler to implement and capable of easily handling higher precision arithmetic also zero has only a single representation obviating the subtleties associated with negative zero which exists in ones complement systems the method of complements can also be applied in base 10 arithmetic using ten s complements by analogy with two s complements

a parallel programming model is a set of software technologies to express parallel algorithms and match applications with the underlying parallel systems it encloses the areas of applications programming languages compilers libraries communications systems and parallel i o due to the difficulties in automatic parallelization today people have to choose a proper parallel programming model or a form of mixture of them to develop their parallel applications on a particular platform parallel models are implemented in several ways as libraries invoked from traditional sequential languages as language extensions or complete new execution models they are also roughly categorized for two kinds of systems shared memory system and distributed memory system though the lines between them are largely blurred nowadays a programming model is usually judged by its expressibility and simplicity which are by all means conflicting factors the ultimate goal is to improve productivity of programming

markov decision processes named after andrey markov provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of the decision maker mdps are useful for studying a wide range of optimization problems solved via dynamic programming and reinforcement learning mdps were known at least as early as the 1950s much research in the area was spawned due to ronald a howard s book dynamic programming and markov processes in 1960 today they are used in a variety of areas including robotics automated control economics and in manufacturing more precisely a markov decision process is a discrete time stochastic control process characterized by a set of states in each state there are several actions from which the decision maker must choose for a state s and an action a a state transition function pa determines the transition probabilities to the next state the decision maker earns a reward for each state transition the state transitions of an mdp possess the markov property given the state of the mdp at time t is known transition probabilities to the state at time t 1 are independent of all previous states or actions markov decision processes are an extension of markov chains the difference is the addition of actions and rewards if there were only one action or if the action to take were fixed for each state a markov decision process would reduce to a markov chain 
in computer operating systems that have their main memory divided into pages paging is a transfer of pages between main memory and an auxiliary store such as hard disk drive paging is an important part of virtual memory implementation in most contemporary general purpose operating systems allowing them to use disk storage for data that does not fit into physical ram paging is usually implemented as architecture specific code built into the kernel of the operating system 
fuzz testing fuzzing or negative testing is a software testing technique that provides invalid unexpected or random data to the inputs of a program if the program fails the defects can be noted the great advantage of fuzz testing is that the test design is extremely simple and free of preconceptions about system behavior 
the analytical engine an important step in the history of computers was the design of a mechanical general purpose computer by the british mathematician charles babbage it was first described in 1837 but babbage continued to work on the design until his death in 1871 because of financial political and legal issues the engine was never built in its logical design the machine was essentially modern anticipating the first completed general purpose computers by about 100Â years some believe that the technological limitations of the time were a further obstacle to the construction of the machine others believe that the machine could have been built successfully with the technology of the era if funding and political support had been stronger charles babbage was notoriously hard to work with and alienated a great number of people who had at first supported him including his engineer joseph clement 
quirks mode refers to a technique used by some web browsers for the sake of maintaining backward compatibility with web pages designed for older browsers instead of strictly complying with w3c and ietf standards in standards mode 
in mathematics the polar coordinate system is a two dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by an angle and a distance the polar coordinate system is especially useful in situations where the relationship between two points is most easily expressed in terms of angles and distance in the more familiar cartesian or rectangular coordinate system such a relationship can only be found through trigonometric formulation as the coordinate system is two dimensional each point is determined by two polar coordinates the radial coordinate and the angular coordinate the radial coordinate denotes the point s distance from a central point known as the pole the angular coordinate denotes the positive or anticlockwise angle required to reach the point from the 0 ray or polar axis

the open source initiative is an organization dedicated to promoting open source software the organization was founded in february 1998 by bruce perens and eric s raymond prompted by netscape communications corporation publishing the source code for its flagship netscape communicator product later in august 1998 the organization added a board of directors raymond was president from its founding until february 2005 the current president is michael tiemann 
in computing there are circumstances in which the outputs of all procedures solving a particular type of problem are statistically identical a colorful way of describing such a circumstance introduced by david h wolpert and william g macready in connection with the problems of search and optimization is to say that there is no free lunch wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning before wolpert s article was published cullen schaffer had summarized a preprint version of this work of wolpert s but used different terminology in the no free lunch metaphor each restaurant has a menu associating each lunch plate with a price the menus of restaurants are identical except in one regard the prices are shuffled from one restaurant to the next for an omnivore who is as likely to order each plate as any other the average cost of lunch does not depend on the choice of restaurant but a vegan who goes to lunch regularly with a carnivore who seeks economy pays a high average cost for lunch to methodically reduce the average cost one must use advance knowledge of a what one will order and b what the order will cost at various restaurants that is improvement of performance in problem solving hinges on using prior information to match procedures to problems in formal terms there is no free lunch when the probability distribution on problem instances is such that all problem solvers have identically distributed results in the case of search a problem instance is an objective function and a result is a sequence of values obtained in evaluation of candidate solutions in the domain of the function for typical interpretations of results search is an optimization process there is no free lunch in search if and only if the distribution on objective functions is invariant under permutation of the space of candidate solutions this condition does not hold precisely in practice but an no free lunch theorem suggests that it holds approximately

a browser helper object is a dll module designed as a plugin for microsoft s internet explorer web browser to provide added functionality bhos were introduced in october 1997 with the release of version 4 of internet explorer most bhos are loaded once by each new instance of internet explorer however in the case of the windows explorer a new instance is launched for each window some modules enable the display of different file formats not ordinarily interpretable by the browser the adobe acrobat plugin that allows internet explorer users to read pdf files within their browser is a bho other modules add toolbars to internet explorer such as the alexa toolbar that provides a list of web sites related to the one you are currently browsing or the google toolbar that adds a toolbar with a google search box to the browser user interface 
in cryptography the advanced encryption standard is an encryption standard adopted by the u s government the standard comprises three block ciphers aes 128 aes 192 and aes 256 adopted from a larger collection originally published as rijndael each aes cipher has a 128 bit block size with key sizes of 128 192 and 256 bits respectively the aes ciphers have been analyzed extensively and are now used worldwide as was the case with its predecessor the data encryption standard aes was announced by national institute of standards and technology as u s fips pub 197 on november 26 2001 after a 5 year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before rijndael was selected as the most suitable it became effective as a standard may 26 2002 as of 2009 aes is one of the most popular algorithms used in symmetric key cryptography it is available in many different encryption packages aes is the first publicly accessible and open cipher approved by the nsa for top secret information the rijndael cipher was developed by two belgian cryptographers joan daemen and vincent rijmen and submitted by them to the aes selection process rijndael is a portmanteau of the names of the two inventors and is pronounced 
latent semantic analysis is a technique in natural language processing in particular in vectorial semantics of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms lsa was patented in 1988 by scott deerwester susan dumais george furnas richard harshman thomas landauer karen lochbaum and lynn streeter in the context of its application to information retrieval it is sometimes called latent semantic indexing 
the state pattern is a behavioral software design pattern also known as the objects for states pattern this pattern is used in computer programming to represent the state of an object this is a clean way for an object to partially change its type at runtime take for example a drawing program in which there could be an abstract interface representing a tool then concrete instances of that class could each represent a kind of tool when the user selects a different tool the appropriate tool would be instantiated 
in computer science a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children typically the child nodes are called left and right binary trees are commonly used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps 
the java native interface is a programming framework that allows java code running in a java virtual machine to call and to be called by native applications and libraries written in other languages such as c c and assembly 
software versioning is the process of assigning either unique version names or unique version numbers to unique states of computer software within a given version number category these numbers are generally assigned in increasing order and correspond to new developments in the software at a fine grained level revision control is often used for keeping track of incrementally different versions of electronic information whether or not this information is actually computer software 
edsger wybe dijkstra was a dutch computer scientist he received the 1972 a m turing award for fundamental contributions in the area of programming languages and was the schlumberger centennial chair of computer sciences at the university of texas at austin from 1984 until 2000 shortly before his death in 2002 he received the acm podc influential paper award in distributed computing for his work in the subarea of self stabilization this annual award was renamed the dijkstra prize the following year in his honour 
clean room design is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights and trade secrets associated with the original design clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright and trade secret infringement because it relies on independent invention however because independent invention is not a defense against patents clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions the term implies that the design team works in an environment that is clean or demonstrably uncontaminated by any knowledge of the proprietary techniques used by the competitor typically a clean room design is done by having someone examine the system to be reimplemented and having this person write a specification this specification is then reviewed by a lawyer to ensure that no copyrighted material is included the specification is then implemented by a team with no connection to the original examiners 
javadoc is a documentation generator from sun microsystems for generating api documentation in html format from java source code the doc comments format used by javadoc is the de facto industry standard for documenting java classes some ides such as netbeans and eclipse will automatically generate javadoc html many file editors will assist the user in producing javadoc source and will use the javadoc info as internal references for the programmer javadoc also provides an api for creating doclets and taglets which allows you to analyze the structure of a java application this is how jdiff can generate reports of what changed between two versions of an api 
the rich text format is a document file format developed by microsoft in 1987 for cross platform document interchange most word processors are able to read and write rtf documents it should not be confused with enriched text or its predecessor rich text which are completely different specifications 
in computer security and programming a buffer overflow or buffer overrun is an anomalous condition where a process attempts to store data beyond the boundaries of a fixed length buffer the result is that the extra data overwrites adjacent memory locations the overwritten data may include other buffers variables and program flow data and may result in erratic program behavior a memory access exception program termination incorrect results or especially if deliberately caused by a malicious user a possible breach of system security buffer overflows can be triggered by inputs specifically designed to execute malicious code or to make the program operate in an unintended way as such buffer overflows cause many software vulnerabilities and form the basis of many exploits sufficient bounds checking by either the programmer the compiler or the runtime can prevent buffer overflows the programming languages most commonly associated with buffer overflows are c and c they provide no built in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not check that data written to an array is within the boundaries of that array

in computing the executable and linking format is a common standard file format for executables object code shared libraries and core dumps first published in the system v application binary interface specification and later in the tool interface standard it was quickly accepted among different vendors of unix systems in 1999 it was chosen as the standard binary file format for unix and unix like systems on x86 by the 86open project unlike many proprietary executable file formats elf is very flexible and extensible and it is not bound to any particular processor or architecture this has allowed it to be adopted by many different operating systems on many different platforms the elf format has replaced older executable formats such as a out and coff in many unix like operating systems such as linux solaris irix freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonfly bsd syllable and hp ux elf has also seen some adoption in non unix operating systems such as the itanium version of openvms and beos revision 4 and later for x86 based computers the playstation portable playstation 2 playstation 3 wii nintendo ds and gp2x consoles also use elf amigaos 4 and morphos also running on powerpc machines use elf on the amiga platform the elf executable has replaced the previous ehf which was used on amigas equipped with ppc processor expansion cards the symbian os v9 uses e32image format that is based on elf file format most sony ericsson some siemens and motorola phones can run elf files through the use of a patch that adds assembly code to the main firmware the elf file format is also used as a generic object and executable format for binary images used with embedded processors 
the burrows wheeler transform is an algorithm used in data compression techniques such as bzip2 it was invented by michael burrows and david wheeler in 1994 while working at dec systems research center in palo alto california it is based on a previously unpublished transformation discovered by wheeler in 1983 when a character string is transformed by the bwt none of its characters change value the transformation permutes the order of the characters if the original string had several substrings that occurred often then the transformed string will have several places where a single character is repeated multiple times in a row this is useful for compression since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move to front transform and run length encoding for example the output is easier to compress because it has many repeated characters 
bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low level device control error detection and correction algorithms encryption algorithms and optimization for most other tasks modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions source code that does bit manipulation makes use of the bitwise operations and or xor not and bit shifts bit manipulation in some cases can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a data structure and can give many fold speed ups as bit manipulations are processed in parallel but the code can become rather more difficult to write and maintain 
algol is a family of imperative computer programming languages originally developed in the mid 1950s which greatly influenced many other languages and became the de facto way algorithms were described in textbooks and academic works for almost the next 30 years it was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with fortran and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages algol introduced code blocks and was the first language to use begin end pairs for delimiting them fragments of algol like syntax are sometimes still used as a notation for algorithms so called pidgin algol there were three major specifications niklaus wirth based his own algol w on algol 60 before moving to develop pascal algol w was intended to be the next generation algol but the algol 68 committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified algol 60 the official algol versions are named after the year they were first published algol68 is substantially different from algol60 but was not well received so that in general algol means dialects of algol60

constructive solid geometry is a technique used in solid modeling csg is often but not always a procedural modeling technique used in 3d computer graphics and cad constructive solid geometry allows a modeler to create a complex surface or object by using boolean operators to combine objects often csg presents a model or surface that appears visually complex but is actually little more than cleverly combined or decombined objects the simplest solid objects used for the representation are called primitives typically they are the objects of simple shape cuboids cylinders prisms pyramids spheres cones the set of allowable primitives is limited by each software package some software packages allow csg on curved objects while other packages do not it is said that an object is constructed from primitives by means of allowable operations which are typically boolean operations on sets union intersection and difference a primitive can typically be described by a procedure which accepts some number of parameters for example a sphere may be described by the coordinates of its center point along with a radius value these primitives can be combined into compound objects using operations like these combining these elementary operations it is possible to build up objects with high complexity starting from simple ones 
physical computing in the broadest sense means building interactive physical systems by the use of software and hardware that can sense and respond to the analog world while this definition is broad enough to encompass things such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes it is not commonly used to describe them in the broad sense physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings relationship to the digital world in practical use the term most often describes handmade art design or diy hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system and or control electro mechanical devices such as motors servos lighting or other hardware

language oriented programming is a style of computer programming via metaprogramming in which rather than solving problems in general purpose programming languages the programmer creates one or more domain specific programming languages for the problem first and solves the problem in those languages this concept is described in detail in the paper by martin ward entitled language oriented programming published in software concepts and tools vol 15 no 4 pp 147 161 1994 and in the article by sergey dmitriev entitled language oriented programming the next programming paradigm existing implementations of this concept include a book that describes this concept with examples is building better applications a theory of efficient software development it takes the approach to capture requirements in the user s terms and then to try to create an implementation language as isomorphic as possible to the user s descriptions so that the mapping between requirements and implementation is as direct as possible a measure of the closeness of this isomorphism is the redundancy of the language defined as the number of editing operations needed to implement a stand alone change in requirements it is not assumed a priori what is the best language for implementing the new language rather the developer can choose among options created by analysis of the information flows what information is acquired what its structure is when it is acquired from whom and what is done with it see linguistic method 
common lisp commonly abbreviated cl is a dialect of the lisp programming language published in ansi standard document information technology programming language common lisp formerly x3 226 1994 developed to standardize the divergent variants of lisp which predated it it is not an implementation but rather a language specification several implementations of the common lisp standard are available including proprietary products and open source software common lisp is a general purpose multi paradigm programming language it supports a combination of procedural functional and object oriented programming paradigms as a dynamic programming language it facilitates rapid development with iterative compilation into efficient run time programs common lisp includes clos an object system that supports multimethods and method combinations it is extensible through standard features such as lisp macros and reader macros 
the term computer numbering formats refers to the schemes implemented in digital computer and calculator hardware and software to represent numbers a common mistake made by non specialist computer users is a certain misplaced faith in the infallibility of numerical computations for example if one multiplies one might perhaps expect to get a result of exactly 1 which is the correct answer when applying an exact rational number or algebraic model in practice however the result on a digital computer or calculator may prove to be something such as 0 9999999999999999 or in certain cases perhaps 0 99999999923475 the latter result seems to indicate a bug but it is actually an unavoidable consequence of the use of a binary floating point approximation decimal floating point computer algebra systems and certain bignum systems would give either the answer of 1 or 0 9999999999999999 
in computing a process is an instance of a computer program that is being sequentially executed by a computer system that has the ability to run several computer programs concurrently a computer program itself is just a passive collection of instructions while a process is the actual execution of those instructions several processes may be associated with the same program for example opening up several instances of the same program often means more than one process is being executed in the computing world processes are formally defined by the operating system running them and so may differ in detail from one os to another a single computer processor executes one or more instructions at a time one after the other to allow users to run several programs at once single processor computer systems can perform time sharing time sharing allows processes to switch between being executed and waiting to be executed in most cases this is done very rapidly providing the illusion that several processes are executing at once using more than one physical processor on a computer permits true simultaneous execution of more than one stream of instructions from different processes but time sharing is still typically used to allow more than one process to run at a time different processes may share the same set of instructions in memory but this is not known to any one process each execution of the same set of instructions is known as an instance a completely separate instantiation of the program for security and reliability reasons most modern operating systems prevent direct communication between independent processes providing strictly mediated and controlled inter process communication functionality

referential transparency and referential opaqueness are properties of parts of computer programs an expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program the opposite term is referentially opaque while in mathematics all function applications are referentially transparent in programming this is not always the case the importance of referential transparency is that it allows a programmer to reason about program behavior this can help in proving correctness simplifying an algorithm assisting in modifying code without breaking it or optimizing code by means of memoization common subexpression elimination or parallelization referential transparency is one of the principles of functional programming only referentially transparent functions can be memoized some programming languages provide means to guarantee referential transparency some functional programming languages enforce referential transparency for all functions as referential transparency requires the same results for a given set of inputs at any point in time a referentially transparent expression is therefore deterministic by definition 
in mathematics a graph is an abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links the interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions called vertices and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges typically a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots for the vertices joined by lines or curves for the edges for example a graph may be constructed by choosing the vertices to be the first 1000 positive integers and defining that there is an edge between two vertices if and only if those two integers have at least one decimal digit in common in other cases the relationship between vertices is not symmetric for example a graph may be constructed by choosing the vertices to be the first 1000 positive integers and defining that there is an edge from i to j if i is a divisor of j this type of graph is called a directed graph and the edges are called directed edges or arcs in contrast a graph where the edges are not directed is called undirected vertices are also called nodes or points and edges are also called lines graphs are the basic subject studied by graph theory

z39 50 is a client server protocol for searching and retrieving information from remote computer databases it is covered by ansi niso standard z39 50 and iso standard 23950 the standard s maintenance agency is the library of congress z39 50 is widely used in library environments and is often incorporated into integrated library systems and personal bibliographic reference software interlibrary catalogue searches for interlibrary loan are often implemented with z39 50 queries work on the z39 50 protocol began in the 1970s and led to successive versions in 1988 1992 and 1995 it supports a number of actions including search retrieval sort and browse searches are expressed using attributes typically from the bib 1 attribute set which defines six attributes to be used in searches of information on the server computer use relation position structure truncation completeness the syntax of the z39 50 protocol allows for very complex queries in practice however the functional complexity is limited by the uneven implementations by developers and commercial vendors the syntax of z39 50 is abstracted from the underlying database structure for example if the client specifies an author search it is up to the server to determine how to map that search to the indexes it has at hand this allows z39 50 queries to be formulated without having to know anything about the target database but it also means that results for the same query can vary widely among different servers one server may have an author index another may use its index of personal names whether they are authors or not another may have no suitable index and fall back on its keyword index and another may have no suitable index and return an error an attempt to remedy this situation is the bath profile this document rigidly specifies the exact search syntax to employ for common bibliographic searches and the expected behavior of bath compliant servers in response to these searches implementation of the bath profile has been slow but is gradually improving the z39 50 landscape the bath profile is maintained by library and archives canada z39 50 is a pre web technology and various working groups are attempting to update it to fit better into the modern environment these attempts fall under the designation zing and pursue various strategies the most important are the twin protocols sru srw which drop the z39 50 communications protocol but attempt to preserve the benefits of the query syntax sru is rest based and enables queries to be expressed in url query strings srw uses soap both expect search results to be returned as xml since these projects allow the relatively small market for library software to benefit from the web service tools developed for much larger markets they have a much lower barrier to entry for developers than the original z39 50 protocol the common query language is based on z39 50 semantics

in computing a named pipe is an extension to the traditional pipe concept on unix and unix like systems and is one of the methods of inter process communication macos calls them a socket and should not be confused with a tcp socket the concept is also found in microsoft windows although the semantics differ substantially a traditional pipe is unnamed because it exists anonymously and persists only for as long as the process is running a named pipe is system persistent and exists beyond the life of the process and must be unlinked or deleted once it is no longer being used processes generally attach to the named pipe to perform ipc 
np hard in computational complexity theory is a class of problems informally at least as hard as the hardest problems in np a problem h is np hard if and only if there is an np complete problem l that is polynomial time turing reducible to h i e in other words l can be solved in polynomial time by an oracle machine with an oracle for h informally we can think of an algorithm that can call such an oracle machine as subroutine for solving h and solves l in polynomial time if the subroutine call takes only one step to compute np hard problems may be of any type decision problems search problems optimization problems as consequences of such definition we have a common mistake is to think that the np in np hard stands for non polynomial although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial time algorithms for these problems this has never been proven 
in mathematics and computer science the adjacency matrix of a finite directed or undirected graph g on n vertices is the n n matrix where the nondiagonal entry aij is the number of edges from vertex i to vertex j and the diagonal entry aii is either twice the number of loops at vertex i or just the number of loops there exists a unique adjacency matrix for each graph and it is not the adjacency matrix of any other graph in the special case of a finite simple graph the adjacency matrix is a matrix with zeros on its diagonal if the graph is undirected the adjacency matrix is symmetric another matrix representation for a graph is the incidence matrix the relationship between a graph and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its adjacency matrix is studied in spectral graph theory

in the field of relational database design normalization is a systematic way of ensuring that a database structure is suitable for general purpose querying and free of certain undesirable characteristics insertion update and deletion anomalies that could lead to a loss of data integrity e f codd the inventor of the relational model introduced the concept of normalization and what we now know as the first normal form in 1970 codd went on to define the second and third normal forms in 1971 and codd and raymond f boyce defined the boyce codd normal form in 1974 higher normal forms were defined by other theorists in subsequent years the most recent being the sixth normal form introduced by chris date hugh darwen and nikos lorentzos in 2002 informally a relational database table is often described as normalized if it is in the third normal form most 3nf tables are free of insertion update and deletion anomalies i e in most cases 3nf tables adhere to bcnf 4nf and 5nf a standard piece of database design guidance is that the designer should begin by fully normalizing the design and selectively denormalize only in places where doing so is absolutely necessary to address performance issues however some modeling disciplines such as the dimensional modeling approach to data warehouse design explicitly recommend non normalized designs i e designs that in large part do not adhere to 3nf 
resource acquisition is initialization often referred to by the acronym raii is a popular design pattern in several object oriented programming languages like c d and ada the technique invented by bjarne stroustrup ensures that when resources are acquired they are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of suitable objects resources are acquired during the initialization of objects when there is no chance of using them before the resource is available and released with the destruction of the same objects which is guaranteed to take place even in case of errors in c objects residing on the stack are automatically destroyed when the enclosing scope is exited including the case of exceptions their destructor is called before the exception propagates raii helps in writing exception safe code to release resources before permitting exceptions to propagate one can write appropriate destructors once rather than dispersing and duplicating cleanup logic between exception handling blocks

microsoft infopath is an application used to develop xml based data entry forms first released as part of the microsoft office 2003 suite of programs in late 2003 and later released as part of microsoft office 2007 initially given the codename xdocs the main feature of infopath is its ability to author and view xml documents with support for custom defined xml schemata it can connect to external systems using xml web services through msxml and the soap toolkit and back end and middle tier systems can be configured to communicate by using web services standards such as soap uddi and wsdl additionally because infopath documents are raw xml it is possible to directly repurpose the data in other xml processors in infopath the user can complete a form while off line infopath may check some fields on the form for validity and the user can attach a digital signature the user later connects to the server and submits the form which may be routed for approval when the user connects to the server the form template may be automatically updated 
in computer science dancing links also known as dlx is the technique suggested by donald knuth to efficiently implement his algorithm x algorithm x is a recursive nondeterministic depth first backtracking algorithm that finds all solutions to the exact cover problem some of the better known exact cover problems include tiling the n queens problem and sudoku the name dancing links comes from the way the algorithm works as iterations of the algorithm cause the links to dance with partner links so as to resemble an exquisitely choreographed dance knuth credits hirosi hitotumatu and kohei noshita with having invented the idea in 1979 but it is his paper which has popularized it 
in computer science tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once in a systematic way such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited the following algorithms are described for a binary tree but they may be generalized to other trees as well 
wikitext language or wiki markup is a markup language that offers a simplified alternative to html and is used to write pages in wiki websites such as wikipedia there is no commonly accepted standard wikitext language the grammar structure features keywords and so on are dependent on the particular wiki software used on the particular website for example all wikitext markup languages have a simple way of hyperlinking to other pages within the site but there are several different syntax conventions for these links many wikis especially the earlier ones use camelcase to mark words that should be automatically linked in some wikis this convention was abandoned in favor of explicit link markup which wikipedia calls free links for example with many wiki programs allow extensive optional use of select html elements within wikitext others a smaller subset and still others no html at all in some cases restrictions on html may be wisely determined by each site that uses the program mediawiki the software that runs wikipedia has a wiki markup language that allows many common html tags it is intended to provide an alternative syntax to allow some users to use it without knowing html

corpus linguistics is the study of language as expressed in samples or real world text this method represents a digestive approach to deriving a set of abstract rules by which a natural language is governed or else relates to another language originally done by hand corpora are largely derived by an automated process which is corrected the corpus approach runs counter to noam chomsky s view that real language is riddled with performance related errors thus requiring careful analysis of small speech samples obtained in a highly controlled laboratory setting the problem of laboratory selected sentences is similar to that facing lab based psychology researchers do not have any measure of the ethnographic representativity of their data corpus linguistics does away with chomsky s competence performance split adherents believe that reliable language analysis best occurs on field collected samples in natural contexts and with minimal experimental interference within cl there are divergent views as to the value of corpus annotation from john sinclair advocating minimal annotation and allowing texts to speak for themselves to others such as the survey of english usage team advocating annotation as a path to greater linguistic understanding and rigour 
in computer software a data access object is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or persistence mechanism providing some specific operations without exposing details of the database it provides a mapping from application calls to the persistence layer this isolation separates the concerns of what data accesses the application needs in terms of domain specific objects and data types and how these needs can be satisfied with a specific dbms database schema etc this design pattern is equally applicable to most programming languages most types of software with persistence needs and most types of database but it is traditionally associated with java ee applications and with relational databases accessed via the jdbc api because of its origin in sun microsystems best practice guidelines for that platform

a web crawler is a computer program that browses the world wide web in a methodical automated manner other terms for web crawlers are ants automatic indexers bots and worms or web spider web robot or especially in the foaf community web scutter this process is called web crawling or spidering many sites in particular search engines use spidering as a means of providing up to date data web crawlers are mainly used to create a copy of all the visited pages for later processing by a search engine that will index the downloaded pages to provide fast searches crawlers can also be used for automating maintenance tasks on a web site such as checking links or validating html code also crawlers can be used to gather specific types of information from web pages such as harvesting e mail addresses a web crawler is one type of bot or software agent in general it starts with a list of urls to visit called the seeds as the crawler visits these urls it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of urls to visit called the crawl frontier urls from the frontier are recursively visited according to a set of policies 
the web application description language is an xml based file format that provides a machine readable description of http based web applications these applications are typically rest web services the purpose of wadl is to allow services on the internet to be described in a machine processable way to make it easier to create web 2 0 style applications and create a dynamic way of creating and configuring services prior to this it was necessary to go to an existing web service study it and write the application manually wadl can be thought of as the rest equivalent of web services description language version 1 1 version 2 0 of wsdl can be used to describe rest web services thus competing with wadl wadl is intended for applications that are based on the existing architecture of the web like wsdl it is platform and language independent and aims to promote re use of applications beyond the basic use in a web browser wadl models the resources provided by a service and the relationships between them the service is described using a set of resource elements each of these contains param elements to describe the inputs and method elements which describe the request and response of a resource the request element specifies how to represent the input what types are required and any specific http headers that are required the response describes the representation of the service s response as well as any fault information to deal with errors wadl is not yet widely supported it has the advantage over the more complicated wsdl in that it does not impose any further level of abstraction on the service description however as tools become available for application development with wadl it is likely they will include ways of automatically generating wadl and this risks imposing an rpc style on it going against the intended simplicity of wadl

the bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering which is meant to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently the bridge uses encapsulation aggregation and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes when a class varies often the features of object oriented programming become very useful because changes to a program s code can be made easily with minimal prior knowledge about the program the bridge pattern is useful when both the class as well as what it does varies the class itself can be thought of as the implementation and what the class can do as the abstraction variant the implementation can be decoupled even more by deferring the presence of the implementation to the point where the abstraction is utilized 
in computer science garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management the garbage collector or just collector attempts to reclaim garbage or memory used by objects that will never be accessed or mutated again by the application garbage collection was invented by john mccarthy around 1959 to solve the problems of manual memory management in lisp garbage collection is often portrayed as the opposite of manual memory management which requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system however many systems use a combination of the two approaches and there are other techniques being studied to solve the same fundamental problem 
a glitch is a short lived fault in a system the term is particularly common in the computing and electronics industries and in circuit bending as well as among players of video games although it is applied to all types of systems including human organizations and nature the term derives from the german glitschig meaning slippery possible entering english through the yiddish term glitsh normally a glitch occurs once but can also occur multiple times in a particular software

the 24 hour clock is a convention of time keeping in which the day runs from midnight to midnight and is divided into 24 hours numbered from 0 to 23 this system is the most commonly used time notation in the world today the 12 hour clock is however still dominant in a handful of countries particularly the united states canada and australia 24 hour notation is also popularly referred to as military time or astronomical time in the us and canada and in australia in some parts of the world it is called railway time it is also the international standard notation of time in the practice of medicine the 24 hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it precludes any ambiguity as to what time events occurred in the patient s medical history 
in graph theory the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized an example is finding the quickest way to get from one location to another on a road map in this case the vertices represent locations and the edges represent segments of road and are weighted by the time needed to travel that segment formally given a weighted graph and one element v of v find a path p from v to each v of v so thatis minimal among all paths connecting v to v the problem is also sometimes called the single pair shortest path problem to distinguish it from the following generalizations these generalizations have significantly more efficient algorithms than the simplistic approach of running a single pair shortest path algorithm on all relevant pairs of vertices

the head related transfer function hrtf also called the anatomical transfer function atf describes how a given sound wave input is filtered by the diffraction and reflection properties of the head pinna and torso before the sound reaches the transduction machinery of the eardrum and inner ear biologically the source location specific prefiltering effects of these external structures aid in the neural determination of source location particularly the determination of source elevation linear systems analysis defines the transfer function as the complex ratio between the output signal spectrum and the input signal spectrum as a function of frequency blauert initially defined the transfer function as the free field transfer function fftf other terms include free field to eardrum transfer function and the pressure transformation from the free field to the eardrum less specific descriptions include the pinna transfer function the outer ear transfer function the pinna response directional transfer function dtf or what is commonly termed the head related transfer function hrtf the transfer function h of any linear time invariant system at frequency f is one method used to obtain the hrtf from a given source location is therefore to measure the head related impulse response hrir h at the ear drum for the impulse Î´ placed at the source the hrtf h is the fourier transform of the hrir h even when measured for a dummy head of idealized geometry head related transfer functions are complicated functions of frequency and the three spatial variables for distances greater than 1Â m from the head however the hrtf can be said to attenuate inversely with range it is this far field hrtf h that has most often been measured at closer range the difference in level observed between the ears can grow quite large even in the low frequency region within which negligible level differences are observed in the far field hrtfs are typically measured in an anechoic chamber to minimize the influence of early reflections and reverberation on the measured response hrtfs are measured at small increments of Î¸ such as 15 or 30 in the horizontal plane with interpolation used to synthesize hrtfs for arbitrary positions of Î¸ even with small increments however interpolation can lead to front back confusion and optimizing the interpolation procedure is an active area of research humans are less sensitive to changes in the azimuth Ï and hrtfs are often measured only on the horizontal plane or with 45 increments in the median plane in order to maximize the signal to noise ratio in a measured hrtf it is important that the impulse being generated be of high volume in practice however it can be difficult to generate impulses at high volumes and if generated they can be damaging to human ears so it is more common for hrtfs to be directly calculated in the frequency domain using a frequency swept sine wave or by using maximum length sequences user fatigue is still a problem however highlighting the need for the ability to interpolate based on fewer measurements head related transfer functions have to do with a person s ability to localize sound the ability to localize sound is not something that people are born with a baby has to train its auditory system to recognize where certain sounds are located the head related transfer function is involved in resolving the cone of confusion a series of points where itd and iid are identical for sound sources from many locations around the 0 part of the cone when a sound is received by the ear it can either go straight down the ear into the ear canal or it can be reflected off the pinnae of the ear into the ear canal a fraction of a second later the sound will contain many frequencies so therefore many copies of this signal will go down the ear all at different times depending on their frequency these copies overlap each other and during this certain signals are enhanced while other copies are canceled out essentially the brain is looking for frequency notches in the signal that correspond to particular known directions of sound if another person s ears were substituted the individual would not immediately be able to localize sound as the patterns of enhancement and cancellation would be different from those patterns the person s auditory system is used to however after some weeks the auditory system would adapt to the new head related transfer function

in combinatorial mathematics a k ary de bruijn sequence b of order n named after the dutch mathematician nicolaas govert de bruijn is a cyclic sequence of a given alphabet a with size k for which every possible subsequence of length n in a appears as a sequence of consecutive characters exactly once such a sequence has the following properties according to de bruijn himself the existence of de bruijn sequences for each order together with the above properties were first proved for the case of alphabets with two elements by camille flye sainte marie in 1894 whereas the generalization to larger alphabets is originally due to tanja van ardenne ehrenfest and himself 
in computer programming an assertion is a predicate placed in a program to indicate that the developer thinks that the predicate is always true at that place for example the following code contains two assertions x 0 and x 1 and they are indeed true at the indicated points during execution assertions are used to help specify programs and to reason about program correctness for example a precondition an assertion placed at the beginning of a section of code determines the set of states under which the code is expected to be executed a postcondition placed at the end describes the expected state at the end of execution the example above uses the notation for including assertions used by c a r hoare in his 1969 paper that notation cannot be used in existing mainstream programming languages however programmers can include unchecked assertions using the comment feature of their programming language here is an example using c the braces are included in the comment in order to help distinguish this use of a comment from other uses several modern programming languages include checked assertions statements that are checked at runtime or sometimes statically if an assertion evaluates to false at run time an assertion failure results which typically causes execution to abort this draws attention to the location at which the logical inconsistency is detected and can be preferable to the behaviour that would otherwise result the use of assertions helps the programmer design develop and reason about a program

the graphics device interface is a microsoft windows application programming interface and core operating system component that is responsible for representing graphical objects and transmitting them to output devices such as monitors and printers gdi is responsible for tasks such as drawing lines and curves rendering fonts and handling palettes it is not directly responsible for drawing windows menus etc that task is reserved for the user subsystem which resides in user32 dll and is built atop gdi gdi is similar to macintosh s classic quickdraw perhaps the most significant capability of gdi over more direct methods of accessing the hardware is its scaling capabilities and abstraction of target devices using gdi it is very easy to draw on multiple devices such as a screen and a printer and expect proper reproduction in each case this capability is at the centre of all what you see is what you get applications for microsoft windows simple games which do not require fast graphics rendering use gdi however gdi cannot animate properly and lacks rasterization for 3d modern games tend to use directx or opengl which give programmers the capabilities to use features of modern hardware 
organic computing is a form of biologically inspired computing with organic properties it has emerged recently as a challenging vision for future information processing systems organic computing is based on the insight that we will soon be surrounded by large collections of autonomous systems which are equipped with sensors and actuators aware of their environment communicate freely and organise themselves in order to perform the actions and services that seem to be required the presence of networks of intelligent systems in our environment opens fascinating application areas but at the same time bears the problem of their controllability hence we have to construct such systems which we increasingly depend on as robust safe flexible and trustworthy as possible in particular a strong orientation towards human needs as opposed to a pure implementation of the technologically possible seems absolutely central in order to achieve these goals our technical systems will have to act more independently flexibly and autonomously i e they will have to exhibit life like properties we call those systems organic hence an organic computing system is a technical system which adapts dynamically to the current conditions of its environment it is characterised by the self x properties the vision of organic computing and its fundamental concepts arose independently in different research areas like neuroscience molecular biology and computer engineering self organising systems have been studied for quite some time by mathematicians sociologists physicists economists and computer scientists but so far almost exclusively based on strongly simplified artificial models central aspects of organic computing systems have been and will be inspired by an analysis of information processing in biological systems 
the aho corasick algorithm is a string searching algorithm created by alfred v aho and margaret j corasick it is a kind of dictionary matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings within an input text it matches all patterns at once so the complexity of the algorithm is linear in the length of the patterns plus the length of the searched text plus the number of output matches note that because all matches are found there can be a quadratic number of matches if every substring matches informally the algorithm constructs a trie with suffix tree like set of links from each node representing a string to the node corresponding to the longest proper suffix it also contains links from each node to the longest suffix node that corresponds to a dictionary entry thus all of the matches may be enumerated by following the resulting linked list it then uses the trie at runtime moving along the input and keeping the longest match using the suffix links to make sure that computation is linear for every node that is in the dictionary and every link along the dictionary suffix linked list an output is generated when the pattern dictionary is known in advance the construction of the automaton can be performed once off line and the compiled automaton stored for later use in this case its run time is linear in the length of the input plus the number of matched entries the aho corasick algorithm formed the basis of the original unix command fgrep the following is the aho corasick data structure constructed from the specified dictionary with each row in the table representing a node in the trie with the column path indicating the sequence of characters from the root to the node at each step the current node is extended by finding its daughter and if that doesn t exist finding its suffix s daughter and if that doesn t work finding its suffix s suffix s daughter finally ending in the root node if nothing s seen before execution on input string abccab yields the following steps in general more than one dictionary suffix link may need to be followed as more than one dictionary entry may end at a given character in the input

in object oriented programming languages a mixin is a class that provides a certain functionality to be inherited by a subclass but is not meant to stand alone inheriting from a mixin is not a form of specialization but is rather a means to collect functionality a class may inherit most or all of its functionality by inheriting from one or more mixins through multiple inheritance mixins first appeared in the symbolics object oriented flavors system which was an approach to object orientation used in lisp machine lisp the name was inspired by steve s ice cream parlor in somerville massachusetts the ice cream shop owner offered a basic flavor of ice cream and blended in a combination of extra items and called the item a mix in his own trademarked term at the time mixins encourage code reuse and avoid well known pathologies associated with multiple inheritance however mixins introduce their own set of compromises a mixin can also be viewed as an interface with implemented methods when a class includes a mixin the class implements the interface and includes rather than inherits all the mixin s attributes and methods they become part of the class during compilation interestingly enough mixins don t need to implement an interface the advantage of implementing an interface is that instances of the class may be passed as parameters to methods requiring that interface a mixin can defer definition and binding of methods until runtime though attributes and instantiation parameters are still defined at compile time this differs from the most widely used approach which originated in the programming language simula of defining all attributes methods and initialization at compile time 
turtle graphics is a term in computer graphics for a method of programming vector graphics using a relative cursor upon a cartesian plane turtle graphics is a key feature of the logo programming language 
denormalization is the process of attempting to optimize the performance of a database by adding redundant data or by grouping data in some cases denormalization helps cover up the inefficiencies inherent in relational database software a relational normalized database imposes a heavy access load over physical storage of data even if it is well tuned for high performance a normalized design will often store different but related pieces of information in separate logical tables if these relations are stored physically as separate disk files completing a database query that draws information from several relations can be slow if many relations are joined it may be prohibitively slow there are two strategies for dealing with this the preferred method is to keep the logical design normalized but allow the dbms to store additional redundant information on disk to optimize query response in this case it is the dbms software s responsibility to ensure that any redundant copies are kept consistent this method is often implemented in sql as indexed views or materialized views a view represents information in a format convenient for querying and the index ensures that queries against the view are optimized the more usual approach is to denormalize the logical data design with care this can achieve a similar improvement in query response but at a cost it is now the database designer s responsibility to ensure that the denormalized database does not become inconsistent this is done by creating rules in the database called constraints that specify how the redundant copies of information must be kept synchronized it is the increase in logical complexity of the database design and the added complexity of the additional constraints that make this approach hazardous moreover constraints introduce a trade off speeding up reads while slowing down writes this means a denormalized database under heavy write load may actually offer worse performance than its functionally equivalent normalized counterpart a denormalized data model is not the same as a data model that has not been normalized and denormalization should only take place after a satisfactory level of normalization has taken place and that any required constraints and or rules have been created to deal with the inherent anomalies in the design for example all the relations are in third normal form and any relations with join and multi valued dependencies are handled appropriately examples of a denormalization techniques include 
a real time operating system is a multitasking operating system intended for real time applications such applications include embedded systems industrial robots spacecraft industrial control and scientific research equipment a rtos facilitates the creation of a real time system but does not guarantee the final result will be real time this requires correct development of the software an rtos does not necessarily have high throughput rather an rtos provides facilities which if used properly guarantee deadlines can be met generally or deterministically an rtos will typically use specialized scheduling algorithms in order to provide the real time developer with the tools necessary to produce deterministic behavior in the final system an rtos is valued more for how quickly and or predictably it can respond to a particular event than for the amount of work it can perform over a given period of time key factors in an rtos are therefore a minimal interrupt latency and a minimal thread switching latency an early example of a large scale real time operating system was transaction processing facility developed by american airlines and ibm for the sabre airline reservations system 
subversion is a version control system initiated in 2000 by collabnet inc it is used to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code web pages and documentation its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to the widely used concurrent versions system subversion is well known in the open source community and is used on many open source projects including apache software foundation kde gnome free pascal freebsd gcc python django ruby mono sourceforge net extjs and tigris org google code also provides subversion hosting for their open source projects bountysource systems use it exclusively codeplex offers access to both subversion as well as other types of clients subversion is also being adopted in the corporate world in a 2007 report by forrester research subversion was recognized as the sole leader in the standalone software configuration management category and a strong performer in the software configuration and change management category subversion is released under the apache license making it free software 
in computing an abstract data type is a specification of a set of data and the set of operations that can be performed on the data such a data type is abstract in the sense that it is independent of various concrete implementations the definition can be mathematical or it can be programmed as an interface a first class adt supports the creation of multiple instances of the adt and the interface normally provides a constructor which returns an abstract handle to new data and several operations which are functions accepting the abstract handle as an argument the main contribution of the abstract data type theory is that it formalizes a definition of type on the basis of the information hiding principle and in a way that such formalization can be explicitly represented in programming language notations and semantics this important advance in computer science theory led to the emergence of languages and methodological principles of object oriented programming 
isam stands for indexed sequential access method a method for indexing data for fast retrieval isam was originally developed by ibm for mainframe computers today the term is used for several related concepts in an isam system data is organized into records which are composed of fixed length fields records are stored sequentially originally to speed access on a tape system a secondary set of hash tables known as indexes contain pointers into the tables allowing individual records to be retrieved without having to search the entire data set this is a departure from the contemporary navigational databases in which the pointers to other data were stored inside the records themselves the key improvement in isam is that the indexes are small and can be searched quickly thereby allowing the database to access only the records it needs additionally modifications to the data do not require changes to other data only the table and indexes in question relational databases can easily be built on an isam framework with the addition of logic to maintain the validity of the links between the tables typically the field being used as the link the foreign key will be indexed for quick lookup while this is slower than simply storing the pointer to the related data directly in the records it also means that changes to the physical layout of the data do not require any updating of the pointers the entry will still be valid isam is very simple to understand and implement as it primarily consists of direct sequential access to a database file it is also very inexpensive the tradeoff is that each client machine must manage its own connection to each file it accesses this in turn leads to the possibility of conflicting inserts into those files leading to an inconsistent database state this is typically solved with the addition of a client server framework which marshals client requests and maintains ordering this is the basic concept behind a dbms which is a client layer over the underlying data store isam was replaced at ibm with a methodology called vsam still later ibm developed db2 which as of 2004 ibm promotes as their primary database management system vsam is the physical access method used in db2 the openvms operating system uses the files 11 file system in conjunction with rms rms provides an additional layer between the application and the files on disk that provides a consistent method of data organization and access across multiple 3gl and 4gl languages rms provides 4 different methods of accessing data sequential relative record number access record file address access and indexed access the indexed access method or reading or writing data only provided the desired outcome if in fact the file is organized as an isam file with the appropriate previously defined keys access to data via the previously defined key is extremely fast multiple keys overlapping keys and key compression within the hash tables are supported a utility to define redefine keys in existing files is provided records can be deleted although garbage collection is done via a separate utility

in computer science in particular networking a session is a semi permanent interactive information exchange also known as a dialogue a conversation or a meeting between two or more communicating devices or between a computer and user a session is set up or established at a certain point in time and torn down at a later point in time an established communication session may involve more than one message in each direction a session is typically but not always stateful meaning that at least one of the communicating parts needs to save information about the session history in order to be able to communicate as opposed to stateless communication where the communication consists of independent requests with responses communication sessions may be implemented as part of protocols and services at the application layer at the session layer or at the transport layer in the osi model in the case of transport protocols which do not implement a formal session layer or where sessions at the session layer are generally very short lived sessions are maintained by a higher level program using a method defined in the data being exchanged for example an http exchange between a browser and a remote host may include an http cookie which identifies state such as a unique session id information about the user s preferences or authorization level protocol version http 1 1 makes it possible to reuse the same tcp session for a sequence of service requests and responses in view to reduce the session establishment time while http 1 0 only allows a single request and response during one tcp session however this transport layer session mechanism should not be confused with a so called http session since it is not lasting sufficiently long time and does not provide application level interactive services such as dynamic web pages 
brownian motion is the seemingly random movement of particles suspended in a fluid or the mathematical model used to describe such random movements often called a particle theory the mathematical model of brownian motion has several real world applications an often quoted example is stock market fluctuations brownian motion is among the simplest of the continuous time stochastic processes and it is a limit of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes this universality is closely related to the universality of the normal distribution in both cases it is often mathematical convenience rather than the accuracy of the models that motivates their use 
in cryptography and computer science hash trees or merkle trees are a type of data structure which contains a tree of summary information about a larger piece of data for instance a file used to verify its contents hash trees are an extension of hash lists which in turn is an extension of hashing hash trees where the underlying hash function is tiger are often called tiger trees or tiger tree hashes

maven is a software tool for java project management and build automation created by sonatype s jason van zyl in 2002 it is similar in functionality to the apache ant tool but has a simpler build configuration model based on an xml format maven is hosted by the apache software foundation where it was formerly part of the jakarta project maven uses a construct known as a project object model to describe the software project being built its dependencies on other external modules and components and the build order it comes with pre defined targets for performing certain well defined tasks such as compilation of code and its packaging a key feature of maven is that it is network ready the core engine can dynamically download plug ins from a repository the same repository that provides access to many versions of different open source java projects from apache and other organizations and developers this repository and its reorganized successor the maven 2 repository strives to be the de facto distribution mechanism for java applications but its adoption has been slow maven provides built in support not just for retrieving files from this repository but to upload artifacts at the end of the build a local cache of downloaded artifacts acts as the primary means of synchronizing the output of projects on a local system maven is built using a plugin based architecture that allows it to make use of any application controllable through standard input theoretically this would allow anyone to write plugins to interface with build tools for any other language in reality support and use for languages other than java has been minimal currently a plugin for the net framework exists and is maintained and a c c native plugin was at one time maintained for maven 1 
bencode is the encoding used by the peer to peer file sharing system bittorrent for storing and transmitting loosely structured data it supports four different types of values bencoding is most commonly used in torrent files these metadata files are simply bencoded dictionaries while less efficient than a pure binary encoding bencoding is simple and is unaffected by endianness which is important for a cross platform application like bittorrent it is also fairly flexible as long as applications ignore unexpected dictionary keys so that new ones can be added without creating incompatibilities 
in information retrieval question answering is the task of automatically answering a question posed in natural language to find the answer to a question a qa computer program may use either a pre structured database or a collection of natural language documents qa research attempts to deal with a wide range of question types including fact list definition how why hypothetical semantically constrained and cross lingual questions search collections vary from small local document collections to internal organization documents to compiled newswire reports to the world wide web qa is regarded as requiring more complex natural language processing techniques than other types of information retrieval such as document retrieval thus natural language search engines are sometimes regarded as the next step beyond current search engines 
donkey often known by its file name donkey bas was a computer game written in 1981 and included with early versions of the pc dos operating system distributed with the original ibm pc it is a driving game in which the player must avoid hitting donkeys while extremely simple compared to later pc games and to games available for other systems at the time of its release donkey bas is arguably a predecessor of all ibm pc games the game is also notable because it was co written by microsoft co founder bill gates

a ping of death is a type of attack on a computer that involves sending a malformed or otherwise malicious ping to a computer a ping is normally 56 bytes in size historically many computer systems could not handle a ping packet larger than the maximum ip packet size which is 65 535 bytes sending a ping of this size could crash the target computer traditionally this bug has been relatively easy to exploit generally sending a 65 536 byte ping packet is illegal according to networking protocol but a packet of such a size can be sent if it is fragmented when the target computer reassembles the packet a buffer overflow can occur which often causes a system crash this exploit has affected a wide variety of systems including unix linux mac windows printers and routers however most systems since 1997 1998 have been fixed so this bug is mostly historical in recent years a different kind of ping attack has become wide spread ping flooding simply floods the victim with so much ping traffic that normal traffic fails to reach the system 
in concurrent programming a monitor is an object intended to be used safely by more than one thread the defining characteristic of a monitor is that its methods are executed with mutual exclusion that is at each point in time at most one thread may be executing any of its methods this mutual exclusion greatly simplifies reasoning about the implementation of monitors compared with code that may be executed in parallel monitors also provide a mechanism for threads to temporarily give up exclusive access in order to wait for some condition to be met before regaining exclusive access and resuming their task monitors also have a mechanism for signaling other threads that such conditions have been met monitors were invented by c a r hoare and per brinch hansen and were first implemented in brinch hansen s concurrent pascal language 
in software engineering concurrency patterns are those types of design patterns that deal with multi threaded programming paradigm examples of this class of patterns include

interface generally refers to an abstraction that an entity provides of itself to the outside this separates the methods of external communication from internal operation and allows it to be internally modified without affecting the way outside entities interact with it as well as provide multiple abstractions of itself it may also provide a means of translation between entities which do not speak the same language such as between a human and a computer because interfaces are a form of indirection some additional overhead is incurred versus direct communication the interface between a human and a computer is called a user interface interfaces between hardware components are physical interfaces this article deals with software interfaces which exist between separate software components and provide a programmatic mechanism by which these components can communicate 
the linux standard base or lsb is a joint project by several linux distributions under the organizational structure of the linux foundation to standardize the software system structure or filesystem hierarchy used with linux based operating systems the lsb is based on the posix specification the single unix specification and several other open standards but extends them in certain areas according to the lsb the lsb compliance may be certified for a product by a certification procedure the lsb specifies for example standard libraries a number of commands and utilities that extend the posix standard the layout of the file system hierarchy run levels the printing system including spoolers such as cups and tools like foomatic and several extensions to the x window system 
paper prototyping is a widely used method in the user centered design process a process that helps developers to create software that meets the user s expectations and needs in this case especially for designing and testing user interfaces it is throwaway prototyping and involves creating rough even hand sketched drawings of an interface to use as prototypes or models of a design while paper prototyping seems simple this method of usability testing can provide a great deal of useful feedback which will result in the design of better products this is supported by many usability professionals 
an olap cube is a data structure that allows fast analysis of data the arrangement of data into cubes overcomes a limitation of relational databases relational databases are not well suited for near instantaneous analysis and display of large amounts of data instead they are better suited for creating records from a series of transactions known as oltp or on line transaction processing although many report writing tools exist for relational databases these are slow when the whole database must be summarized 
http cookies are small pieces of text stored by a user s web browser that contain the user s settings shopping cart contents or other data used by websites they are transmitted as parcels of text sent by a server to a web client and then sent back unchanged by client each time it accesses that server http cookies are used for authenticating session tracking and maintaining specific information about users such as site preferences or the contents of their electronic shopping carts the term cookie is derived from magic cookie a well known concept in unix computing which inspired both the idea and the name of http cookies some alternatives to cookies exist but each has its own uses advantages and drawbacks cookies are also subject to a number of misconceptions mostly based on the erroneous notion that they are computer programs that run on the browsing computer in fact cookies are simple pieces of data that affect the operation of a web server not the client and do so in very specific ways in particular they are neither spyware nor viruses although cookies from certain sites are described as spyware by many anti spyware products because they allow users to be tracked when they visit various sites most modern browsers allow users to decide whether to accept cookies but rejection makes some websites unusable for example shopping carts implemented using cookies do not work if cookies are rejected 
a splay tree is a self balancing binary search tree with the additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access again it performs basic operations such as insertion look up and removal in o amortized time for many non uniform sequences of operations splay trees perform better than other search trees even when the specific pattern of the sequence is unknown the splay tree was invented by daniel sleator and robert tarjan all normal operations on a binary search tree are combined with one basic operation called splaying splaying the tree for a certain element rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree one way to do this is to first perform a standard binary tree search for the element in question and then use tree rotations in a specific fashion to bring the element to the top alternatively a top down algorithm can combine the search and the tree reorganization into a single phase

a box muller transform is a method of generating pairs of independent standard normally distributed random numbers given a source of uniformly distributed random numbers it is commonly expressed in two forms the basic form as given by box and muller takes two samples from the uniform distribution on the interval and maps them to two normally distributed samples the polar form takes two samples from a different interval and maps them to two normally distributed samples without the use of sine or cosine functions one could use the inverse transform sampling method to generate normally distributed random numbers instead the box muller transform was developed to be more computationally efficient the more efficient ziggurat algorithm can also be used 
in computer science declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow it attempts to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program should accomplish rather than describing how to go about accomplishing it this is in contrast from imperative programming which requires a detailed description of the algorithm to be run declarative programming consider programs as theories of a formal logic and computations as deductions in that logic space declarative programming has become of particular interest recently as it may greatly simplify writing parallel programs common declarative languages include those of regular expressions logic programming and functional programming 
within the type system of a programming language an operator from types to types is covariant if it preserves the ordering  of types which orders types from more specific ones to more generic ones it is contravariant if it reverses this ordering if neither of these apply the operator is invariant these terms come from category theory which has a general definition of covariance and contravariance that unifies the computer science definition of these terms with the definition used in vector spaces this distinction is important in considering argument and return types of methods in class hierarchies in object oriented languages such as c if class b is a subtype of class a then all member functions of b must return the same or narrower set of types as a the return type is said to be covariant on the other hand the member functions of b must take the same or broader set of arguments compared with the member functions of a the argument type is said to be contravariant the problem for instances of b is how to be perfectly substitutable for instances of a the only way to guarantee type safety and substitutability is to be equally or more liberal than a on inputs and to be equally or more strict than a on outputs note that not all programming languages guarantee both properties in every context and that some are unnecessarily strict they are said not to support covariance or contravariance in a given context the behavior of some programming languages is discussed below typical examples in object oriented programming substitution is also implicitly invoked by overriding methods in subclasses the new method can be used where the old method was invoked in the original code programming languages vary widely on their allowed forms of overriding and on the variance of overridden methods types 
in computer science a suffix tree is a data structure that presents the suffixes of a given string in a way that allows for a particularly fast implementation of many important string operations the suffix tree for a string s is a tree whose edges are labeled with strings and such that each suffix of s corresponds to exactly one path from the tree s root to a leaf it is thus a radix tree for the suffixes of s constructing such a tree for the string s takes time and space linear in the length of s once constructed several operations can be performed quickly for instance locating a substring in s locating a substring if a certain number of mistakes are allowed locating matches for a regular expression pattern etc suffix trees also provided one of the first linear time solutions for the longest common substring problem these speedups come at a cost storing a string s suffix tree typically requires significantly more space than storing the string itself 
xforms is an xml format for the specification of a data processing model for xml data and user interface for the xml data such as web forms xforms was designed to be the next generation of html xhtml forms but is generic enough that it can also be used in a standalone manner or with presentation languages other than xhtml to describe a user interface and a set of common data manipulation tasks xforms much like xhtml 2 0 which is currently under development as of 2008 and within which xforms will be embedded differs from previous versions of xhtml xforms 1 0 was published on 29 october 2007 the original xforms specification was made an official w3c recommendation on 14 october 2003 xforms 1 1 which introduces a number of improvements reached the status of w3c candidate recommendation on 29 november 2007 
in computing internationalization and localization are means of adapting computer software to different languages and regional differences internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes localization is the process of adapting software for a specific region or language by adding locale specific components and translating text due to their length the terms are frequently abbreviated to the numeronyms i18n and l10n respectively the capital l on l10n helps to distinguish it from the lowercase i in i18n some companies like microsoft and ibm use the term globalization for the combination of internationalization and localization globalization can also be abbreviated to g11n this term is also known as native language support or nls

in computing and programming a continuation is an abstract representation of the control state or the rest of computation or rest of code to be executed this is closely linked with what part of the program you are in which function and which line is being executed the current continuation or continuation of the computation step are the instructions that will be executed after the current line of code is executed the term continuations can also be used to refer to first class continuations which are constructs that give a programming language the ability to save the execution state at any point and return to that point at a later point in the program programs must allocate space in memory for the variables its functions use most programming languages use a call stack for storing the variables needed because it allows for fast and simple allocating and automatic deallocation of memory there are also programming languages that use a heap for this which allows for flexibility but with a higher cost for allocating and deallocating memory these two different implementations both have benefits and drawbacks in the context of continuations almost all languages have a means for manipulating the order of execution steps the goto is the most basic form of this control structures like if statements loops return statements break statements and exit are more structured ways to manipulate the order of executing instructions and are essentially limited goto statements more complex constructs exist as well for example in c setjmp can be used to jump from the middle of one function to another function provided the second function is lower on the stack other more complex examples include coroutines in simula 67 tasklets in stackless python generators in icon and python fibers in ruby the backtracking mechanism in prolog and threads

an ll parser is a top down parser for a subset of the context free grammars it parses the input from left to right and constructs a leftmost derivation of the sentence the class of grammars which are parsable in this way is known as the ll grammars the remainder of this article describes the table based kind of parser the alternative being a recursive descent parser which is usually coded by hand recursive descent parser generator an ll parser is called an ll parser if it uses k tokens of lookahead when parsing a sentence if such a parser exists for a certain grammar and it can parse sentences of this grammar without backtracking then it is called an ll grammar of these grammars ll grammars although fairly restrictive are very popular because the corresponding ll parsers only need to look at the next token to make their parsing decisions languages based on grammars with a high value of k require considerable effort to parse there is contention between the european school of language design who prefer ll based grammars and the us school who predominantly prefer lr based grammars this is largely due to teaching traditions and the detailed description of specific methods and tools in certain text books another influence may be niklaus wirth at eth zÃ¼rich in switzerland whose research has described a number of ways of optimising ll languages and compilers 
kriging is a group of geostatistical techniques to interpolate the value of a random field at an unobserved location from observations of its value at nearby locations the theory behind interpolation and extrapolation by kriging was developed by the french mathematician georges matheron based on the master s thesis of daniel gerhardus krige the pioneering plotter of distance weighted average gold grades at the witwatersrand reef complex in south africa the english verb is to krige and the most common noun is kriging 
architectural patterns are software patterns that offer well established solutions to architectural problems in software engineering it gives description of the elements and relation type together with a set of constraints on how they may be used an architectural pattern expresses a fundamental structural organization schema for a software system which consists of subsystems their responsibilities and interrelations in comparison to design patterns architectural patterns are larger in scale even though an architectural pattern conveys an image of a system it is not an architecture as such an architectural pattern is rather a concept that captures essential elements of a software architecture countless different architectures may implement the same pattern and thereby share the same characteristics furthermore patterns are often defined as something strictly described and commonly available for example layered architecture is a call and return style when it defines an overall style to interact when it is strictly described and commonly available it is a pattern one of the most important aspects of architectural patterns is that they embody different quality attributes for example some patterns represent solutions to performance problems and others can be used successfully in high availability systems in the early design phase a software architect makes a choice of which architectural pattern best provide the system s desired qualities examples of architectural patterns include the following 
an object relational database or object relational database management system is a database management system similar to a relational database but with an object oriented database model objects classes and inheritance are directly supported in database schemas and in the query language in addition it supports extension of the data model with custom data types and methods an object relational database can be said to provide a middle ground between relational databases and object oriented databases in object relational databases the approach is essentially that of relational databases the data resides in the database and is manipulated collectively with queries in a query language at the other extreme are oodbmses in which the database is essentially a persistent object store for software written in an object oriented programming language with a programming api for storing and retrieving objects and little or no specific support for querying 
graphical computer applications with a multiple document interface are those whose windows reside under a single parent window as opposed to all windows being separate from each other the initialism mdi is usually not expanded in the usability community there has been much debate over which interface type is preferable generally sdi is seen as more useful in cases where users work with more than one application companies have used both interfaces with mixed responses for example microsoft has changed its office applications from sdi to mdi mode and then back to sdi although the degree of implementation varies from one component to another the disadvantage of mdi usually cited is the lack of information about the currently opened windows in order to view a list of windows open in mdi applications the user typically has to select a specific menu if this option is available at all with an sdi application the window manager s task bar or task manager displays the currently opened windows in recent years applications have increasingly added task bars and tabs to show the currently opened windows in an mdi application which has made this criticism somewhat obsolete some people use a different name for this interface tabbed document interface when tabs are used to manage windows individual ones usually cannot be resized nearly all graphical user interface toolkits to date provide at least one solution for designing mdis the java gui toolkit swing for instance provides the class javax swing jdesktoppane which serves as a container for individual frames gtk lacks any standardized support for mdi 
structure and interpretation of computer programs is a textbook published in 1985 about general computer programming concepts from mit press written by massachusetts institute of technology professors harold abelson and gerald jay sussman with julie sussman it was used as the textbook of mit s old introductory programming class 6 001 and at other schools the second edition appeared in 1996 widely considered a classic text in computer science it is also known as the wizard book and less commonly the purple book using a dialect of the lisp programming language known as scheme the book explains core computer science concepts including abstraction recursion interpreters and metalinguistic abstraction the program also introduces a practical implementation of the register machine concept defining and developing an assembler for such a construct which is used as a virtual machine for the implementation of interpreters and compilers in the book and as a testbed for illustrating the implementation and effect of modifications to the evaluation mechanism working scheme systems based on the design described in this book are quite common student projects 
in computer programming a callback is executable code that is passed as an argument to other code it allows a lower level software layer to call a subroutine defined in a higher level layer however while technically accurate this might not be the most illustrative explanation think of it as a in case of fire break glass subroutine many computer programs tend to be written such that they expect a certain set of possibilities at any given moment if thing that was expected then do something otherwise do something else is a common theme however there are many situations in which events could happen at any time rather than checking for them at each possible step it is easier to have a system which detects a number of events and will call the appropriate function upon said event instead a callback routine is a sort of insurance policy if zombies attack call this function if the user moves their mouse over an icon call highlighticon and so forth usually there is a framework in which a series of events in which the running framework will call a registered chunk of code based on some pre registered function the events may be anything from user input network activity or an internal operating system event the concept is to develop a piece of code that can be registered within some framework that will serve as the handler upon the condition stated at registration how the flow of control is passed between the underlying framework and the registered callback function is specific to the framework itself 
swig is an open source software tool used to connect programs or libraries written in c c with scripting languages such as tcl perl python ruby php lua r and other languages like java c scheme and ocaml output can also be in the form of xml or lisp s expressions 
in computer science the schwartzian transform is a perl programming idiom used to improve the efficiency of sorting a list of items this idiom is appropriate for comparison based sorting when comparing a pair of elements is a compute intensive operation that should be performed a minimal number of times the schwartzian transform is notable in that it does not use named temporary arrays the idiom is named after randal l schwartz who first demonstrated it in perl shortly after the release of perl 5 in 1994 the term schwartzian transform applied solely to perl programming for a number of years but it has later been adopted by some users of other languages such as python to refer to similar idioms in those languages it should be noted however that the algorithm was already in use in other languages before it was popularized among the perl community in the form of that particular idiom by schwartz the term schwartzian transform indicates a specific idiom and not the algorithm in general the schwartzian transform is a version of a lisp idiom known as decorate sort undecorate which avoids recomputing the sort keys by temporarily associating them with the input items this approach is similar to memoization which avoids repeating the calculation of the key corresponding to a specific input value by comparison this idiom assures that each input item s key is calculated exactly once which may still result in repeating some calculations if the input data contains duplicate items and in the 1960s sort generators own coding features facilitated similar input output transformations for ease of comparing records 
data analysis visualizationsmoothed particle hydrodynamicsmolecular dynamicsmonte carlo methods are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results monte carlo methods are often used when simulating physical and mathematical systems because of their reliance on repeated computation and random or pseudo random numbers monte carlo methods are most suited to calculation by a computer monte carlo methods tend to be used when it is infeasible or impossible to compute an exact result with a deterministic algorithm monte carlo simulation methods are especially useful in studying systems with a large number of coupled degrees of freedom such as fluids disordered materials strongly coupled solids and cellular structures more broadly monte carlo methods are useful for modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business these methods are also widely used in mathematics a classic use is for the evaluation of definite integrals particularly multidimensional integrals with complicated boundary conditions the term monte carlo method was coined in the 1940s by physicists working on nuclear weapon projects in the los alamos national laboratory

dynamic html or dhtml is a collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated web sites by using a combination of a static markup language a client side scripting language a presentation definition language and the document object model dhtml allows scripting languages to change variables in a web page s definition language which in turn affects the look and function of otherwise static html page content after the page has been fully loaded and during the viewing process thus the dynamic characteristic of dhtml is the way it functions while a page is viewed not in its ability to generate a unique page with each page load by contrast a dynamic web page is a broader concept any web page generated differently for each user load occurrence or specific variable values this includes pages created by client side scripting and ones created by server side scripting where the web server generates content before sending it to the client 
test driven development is a software development technique that uses short development iterations based on pre written test cases that define desired improvements or new functions each iteration produces code necessary to pass that iteration s tests finally the programmer or team refactors the code to accommodate changes a key tdd concept is that preparing tests before coding facilitates rapid feedback changes note that test driven development is a software design method not merely a method of testing test driven development is related to the test first programming concepts of extreme programming begun in 1999 but more recently is creating more general interest in its own right programmers also apply the concept to improving and debugging legacy code developed with older techniques 
r trees are tree data structures that are similar to b trees but are used for spatial access methods i e for indexing multi dimensional information for example the coordinates of geographical data a common real world usage for an r tree might be find all museums within 2Â miles of my current location the data structure splits space with hierarchically nested and possibly overlapping minimum bounding rectangles each node of an r tree has a variable number of entries each entry within a non leaf node stores two pieces of data a way of identifying a child node and the bounding box of all entries within this child node the insertion and deletion algorithms use the bounding boxes from the nodes to ensure that nearby elements are placed in the same leaf node each entry within a leaf node stores two pieces of information a way of identifying the actual data element and the bounding box of the data element similarly the searching algorithms use the bounding boxes to decide whether or not to search inside a child node in this way most of the nodes in the tree are never touched during a search like b trees this makes r trees suitable for databases where nodes can be paged to memory when needed different algorithms can be used to split nodes when they become too full resulting in the quadratic and linear r tree sub types r trees do not historically guarantee good worst case performance but generally perform well with real world data however a new algorithm was published in 2004 that defines the priority r tree which claims to be as efficient as the currently most efficient methods and is at the same time worst case optimal 
in common usage a hacker is a person who breaks into computers the subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the computer underground proponents claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends but are often unconcerned about the use of criminal means to achieve them other uses of the word hacker exist that are not related to computer security but these are rarely used by the mainstream media

gall s law is a rule of thumb from john gall s systemantics how systems really work and how they fail systemantics is a commentary on systems theory and general semantics publications by such thinkers as ludwig von bertalanffy and alfred korzybski although dubbed gall s law by some the actual quote is not labeled as such in the original work the work cites murphy s law and the peter principle and is filled with similar sayings although the quote may seem to validate the merits of simple systems it is preceded by the qualifier a simple system may or may not work this philosophy can also be attributed to extreme programming which encourages doing the simplest thing first and adding functionality later 
telemetry is a technology that allows the remote measurement and reporting of information of interest to the system designer or operator the word is derived from greek roots tele remote and metron measure systems that need instructions and data sent to them in order to operate require the counterpart of telemetry telecommand 
a binary heap is a heap data structure created using a binary tree it can be seen as a binary tree with two additional constraints greater than means according to whatever comparison function is chosen to sort the heap not necessarily greater than in the mathematical sense heaps where the comparison function is mathematical greater than are called max heaps those where the comparison function is mathematical less than are called min heaps conventionally min heaps are used since they are readily applicable for use in priority queues note that the ordering of siblings in a heap is not specified by the heap property so the two children of a parent can be freely interchanged the binary heap is a special case of the d ary heap in which each node can have d children it is possible to modify the heap structure to allow extraction of both the smallest and largest element in o time to do this the rows alternate between min heap and max heap the algorithms are roughly the same but in each step must consider the alternating rows with alternating comparisons the performance is roughly the same as a normal single direction heap this idea can be generalised to a min max median heap

in computing a first class object in the context of a particular programming language is an entity which can be used in programs without restriction in computer science the term reification is used when referring to the process of making something a first class object the term was coined by christopher strachey in the context of functions as first class citizens in the mid 1960s 
depending on the language this can imply for example in c and c it is not possible to create new functions at runtime whereas other kinds of objects can be created at runtime as a result functions in c are not first class objects instead they are sometimes called second class objects because they can still be manipulated in most of the above fashions similarly strings are not first class objects in fortran 66 because it is not possible to assign them to variables in smalltalk functions are first class objects just like smalltalk classes since smalltalk operators are methods they are also objects in virtually all languages values of the simplest data types including integers and floating point numbers are first class objects in many older languages arrays were not first class they could not be assigned as objects only their elements could be directly manipulated few languages support continuations and goto labels as first class objects though arguably they don t support them as objects at all closures were previously also rarely supported as first class values although this is common in recent languages

 0 41Â  c 150 2Â  c hydrogen peroxide is a very pale blue liquid which appears colorless in a dilute solution slightly more viscous than water it is a weak acid it has strong oxidizing properties and is therefore a powerful bleaching agent that is mostly used for bleaching paper but has also found use as a disinfectant as an oxidizer as an antiseptic and in rocketry as a monopropellant and in bipropellant systems the oxidizing capacity of hydrogen peroxide is so strong that the chemical is considered a highly reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced as a byproduct of oxygen metabolism and virtually all organisms possess enzymes known as peroxidases which harmlessly and catalytically decompose low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen 
a primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime amongst other fields of mathematics it is used for cryptography the difference between this and integer factorization is that a primality test doesn t necessarily give prime factors while integer factorization does as of 2009 factorization is a computationally hard problem whereas primality testing is comparatively easy some primality tests prove that a number is prime while others prove that a number is composite therefore we might call the latter compositeness tests instead of primality tests 
a postscript abbreviated p s is writing added after the main body of a letter the term comes from the latin post scriptum an expression meaning after writing a postscript may be a sentence a paragraph or occasionally many paragraphs added often hastily and incidentally after the signature of a letter or the main body of an essay or book in a book or essay a more carefully composed addition is called an afterword an afterword not usually called a postscript is written in response to critical remarks on the first edition the word has poetically been used to refer to any sort of addendum to some main work even if not attached to a main work as in sÃ¸ren kierkegaard s book titled concluding unscientific postscript 
template metaprogramming is a metaprogramming technique in which templates are used by a compiler to generate temporary source code which is merged by the compiler with the rest of the source code and then compiled the output of these templates include compile time constants data structures and complete functions the use of templates can be thought of as compile time execution the technique is used by a number of languages the most well known being c but also curl d eiffel haskell ml and xl

stream processing is a computer programming paradigm related to simd that allows some applications to more easily exploit a limited form of parallel processing such applications can use multiple computational units such as the floating point units on a gpu without explicitly managing allocation synchronization or communication among those units the stream processing paradigm simplifies parallel software and hardware by restricting the parallel computation that can be performed given a set of data a series of operations are applied to each element in the stream uniform streaming where one kernel function is applied to all elements in the stream is typical kernel functions are usually pipelined and local on chip memory is reused to minimize external memory bandwidth since the kernel and stream abstractions expose data dependencies compiler tools can fully automate and optimize on chip management tasks stream processing hardware can use scoreboarding for example to launch dmas at runtime when dependencies become known the elimination of manual dma management reduces software complexity and the elimination of hardware caches reduces the amount of die area not dedicated to computational units such as alus 
disk formatting is the process of preparing a hard disk or other storage medium for use including setting up an empty file system a variety of utilities and programs exist for this task pictured to the right is the iconic format com of ms dos and pc dos large disks can be partitioned that is divided into distinct sections that are formatted with their own file systems this is normally only done on hard disks because of the small sizes of other disk types as well as compatibility issues a corrupted operating system can be reverted to a clean state by formatting the disk and reinstalling the os as a drastic way of combating a software problem or malware infection obviously important files should be backed up beforehand 
cross site scripting is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allow code injection by malicious web users into the web pages viewed by other users examples of such code include html code and client side scripts an exploited cross site scripting vulnerability can be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same origin policy vulnerabilities of this kind have been exploited to craft powerful phishing attacks and browser exploits as of 2007 cross site scripting carried out on websites were roughly 80 of all documented security vulnerabilities often during an attack everything looks fine to the end user who may be subject to unauthorized access theft of sensitive data and financial loss 
in mathematics a directed acyclic graph also called a dag is a directed graph with no directed cycles that is for any vertex v there is no nonempty directed path that starts and ends on v informally speaking a dag flows in a single direction it thus can be used to model causality and implication the reachability relation in a dag forms a partial order and any finite partial order may be represented by a dag in this way dags may also be used to model processes in which information flows in a consistent direction through a network of processors and to provide space efficient data structures for representing sets of sequences 
in computing diff is a file comparison utility that outputs the differences between two files or the changes made to a current file by comparing it to a former version of the same file diff displays the changes made per line for text files modern implementations also support binary files the output is called a diff or a patch since the output can be applied with the unix program patch the output of similar file comparison utilities are also called a diff like the use of the word grep for describing the act of searching the word diff is used in jargon as a verb for calculating any difference 
microsoft windows services for unix or subsystem for unix based applications is a software package produced by microsoft which provides a unix subsystem and other parts of a full unix environment on windows nt and its successors the subsystem included is called interix like the microsoft posix subsystem in windows nt interix is not an emulation of a unix kernel but rather an implementation of a user mode subsystem running directly on top of the windows nt kernel though both cygwin and windows services for unix provide header files and libraries that make it easier to recompile or port unix applications for use on windows they do not make unix binaries compatible with windows binaries it is best thought of as a distinct unix like platform 
init is the program on unix and unix like systems that spawns all other processes it runs as a daemon and typically has pid 1 the functionality diverged in unixes such as system iii and system v from the functionality provided by the init in research unix and its bsd derivatives the usage on most linux distributions is compatible with system v but some distributions such as arch and slackware use a bsd style and others such as gentoo have their own customized version ubuntu and some other linux distros now use upstart as a replacement for the traditional init process

human interface guidelines are software development documents which offer application developers a set of recommendations their aim is to improve the experience for the users by making application interfaces more intuitive learnable and consistent most guides limit themselves to defining a common look and feel for applications in a particular desktop environment the guides enumerate specific policies policies are sometimes based on studies of human computer interaction but most are based on arbitrary conventions chosen by the platform developers human interface guidelines will dictate a set of rules for general usability they often describe the visual design rules including icon and window design and style frequently they specify how user input and interaction mechanisms work some describe the language style a hig will sometimes also define standard terminology and semantics related to certain elements or actions in general this is restricted to the semantics of the desktop environment or the file system as the majority of user problems come from the semantics of the applications this is a drawback to most higs the more important version of higs are those done for groups or applications in this case the hig will build on a platform hig by adding the common semantics for a range of functions the central aim of a hig is to create a consistent experience across the environment including the applications and other tools being used this means both applying the same visual design and creating consistent access to and behaviour of common elements of the interface from simple ones such as buttons and icons up to more complex constructions such as dialog boxes higs should be taken at face value their recommendations and advice are meant to help developers create better applications but developers are naturally free to break them if they think that the guidelines do not fit their application the only repercussion for doing so may be that the organisation publishing the hig does not give the application its blessing mozilla firefox s user interface for example goes against the gnome project s hig which is one of the main arguments for including epiphany instead of firefox in the gnome distribution but such departures should only be taken when there is evidence from usability testing that the interface is improved 

rom hacking is the process of modifying a video game rom image to alter the game s graphics dialogue levels gameplay or other gameplay elements this is usually done by technically inclined video game fans to breathe new life into a cherished old game as a creative outlet or to make essentially new unofficial games using an old game as a foundation rom hacking is generally accomplished through use of a hex editor and various specialized tools such as tile editors and game specific tools which are generally used for editing levels items and the like although more advanced tools such as assemblers and debuggers are occasionally used once ready they are usually distributed on the internet for others to play on an emulator fan translation is a type of rom hacking there are also anti censorship hacks that exist to restore a game to its original state which is often seen with older games that were imported as publishers content policies for video games were much stricter in the united states than japan or europe although much of the methodology applies to both types of hacking this article focuses on creative hacking such as editing game levels 
in software compiler engineering name mangling is a technique used to solve various problems caused by the need to resolve unique names for programming entities in many modern programming languages it provides a way of encoding additional information about the name of a function structure class or another datatype in order to pass more semantic information from the compilers to linkers the need arises where the language allows different entities to be named with the same identifier as long as they occupy a different namespace any object code produced by compilers is usually linked with other pieces of object code by a type of program called a linker the linker needs a great deal of information on each program entity for example to correctly link a function it needs its name the number of arguments and their types and so on

reverse polish notation by analogy with the related polish notation a prefix notation introduced in 1920 by the polish mathematician jan Åukasiewicz is a mathematical notation wherein every operator follows all of its operands it is also known as postfix notation and is parenthesis free the reverse polish scheme was proposed in 1954 by burks warren and wright and was independently reinvented by f l bauer and e w dijkstra in the early 1960s to reduce computer memory access and utilize the stack to evaluate expressions the notation and algorithms for this scheme were enriched by australian philosopher and computer scientist charles hamblin in the mid 1950s during the 1960s and 1970s rpn had some currency even among the general public as it was widely used in desktop calculators of the time most of what follows is about binary operators a unary operator for which the reverse polish notation is the general convention is the factorial 
in computing the modulo operation finds the remainder of division of one number by another given two numbers a and n a modulo n is the remainder on division of a by n for instance the expression 7 mod 3 would evaluate to 1 while 9 mod 3 would evaluate to 0 although typically performed with a and n both being integers many computing systems allow other types of numeric operands see modular arithmetic for an older and related convention applied in number theory 
utf 8 is a variable length character encoding for unicode it is able to represent any character in the unicode standard yet the initial encoding of byte codes and character assignments for utf 8 is backwards compatible with ascii for these reasons it is steadily becoming the preferred encoding for e mail web pages and other places where characters are stored or streamed utf 8 encodes each character in one to four octets with the 1 byte encoding used for the 128 us ascii characters see the description section below for details the internet engineering task force requires all internet protocols to identify the encoding used for character data and the supported character encodings must include utf 8 the internet mail consortium recommends that all email programs be able to display and create mail using utf 8 
http headers form the core of an http request and are very important in an http response they define various characteristics of the data that is requested or the data that has been provided the headers are separated from the request or response body by a blank line http headers can be near arbitrary strings but only some are commonly understood 
in the context of software engineering software quality measures how well software is designed and how well the software conforms to that design although there are several different definitions whereas quality of conformance is concerned with implementation quality of design measures how valid the design and requirements are in creating a worthwhile product 
this list of circulating currencies contains the 182 current official or de facto currencies of the 192 united nations member states 1 un observer state 4 partially recognized sovereign states 6 unrecognized countries and 32 dependencies the only dependencies and unrecognized countries listed here use a currency other than that of the sovereign state that administers them or has de jure jurisdiction over them currencies used in places of extraterritoriality like the united nations or the sovereign military order of malta and scrips used by private entities like the disney dollar and the ora are not under the purview of this list a currency is a unit of exchange and hence a kind of money and medium of exchange currency includes paper banknotes and metal coins countries generally have a monopoly on the issuing of currency although some countries share currencies with other countries today currencies are the dominant means of exchange different countries may use the same term to refer to their respective currencies even though the currencies may have little else to do with each other a place that is technically part of another country sometimes uses a different currency from that of the parent country

softice is a kernel mode debugger for microsoft windows crucially it is designed to run underneath windows such that the operating system is unaware of its presence unlike an application debugger softice is capable of suspending all operations in windows when instructed for driver debugging this is critical due to how hardware is accessed and the kernel of the operating system functions because of its low level capabilities softice is also popular as a software cracking tool microsoft offers two kernel mode debuggers windbg and kd for no charge however the full capabilities of windbg and kd are available only when two interlinked computers are used softice therefore is an exceptionally useful tool for difficult driver related development and continues to function well even with microsoft s latest operating system versions older versions exist for dos and compatible operating systems softice was originally produced by a company called numega and was subsequently acquired by compuware 
software testing is an empirical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test with respect to the context in which it is intended to operate this includes but is not limited to the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs it can also be stated as the process of validating and verifying that a software program application product meets the business and technical requirements that guided its design and development so that it works as expected and can be implemented with the same characteristics 
in object oriented programming the liskov substitution principle is a particular definition of subtype that was introduced by barbara liskov in a 1987 conference keynote address entitled data abstraction and hierarchy liskov formulated the principle succinctly in a subsequent paper as follows thus liskov s notion of subtype defines the notion of substitutability that is if s is a subtype of t then objects of type t in a program may be replaced with objects of type s without altering any of the desirable properties of that program 
plain old xml is a term used to describe basic xml sometimes mixed in with other blendable specifications like xml namespaces dublin core xinclude and xlink people typically use the term as a contrast with complicated multilayered xml specifications like those for web services or rdf the term may have been derived from or inspired by the expression plain old telephone service and similarly plain old java object an interesting question is how pox relates to xml schema on the one hand pox is completely compatible with xml schema however many pox users eschew xml schema to avoid the poor or inconsistent quality of xml schema to java tools pox is complementary to rest rest refers to a communication pattern while pox refers to an information format style the primary competitors to pox are more strictly defined xml based information formats such as rdf and soap section 5 encoding as well as general non xml information formats such as json and csv 
the simplified molecular input line entry specification or smiles is a specification for unambiguously describing the structure of chemical molecules using short ascii strings smiles strings can be imported by most molecule editors for conversion back into two dimensional drawings or three dimensional models of the molecules the original smiles specification was developed by arthur weininger and david weininger in the late 1980s it has since been modified and extended by others most notably by daylight chemical information systems inc in 2007 an open standard called opensmiles was developed by the blue obelisk open source chemistry community other linear notations include the wiswesser line notation rosdal and sln in august 2006 the iupac introduced the inchi as a standard for formula representation smiles is generally considered to have the advantage of being slightly more human readable than inchi it also has a wide base of software support with extensive theoretical backing 
richard matthew stallman often abbreviated rms is an american software freedom activist hacker and software developer in september 1983 he launched the gnu project to create a free unix like operating system and has been the project s lead architect and organizer with the launch of the gnu project he started the free software movement and in october 1985 set up the free software foundation stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft and is the main author of several copyleft licenses including the gnu general public license the most widely used free software license since the mid 1990s stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software as well as campaigning against both software patents and what he sees as excessive extension of copyright laws stallman has also developed a number of pieces of widely used software including the original emacs the gnu compiler collection and the gnu debugger he co founded the league for programming freedom in 1989 
in computer science cross cutting concerns are aspects of a program which affect other concerns these concerns often cannot be cleanly decomposed from the rest of the system in both the design and implementation and result in either scattering or tangling of the program or both for instance if writing an application for handling medical records the bookkeeping and indexing of such records is a core concern while logging a history of changes to the record database or user database or an authentication system would be cross cutting concerns since they touch more parts of the program 
in computability theory the halting problem is a decision problem which can be stated as follows given a description of a program and a finite input decide whether the program finishes running or will run forever given that input alan turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program input pairs cannot exist we say that the halting problem is undecidable over turing machines copeland attributes the actual term halting problem to martin davis 
an interface description language or idl for short is a specification language used to describe a software component s interface idls describe an interface in a language neutral way enabling communication between software components that do not share a language for example between components written in c and components written in java idls are commonly used in remote procedure call software in these cases the machines at either end of the link may be using different operating systems and computer languages idls offer a bridge between the two different systems software systems based on idls include sun s onc rpc the open group s distributed computing environment ibm s system object model the object management group s corba facebook s thrift and wsdl for web services

virtual memory is a computer system technique which gives an application program the impression that it has contiguous working memory while in fact it may be physically fragmented and may even overflow on to disk storage systems that use this technique make programming of large applications easier and use real physical memory more efficiently than those without virtual memory note that virtual memory is more than just using disk space to extend physical memory size that is merely the extension of the memory hierarchy to include hard disk drives extending memory to disk is a normal consequence of using virtual memory techniques but could be done by other means such as overlays or swapping programs and their data completely out to disk while they are inactive the definition of virtual memory is based on redefining the address space with a contiguous virtual memory addresses to trick programs into thinking they are using large blocks of contiguous addresses all modern general purpose computer operating systems use virtual memory techniques for ordinary applications such as word processors spreadsheets multimedia players accounting etc older operating systems such as dos and microsoft windows of the 1980s or those for the mainframes of the 1960s generally had no virtual memory functionality notable exceptions being the atlas b5000 and apple computer s lisa embedded systems and other special purpose computer systems which require very fast and or very consistent response times may choose not to use virtual memory due to decreased determinism

a random walk sometimes denoted rw is a mathematical formalization of a trajectory that consists of taking successive random steps the results of random walk analysis have been applied to computer science physics ecology economics and a number of other fields as a fundamental model for random processes in time for example the path traced by a molecule as it travels in a liquid or a gas the search path of a foraging animal the price of a fluctuating stock and the financial status of a gambler can all be modeled as random walks specific cases or limits of random walks include the drunkard s walk and lÃ©vy flight random walks are related to the diffusion models and are a fundamental topic in discussions of markov processes several properties of random walks including dispersal distributions first passage times and encounter rates have been extensively studied various different types of random walks are of interest often random walks are assumed to be markov but other more complicated walks are also of interest some random walks are on graphs others on the line in the plane or in higher dimensions while some random walks are on groups random walks also vary with regard to the time parameter often the walk is indexed by the natural numbers as in however some walks take their steps at random times and in that case the position xt is defined for 
nelder mead simplex search over the rosenbrock banana function and himmelblau s function the nelder mead method or downhill simplex method or amoeba method is a commonly used nonlinear optimization algorithm it is due to john nelder r mead and is a numerical method for minimizing an objective function in a many dimensional space 
consistent hashing is a scheme that provides hash table functionality in a way that the addition or removal of one slot does not significantly change the mapping of keys to slots in contrast in most traditional hash tables a change in the number of array slots causes nearly all keys to be remapped by using consistent hashing only k n keys need to be remapped on average where k is the number of keys and n is the number of slots consistent hashing was introduced in 1997 as a way of distributing requests among a changing population of web servers each slot is then represented by a node in a distributed system the addition and removal of nodes only requires k n items to be re shuffled when the number of slots nodes change more recently it has been used to reduce the impact of partial system failures in large web applications as to allow for robust caches without incurring the system wide fallout of a failure however the most significant application of consistent hashing has been to form the foundation of distributed hash tables dhts use consistent hashing to partition a keyspace among a distributed set of nodes and additionally provide an overlay network which connects nodes such that the node responsible for any key can be efficiently located 
latex is a document markup language and document preparation system for the tex typesetting program within the typesetting system its name is styled as latex is most widely used by mathematicians scientists engineers philosophers scholars in academia and the commercial world and other professionals as a primary or intermediate format latex is used because of the high quality of typesetting achievable by tex the typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing including numbering and cross referencing tables and figures page layout and bibliographies latex is intended to provide a high level language that accesses the power of tex latex essentially comprises a collection of tex macros and a program to process latex documents because the tex formatting commands are very low level it is usually much simpler for end users to use latex latex was originally written in the early 1980s by leslie lamport at sri international it has become the dominant method for using tex relatively few people write in plain tex anymore the current version is latex2e the term latex refers only to the language in which documents are written not to the editor used to write those documents in order to create a document in latex a tex file must be created using some form of text editor while many text editors work many people prefer to use one of several editors designed specifically for working with latex distributed under the terms of the latex project public license latex is free software 
business activity monitoring is software that aids in monitoring of business activities as those activities are implemented in computer systems 
the rgb color model is an additive color model in which red green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors the name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors red green and blue the main purpose of the rgb color model is for the sensing representation and display of images in electronic systems such as televisions and computers though it has also been used in conventional photography before the electronic age the rgb color model already had a solid theory behind it based in human perception of colors rgb is a device dependent color space different devices detect or reproduce a given rgb value differently since the color elements and their response to the individual r g and b levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer or even in the same device over time thus an rgb value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management typical rgb input devices are color tv and video cameras image scanners and digital cameras typical rgb output devices are tv sets of various technologies computer and mobile phone displays video projectors multicolor led displays and large screens as jumbotron etc color printers on the other hand are not rgb devices but subtractive color devices this article discusses concepts common to all the different color spaces that use the rgb color model which are used in one implementation or another in color image producing technology 
in computer science an interval tree is an ordered tree data structure to hold intervals specifically it allows one to efficiently find all intervals that overlap with any given interval or point it is often used for windowing queries for example to find all roads on a computerized map inside a rectangular viewport or to find all visible elements inside a three dimensional scene the trivial solution is to visit each interval and test whether it intersects the given point or interval which requires Î¸ time where n is the number of intervals in the collection since a query may return all intervals for example if the query is a large interval intersecting all intervals in the collection this is asymptotically optimal however we can do better by considering output sensitive algorithms where the runtime is expressed in terms of m the number of intervals produced by the query 
merge sort is an o comparison based sorting algorithm in most implementations it is stable meaning that it preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output it is an example of the divide and conquer algorithmic paradigm it was invented by john von neumann in 1945

the morris worm or internet worm was one of the first computer worms distributed via the internet it is considered the first worm and was certainly the first to gain significant mainstream media attention it also resulted in the first conviction in the us under the 1986 computer fraud and abuse act it was written by a student at cornell university robert tappan morris and launched on november 2 1988 from mit 
in the x window system xvfb or x virtual framebuffer is an x11 server that performs all graphical operations in memory not showing any screen output from the point of view of the client it acts exactly like any other server serving requests and sending events and errors as appropriate however no output is shown this virtual server does not require the computer it is running on to even have a screen or any input device only a network layer is necessary xvfb is mainly used for testing as an example the following sequence of commands runs the virtual framebuffer as display 1 run a program on it and capture the virtual screen in the file image xwd the result can be shown by running xwud in image xwd or xv image xwd 
top down and bottom up are strategies of information processing and knowledge ordering mostly involving software but also other humanistic and scientific theories in practice they can be seen as a style of thinking and teaching in many cases top down is used as a synonym of analysis or decomposition and bottom up of synthesis a top down approach is essentially breaking down a system to gain insight into its compositional sub systems in a top down approach an overview of the system is first formulated specifying but not detailing any first level subsystems each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail sometimes in many additional subsystem levels until the entire specification is reduced to base elements a top down model is often specified with the assistance of black boxes that make it easier to manipulate however black boxes may fail to elucidate elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model a bottom up approach is piecing together systems to give rise to grander systems thus making the original systems sub systems of the emergent system in a bottom up approach the individual base elements of the system are first specified in great detail these elements are then linked together to form larger subsystems which then in turn are linked sometimes in many levels until a complete top level system is formed this strategy often resembles a seed model whereby the beginnings are small but eventually grow in complexity and completeness however organic strategies may result in a tangle of elements and subsystems developed in isolation and subject to local optimization as opposed to meeting a global purpose 
the web ontology language is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies and is endorsed by the world wide web consortium this family of languages is based on two semantics owl dl and owl lite semantics are based on description logics which have attractive and well understood computational properties while owl full uses a novel semantic model intended to provide compatibility with rdf schema owl ontologies are most commonly serialized using rdf xml syntax owl is considered one of the fundamental technologies underpinning the semantic web and has attracted both academic and commercial interest in october 2007 a new w3c working group was started to extend owl with several new features as proposed in the owl 1 1 member submission this new version called owl 2 has already found its way into semantic editors such as protÃ©gÃ© and semantic reasoners such as pellet and fact

the binary numeral system or base 2 number system represents numeric values using two symbols usually 0 and 1 more specifically the usual base 2 system is a positional notation with a radix of 2 owing to its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates the binary system is used internally by all modern computers 
procedural programming can sometimes be used as a synonym for imperative programming but can also refer to a programming paradigm based upon the concept of the procedure call procedures also known as routines subroutines methods or functions simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out any given procedure might be called at any point during a program s execution including by other procedures or itself a procedural programming language provides a programmer a means to define precisely each step in the performance of a task the programmer knows what is to be accomplished and provides through the language step by step instructions on how the task is to be done using a procedural language the programmer specifies language statements to perform a sequence of algorithmic steps procedural programming is often a better choice than simple sequential or unstructured programming in many situations which involve moderate complexity or which require significant ease of maintainability possible benefits some good examples of procedural programs are the linux kernel git apache server and quake iii arena 
the dynabook concept was created by alan kay in 1968 two years before the founding of xerox parc kay wanted to make a personal computer for children of all ages the ideas led to the development of the xerox alto prototype which was originally called the interim dynabook it embodied all the elements of a graphical user interface or gui as early as 1972 the software component of this research was smalltalk which went on to have a life of its own independent of the dynabook concept the dynabook concept described what is now known as a laptop computer or a tablet pc or slate computer with nearly eternal battery life and software aimed at giving children access to digital media adults could also use a dynabook but the target audience was children when microsoft came up with its tablet pc alan kay was quoted as saying microsoft s tablet pc the first dynabook like computer good enough to criticize a comment he had earlier applied to the apple macintosh kay wanted the dynabook concept to embody the learning theories of jerome bruner and some of what seymour papert who had studied with developmental psychologist jean piaget and who invented the logo programming language was proposing the hardware on which the programming environment ran was relatively irrelevant since the late 1990s kay has been working on the squeak programming system an open source smalltalk based environment which could be seen as a logical continuation of the dynabook concept toshiba also has a line of sub notebook computers called dynabook alan kay is actively involved in the one laptop per child project that uses smalltalk squeak and the concepts of a computer for learning though the hardware required to create a dynabook is here today alan kay still thinks the dynabook hasn t been invented yet because key software and educational curriculum are missing 
in computer science the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern composite allows a group of objects to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object the intent of composite is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part whole hierarchies composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly 
peterson s algorithm is a concurrent programming algorithm for mutual exclusion that allows two processes to share a single use resource without conflict using only shared memory for communication it was formulated by gary peterson in 1981 at the university of rochester while peterson s original formulation worked with only two processes the algorithm can be generalised for more than two as discussed in operating systems review january 1990 
in computer science reference counting is a technique of storing the number of references pointers or handles to a resource such as an object or block of memory it is typically used as a means of deallocating objects which are no longer referenced 
in computer science a construct in a language is called syntactic sugar if it can be removed from the language without any effect on what the language can do functionality and expressive power will remain the same all applications of the construct can be systematically replaced with equivalents that do not use the construct syntactic sugar makes the language sweeter for humans to use things can be expressed more clearly or more concisely or in an alternative style that some may prefer the term was coined by peter j landin when he was working on a lambda calculus enriched with a few operations such as assignment following landin s insights some later programming languages such as ml and scheme were explicitly designed as a language core of essential constructs the convenient higher level features could be desugared and decomposed into that subset this is in fact the usual mathematical practice of building up from primitives 
virtual reality is a technology which allows a user to interact with a computer simulated environment whether that environment is a simulation of the real world or an imaginary world most current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences displayed either on a computer screen or through special or stereoscopic displays but some simulations include additional sensory information such as sound through speakers or headphones some advanced haptic systems now include tactile information generally known as force feedback in medical and gaming applications users can interact with a virtual environment or a virtual artifact either through the use of standard input devices such as a keyboard and mouse or through multimodal devices such as a wired glove the polhemus boom arm and omnidirectional treadmill the simulated environment can be similar to the real world for example simulations for pilot or combat training or it can differ significantly from reality as in vr games in practice it is currently very difficult to create a high fidelity virtual reality experience due largely to technical limitations on processing power image resolution and communication bandwidth however those limitations are expected to eventually be overcome as processor imaging and data communication technologies become more powerful and cost effective over time virtual reality is often used to describe a wide variety of applications commonly associated with its immersive highly visual 3d environments the development of cad software graphics hardware acceleration head mounted displays database gloves and miniaturization have helped popularize the notion in the book the metaphysics of virtual reality michael heim identifies seven different concepts of virtual reality simulation interaction artificiality immersion telepresence full body immersion and network communication the definition still has a certain futuristic romanticism attached people often identify vr with head mounted displays and data suits 
in category theory a monad or triple is an functor together with two associated natural transformations they are important in the theory of pairs of adjoint functors and they generalize closure operators on posets to arbitrary categories the notion of algebras for a monad generalizes classical notions from universal algebra and in this sense monads can be thought of as theories 
collaborative filtering is the process of filtering for information or patterns using techniques involving collaboration among multiple agents viewpoints data sources etc applications of collaborative filtering typically involve very large data sets collaborative filtering methods have been applied to many different kinds of data including sensing and monitoring data such as in mineral exploration environmental sensing over large areas or multiple sensors financial data such as financial service institutions that integrate many financial sources or in electronic commerce and web 2 0 applications where the focus is on user data etc the remainder of this discussion focuses on collaborative filtering for user data although some of the methods and approaches may apply to the other major applications as well the method of making automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting taste information from many users the underlying assumption of cf approach is that those who agreed in the past tend to agree again in the future for example a collaborative filtering or recommendation system for music tastes could make predictions about which music a user should like given a partial list of that user s tastes note that these predictions are specific to the user but use information gleaned from many users this differs from the simpler approach of giving an average score for each item of interest for example based on its number of votes 
in information theory the hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions for which the corresponding symbols are different put another way it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one into the other or the number of errors that transformed one string into the other 
the builder pattern is a software design pattern the intention is to abstract steps of construction of objects so that different implementations of these steps can construct different representations of objects often the builder pattern is used to build products in accordance to the composite pattern a structure pattern 
in computing cross platform is a term used to refer to computer software or computing methods and concepts that are implemented and inter operate on multiple computer platforms cross platform software may be divided into two types one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation e g software written in an interpreted language or pre compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run time packages are common or standard components of all platforms for example a cross platform application may run on microsoft windows on the x86 architecture linux on the x86 architecture and mac os x on either the powerpc or x86 based apple macintosh systems a cross platform application may run on as many as all existing platforms or on as few as two platforms 
the syntax of the c programming language is a set of rules that specifies whether the sequence of characters in a file is conforming c source code the rules specify how the character sequences are to be chunked into tokens the permissible sequences of these tokens and some of the meaning to be attributed to these permissible token sequences c syntax makes use of the maximal munch principle 
in computer science a cache is a collection of data duplicating original values stored elsewhere or computed earlier where the original data is expensive to fetch or to compute compared to the cost of reading the cache in other words a cache is a temporary storage area where frequently accessed data can be stored for rapid access once the data is stored in the cache future use can be made by accessing the cached copy rather than re fetching or recomputing the original data so that the average access time is shorter a cache has proven to be extremely effective in many areas of computing because access patterns in typical computer applications have locality of reference there are several kinds of locality but this article primarily deals with data that are accessed close together in time the data might or might not be located physically close to each other 
in cryptography a keyed hash message authentication code is a type of message authentication code calculated using a specific algorithm involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key as with any mac it may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message any iterative cryptographic hash function such as md5 or sha 1 may be used in the calculation of an hmac the resulting mac algorithm is termed hmac md5 or hmac sha1 accordingly the cryptographic strength of the hmac depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function on the size and quality of the key and the size of the hash output length in bits an iterative hash function breaks up a message into blocks of a fixed size and iterates over them with a compression function for example md5 and sha 1 operate on 512 bit blocks the size of the output of hmac is the same as that of the underlying hash function although it can be truncated if desired truncating the hash image reduces the security of the mac which is bounded above by the birthday attack the construction and analysis of hmacs was first published in 1996 by mihir bellare ran canetti and hugo krawczyk who also wrote rfc 2104 fips pub 198 generalizes and standardizes the use of hmacs hmac sha 1 and hmac md5 are used within the ipsec and tls protocols 
object relational mapping is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in relational databases and object oriented programming languages this creates in effect a virtual object database that can be used from within the programming language there are both free and commercial packages available that perform object relational mapping although some programmers opt to create their own orm tools 
in computer science the compare and swap cpu instruction is a special instruction that atomically compares the contents of a memory location to a given value and if they are the same modifies the contents of that memory location to a given new value the result of the operation must indicate whether it performed the substitution this can be done either with a simple boolean response or by returning the value read from the memory location cas is used to implement synchronization primitives like semaphores and mutexes as well as more sophisticated lock free and wait free algorithms maurice herlihy proved that cas can implement more of these algorithms than atomic read write and fetch and add and that assuming a fairly large amount of memory it can implement all of them algorithms built around cas typically read some key memory location and remember the old value based on that old value they compute some new value then they try to swap in the new value using cas where the comparison checks for the location still being equal to the old value if cas indicates that the attempt has failed it has to be repeated from the beginning the location is re read a new value is computed and the cas is tried again some of these algorithms are affected by and must handle the problem of a false positive match or the aba problem it s possible that between the time the old value is read and the time cas is attempted some other processors or threads change the memory location two or more times such that it acquires a bit pattern which matches the old value the problem arises if this new bit pattern which looks exactly like the old value has a different meaning for instance it could be a recycled address or a wrapped version counter a general solution to this is to use a double length cas the second half is used to hold a counter the compare part of the operation compares the previously read value of the pointer and the counter to the current pointer and counter if they match the swap occurs the new value is written but the new value has an incremented counter this means that if aba has occurred although the pointer value will be the same the counter is exceedingly unlikely to be the same on 64 bit systems with only single length cas a 32 bit pointer and 32 bit counter can often be used with an offset being added to the pointer when actual memory lookup occurs cas and other atomic instructions are sometime thought to be unnecessary in uniprocessor systems because the atomicity of any sequence of instructions can be achieved by disabling interrupts while executing it however disabling interrupts has numerous downsides for example code that is allowed to do so must be trusted not to be malicious and monopolize the cpu as well as to be correct and not accidentally hang the machine in an infinite loop further disabling interrupts is often deemed too expensive to be practical thus even programs only intended to run on uniprocessor machines will benefit from atomic instructions as in the case of linux s futexes in multiprocessor systems it is usually impossible to disable interrupts on all processors at the same time even if it were possible two or more processors could be attempting to access the same semaphore s memory at the same time and thus atomicity would not be achieved the compare and swap instruction allows any processor to atomically test and modify a memory location preventing such multiple processor collisions 
second reality is a demo created by future crew for the assembly 93 demoparty in the pc demo competition second reality placed first with its demonstration of 2d and 3d rendering the demo was released to the public in october 1993 it is considered to be one of the best demos created during the early 1990s on the pc slashdot voted it one of the top 10 hacks of all time 
in mathematics negative numbers in any base are represented in the usual way by prefixing them with a  sign however in computer hardware there are various ways of representing a number s sign this article deals with four methods of extending the binary numeral system to represent signed numbers sign and magnitude ones complement two s complement and excess n modern computers typically use the two s complement representation but other representations are used in some circumstances 
active server pages also known as classic asp was microsoft s first server side script engine for dynamically generated web pages initially released as an add on to internet information services via the windows nt 4 0 option pack it was subsequently included as a free component of windows server developing functionality in asp websites is enabled by the active scripting engine s support of the component object model with each object providing a related group of frequently used functions and data attributes in asp 2 0 there were six built in objects application asperror request response server and session session for example is a cookie based session object that maintains the state of variables from page to page functionality is further extended by objects which when instantiated provide access to the environment of the web server as an example filesystemobject is used to create read update and delete files web pages with the asp file extension use asp although some web sites disguise their choice of scripting language for security purposes pages with the aspx extension are asp net and compiled which makes them faster and more robust than server side scripting in asp which is interpreted at run time however many asp net pages still include some asp scripting such marked differences between asp and asp net have lead to the term classic asp being used which also implies some nostalgia for the simpler platform most asp pages are written in vbscript but any other active scripting engine can be selected instead by using the language directive or the script language language runat server syntax jscript is the other language that is usually available perlscript and others are available as third party installable active scripting engines 
the secd machine is a highly influential virtual machine intended as a target for functional programming language compilers the letters stand for stack environment code dump the internal registers of the machine these registers point to linked lists in memory the machine was the first to be specifically designed to evaluate lambda calculus expressions it was originally described by peter j landin as part of his iswim programming language definition in 1963 the description published by landin was fairly abstract and left many implementation choices open hence the secd machine is often presented in a more detailed form such as peter henderson s lispkit lisp compiler which has been distributed since 1980 since then it has been used as the target for several other experimental compilers in 1989 researchers at the university of calgary worked on a hardware implementation of the machine 
simpson s paradox is a statistical paradox wherein the successes of groups seem reversed when the groups are combined this result is often encountered in social and medical science statistics and occurs when frequency data are hastily given causal interpretation the paradox disappears when causal relations are derived systematically through formal analysis though mostly unknown to laymen simpson s paradox is well known to statisticians and is described in several introductory statistics books many statisticians believe that the mainstream public should be apprised of counterintuitive results such as simpson s paradox in particular to caution against the inference of causal relationships based on the association between two variables edward h simpson described the phenomenon in 1951 along with karl pearson et al and udny yule in 1903 the name simpson s paradox was coined by colin r blyth in 1972 since simpson did not discover this statistical paradox some authors instead have used the impersonal names reversal paradox and amalgamation paradox in referring to what is now called simpson s paradox and the yule simpson effect 
glonass is a radio based satellite navigation system developed by the former soviet union and now operated for the russian government by the russian space forces it is an alternative and complementary to the united states global positioning system and the planned galileo positioning system of the european union development on the glonass began in 1976 with a goal of global coverage by 1991 beginning on 12 october 1982 numerous rocket launches added satellites to the system until the constellation was completed in 1995 following completion the system rapidly fell into disrepair with the collapse of the russian economy beginning in 2001 russia committed to restoring the system and in recent years has diversified introducing the indian government as a partner and accelerated the program with a goal of restoring global coverage by 2009

in computing a symbolic link is a special type of file that contains a reference to another file or directory in the form of an absolute or relative path and that affects pathname resolution symbolic links first appeared in the 4 2bsd release of berkeley unix today they are supported by the posix operating system standard most unix like operating systems windows vista and to some degree in windows 2000 and windows xp symbolic links operate transparently for most operations programs which read or write to files named by a symbolic link will behave as if operating directly on the target file however programs that need to handle symbolic links specially may identify and manipulate them directly a symbolic link merely contains a text string that is interpreted and followed by the operating system as a path to another file or directory it is a file on its own and can exist independently of its target if a symbolic link is deleted its target remains unaffected if the target is moved renamed or deleted any symbolic link that used to point to it continues to exist but now points to a non existing file symbolic links pointing to non existing files are sometimes called orphaned or dangling symbolic links exist in contrast to hard links hard links may not normally point to directories and they can not link paths on different volumes symbolic links may point to any file or directory irrespective of the volumes on which the source and destination reside 
vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points lines curves and shapes or polygon which are all based on mathematical equations to represent images in computer graphics vector graphics formats are complementary to raster graphics which is the representation of images as an array of pixels as it is typically used for the representation of photographic images there are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice there are times when both formats come together an understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools 
dmesg is a command on unix like operating systems that prints the message buffer of the kernel when the computer system is initially booted the kernel is loaded into memory at this stage each device driver present in the kernel probes the system for the existence of relevant hardware if the hardware is located a diagnostic message is produced documenting precisely what was found other elements within the kernel may also produce similar output reporting both the presence of that particular module and the values of any parameters adopted this process typically happens at a speed where individual messages scroll off the top of the screen before they can be read the dmesg command allows these messages to be reviewed in a controlled manner after the system has started even after the system has fully booted the kernel may occasionally produce further diagnostic messages common examples of when this might happen are when i o devices encounter errors or usb devices are hot plugged dmesg provides a mechanism to review these messages at a later time when first produced they will be directed to the system console if the console is in use then these messages may be confused with or quickly overwritten by the output of user programs the output of dmesg can amount to several complete screens for this reason this output is normally reviewed using standard text manipulation tools such as more tail or grep the output is often captured in a permanent system logfile via a logging daemon such as syslog many commercial operating systems display an animated splash screen during this stage of the boot process so the user does not see these messages however there is frequently a mechanism to disable the splash screen and view the messages this is an important diagnostic capability if the system fails to boot there is also usually a method of reviewing these messages subsequent to start up in a manner equivalent to dmesg 
ada is a structured statically typed imperative and object oriented high level computer programming language extended from pascal and other languages it was originally designed by a team led by jean ichbiah of cii honeywell bull under contract to the united states department of defense from 1977 to 1983 to supersede the hundreds of programming languages then used by the dod ada is strongly typed and compilers are validated for reliability in mission critical applications such as avionics software ada is an international standard the current version is defined by joint iso ansi standard combined with major amendment iso iec 8652 1995 amd 1 2007 ada was named after ada lovelace who is often credited as being the first computer programmer 
junit is a unit testing framework for the java programming language created by kent beck and erich gamma junit is one of the xunit family of frameworks that originated with kent beck s sunit junit has spawned its own ecosystem of junit extensions experience gained with junit has been important in the development of test driven development and as a result some knowledge of junit is often presumed in discussions of test driven development junit has been ported to other languages including php c python fortran delphi free pascal perl c  and javascript this family of unit testing frameworks is referred to collectively as xunit testng has many of the same goals as junit junit is linked as a jar at compile time the framework resides under packages junit framework for junit 3 8 and earlier and under org junit for junit 4 and later 
emacs lisp is a dialect of the lisp programming language used by the gnu emacs and xemacs text editors it is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into emacs the remainder being written in c users of emacs commonly write emacs lisp code to customize and extend emacs emacs lisp can also be used as a scripting language much like the unix bourne shell perl python scsh or gnu guile just as with those languages it may be called from the command line or via an executable file its editing functions such as buffers and movement commands complement the features of lisp and work in batch mode emacs lisp is sometimes called elisp at the risk of confusion with an older unrelated lisp dialect with the same name in terms of features it is closely related to the maclisp dialect with some later influence from common lisp it supports imperative and functional programming methods richard stallman chose lisp as the extension language for his rewrite of emacs because of its powerful features including the ability to treat functions as data unlike common lisp scheme existed at the time stallman was rewriting gosling emacs into gnu emacs but it was not used because of scheme s then poor performance on workstations and he had to develop a dialect more easily optimized the lisp dialect used in emacs differs substantially from the more modern common lisp and scheme dialects commonly used for applications programming one of the major differences is that emacs lisp uses dynamic rather than lexical scope by default that is local variables in a calling function can be referenced from a called function without passing pointers or references writing emacs lisp is not the only method of customizing gnu emacs since version 20 gnu emacs has included a customize facility which allows users to set common customization variables through a graphical interface customize works by writing emacs lisp code for the user and is limited to relatively simple customizations not every user needs the full degree of extensibility offered by emacs those that do can write their own emacs lisp code

in computer science a lookup table is a data structure usually an array or associative array often used to replace a runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation the savings in terms of processing time can be significant since retrieving a value from memory is often faster than undergoing an expensive computation lookup tables are also used extensively to validate input values by matching against a list of valid items in an array and in some programming languages may include pointer functions to process the matching input in data analysis applications such as image processing a lookup table is used to transform the input data into a more desirable output format for example a grayscale picture of the planet saturn will be transformed into a color image to emphasize the differences in its rings a classic example of reducing run time computations using lookup tables is to obtain the result of a trigonometry calculation such as the sine of a value calculating trigonometric functions can substantially slow a computing application the same application can finish much sooner when it first precalculates the sine of a number of values for example for each whole number of degrees then when the program requires the sine of a value it can use the lookup table to retrieve the closest sine value from a memory address and may also take the step of interpolating to the sine of the desired value rather than work out the unique value every time using the mathematical formula lookup tables are thus used by mathematics co processors in computer systems an error in a lookup table was responsible for intel s infamous floating point divide bug before the advent of computers printed lookup tables of values were used by people to speed up hand calculations of complex functions such as in trigonometry logarithms and statistical density functions functions of a single variable may be implemented by a simple array functions involving two or more variables require multidimensional array indexing techniques the latter case may thus employ a two dimensional array of power to replace a function to calculate xy for a limited range of x and y values functions that have more than one result may be implemented with lookup tables that are arrays of structures as mentioned there are intermediate solutions that use tables in combination with a small amount of computation often using interpolation pre calculation combined with interpolation can produce higher accuracy for values that fall between two precomputed values this technique requires slightly more time to be performed but can greatly enhance accuracy in applications that require the higher accuracy depending on the values being precomputed pre computation with interpolation can also be used to shrink the lookup table size while maintaining accuracy in image processing lookup tables are often called luts and give an output value for each of a range of index values one common lut called the colormap or palette is used to determine the colors and intensity values with which a particular image will be displayed windowing in computed tomography refers to a related concept while often effective employing a lookup table may nevertheless result in a severe penalty if the computation that the lut replaces is relatively simple memory retrieval time and the complexity of memory requirements can increase application operation time and system complexity relative to what would be required by straight formula computation the possibility of polluting the cache may also become a problem table accesses for large tables will almost certainly cause a cache miss this phenomenon is increasingly becoming an issue as processors outpace memory a similar issue appears in rematerialization a compiler optimization in some environments such as the java programming language table lookups can be even more expensive due to mandatory bounds checking involving an additional comparison and branch for each lookup there are two fundamental limitations on when it is possible to construct a lookup table for a required operation one is the amount of memory that is available one cannot construct a lookup table larger than the space available for the table although it is possible to construct disk based lookup tables at the expense of lookup time the other is the time required to compute the table values in the first instance although this usually needs to be done only once if it takes a prohibitively long time it may make the use of a lookup table an inappropriate solution tables can however be statically defined in many cases avoiding any additional processing once compiled 
a moo is a text based online virtual reality system to which multiple users are connected at the same time the term moo is used in two distinct but related senses one is to refer to those programs descended from the original moo server and the other is to refer to any mud that uses object oriented techniques to organize its database of objects particularly if it does so in a similar fashion to the original moo or its derivatives most of this article refers to the original moo and its direct descendants but see non descendant moos for a list of moo like systems the original moo server was authored by stephen white based on his experience from creating the programmable tinymuck system there was additional later development and maintenance from lambdamoo administrator and former xerox parc employee pavel curtis one of the most distinguishing features of a moo is that its users can perform object oriented programming within the server ultimately expanding and changing how the server behaves to everyone examples of such changes include authoring new rooms and objects creating new generic objects for others to use and changing the way the moo interface operates the programming language used for extension is the moo programming language and many moos feature convenient libraries of verbs that can be used by programmers in their coding known as utilities the moo programming language is a domain specific programming language 
the nx bit which stands for no execute is a technology used in cpus to segregate areas of memory for use by either storage of processor instructions or for storage of data a feature normally only found in harvard architecture processors however the nx bit is being increasingly used in conventional von neumann architecture processors for security reasons an operating system with support for the nx bit may mark certain areas of memory as non executable the processor will then refuse to execute any code residing in these areas of memory the general technique known as executable space protection is used to prevent certain types of malicious software from taking over computers by inserting their code into another program s data storage area and running their own code from within this section this is known as a buffer overflow attack intel markets the feature as the xd bit for execute disable amd uses the name enhanced virus protection 
javaserver pages is a java technology that allows software developers to create dynamically generated web sites with html xml or other document types in response to a web client request the technology allows java code and certain pre defined actions to be embedded into static content the jsp syntax adds additional xml like tags called jsp actions to be used to invoke built in functionality additionally the technology allows for the creation of jsp tag libraries that act as extensions to the standard html or xml tags tag libraries provide a platform independent way of extending the capabilities of a web server jsps are compiled into java servlets by a jsp compiler a jsp compiler may generate a servlet in java code that is then compiled by the java compiler or it may generate byte code for the servlet directly jsps can also be interpreted on the fly reducing the time taken to reload changes

in object oriented programming inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined the inheritance concept was invented in 1967 for simula the new classes known as derived classes take over attributes and behavior of the pre existing classes which are referred to as base classes it is intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification inheritance provides the support for representation by categorization in computer languages categorization is a powerful mechanism number of information processing crucial to human learning by means of generalization and cognitive economy inheritance is also sometimes called generalization because the is a relationships represent a hierarchy between classes of objects for instance a fruit is a generalization of apple orange mango and many others one can consider fruit to be an abstraction of apple orange etc conversely since apples are fruit apples may naturally inherit all the properties common to all fruit such as being a fleshy container for the seed of a plant an advantage of inheritance is that modules with sufficiently similar interfaces can share a lot of code reducing the complexity of the program inheritance therefore has another view a dual called polymorphism which describes many pieces of code being controlled by shared control code inheritance is typically accomplished either by overriding one or more methods exposed by ancestor or by adding new methods to those exposed by an ancestor complex inheritance or inheritance used within a design that is not sufficiently mature may lead to the yo yo problem 
structural equation modeling is a statistical technique for testing and estimating causal relationships using a combination of statistical data and qualitative causal assumptions this view of sem was articulated by the geneticist sewall wright the economists trygve haavelmo and herbert simon and formally defined by judea pearl using a calculus of counterfactuals structural equation models encourages confirmatory rather than exploratory modeling thus it is suited to theory testing rather than theory development it usually starts with a hypothesis represents it as a model operationalises the constructs of interest with a measurement instrument and tests the model the causal assumptions embedded in the model often have falsifiable implications which can be tested against the data with an accepted theory or otherwise confirmed model sem can also be used inductively by specifying the model and using data to estimate the values of free parameters often the initial hypothesis requires adjustment in light of model evidence but sem is rarely used purely for exploration among its strengths is the ability to model constructs as latent variables this allows the modeler to explicitly capture the unreliability of measurement in the model which in theory allows the structural relations between latent variables to be accurately estimated factor analysis path analysis and regression all represent special cases of sem in sem the qualitative causal assumptions are represented by the missing variables in each equation as well as vanishing covariances among some error terms these assumptions are testable in experimental studies and must be confirmed judgmentally in observational studies an alternative technique for specifying structural equation models using partial least squares path modeling has been implemented in software such as lvpls plsgraph smartpls and xlstat some feel this is better suited to data exploration more ambitiously the tetrad project aims to develop a way to automate the search for possible causal models from data 
docbook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation it was originally intended for writing technical documents related to computer hardware and software but it can be used for any other sort of documentation as a semantic language docbook enables its users to create document content in a presentation neutral form that captures the logical structure of the content that content can then be published in a variety of formats including html pdf man pages and html help without requiring users to make any changes to the source 
data integration is the process of combining data residing at different sources and providing the user with a unified view of these data this process emerges in a variety of situations both commercial and scientific data integration appears with increasing frequency as the volume and the need to share existing data explodes it has been the focus of extensive theoretical work and numerous open problems remain to be solved in management practice data integration is frequently called enterprise information integration 
a path is the general form of a file or directory name specifying a unique location in a file system a path points to a file system location by following the directory tree hierarchy expressed in a string of characters in which path components separated by a delimiting character represent each directory the delimiting character is most commonly the slash the backslash character or colon though some operating systems may use a different delimiter paths are used extensively in computer science to represent the directory file relationships common in modern operating systems and are essential in the construction of uniform resource locators a path can be either absolute or relative a full path or absolute path is a path that points to the same location on one file system regardless of the working directory or combined paths it is usually written in reference to a root directory a relative path is a path relative to the working directory of the user or application so the full absolute path may not need to be given 
a software developer is a person or organization concerned with facets of the software development process wider than design and coding a somewhat broader scope of computer programming or a specialty of project managing including some aspects of software product management this person may contribute to the overview of the project on the application level rather than component level or individual programming tasks software developers are often still guided by lead programmers but also encompasses the class of freelance software developers other names which are often used in the same close context are software analyst and software engineer with time and a little luck differences between system design software development and programming are more apparent already in the current market place there can be found a segregation between programmers and developers being that one who actually implements is not the same as the one who designs the class structure or hierarchy even more so that developers become systems architects those who design the multi leveled architecture or component interactions of a large software system a programmer is responsible for writing code but a developer could be involved in wider aspects of the software development process such as in a large company there may be employees whose sole responsibility may consist of only one of the phases above in smaller development environments a few or even a single individual might handle the complete process 
document type definition is one of several sgml and xml schema languages and is also the term used to describe a document or portion thereof that is authored in the dtd language a dtd is primarily used for the expression of a schema via a set of declarations that conform to a particular markup syntax and that describe a class or type of document in terms of constraints on the structure of that document a dtd may also declare constructs that are not always required to establish document structure but that may affect the interpretation of some documents xml documents are described using a subset of dtd which imposes a number of restrictions on the document s structure as required per the xml standard dtds are written in a formal syntax that explains precisely which elements and entities may appear where in the document and what the elements contents and attributes are dtd is native to the sgml and xml specifications and since its introduction other specification languages such as xml schema and relax ng have been released with additional functionality as an expression of a schema a dtd specifies in effect the syntax of an application of sgml or xml such as the derivative language html or xhtml this syntax is usually a less general form of the syntax of sgml or xml in a dtd the structure of a class of documents is described via element and attribute list declarations element declarations name the allowable set of elements within the document and specify whether and how declared elements and runs of character data may be contained within each element attribute list declarations name the allowable set of attributes for each declared element including the type of each attribute value if not an explicit set of valid value 
an instruction set is a list of all the instructions and all their variations that a processor can execute instructions include an instruction set or instruction set architecture is the part of the computer architecture related to programming including the native data types instructions registers addressing modes memory architecture interrupt and exception handling and external i o an isa includes a specification of the set of opcodes the native commands implemented by a particular cpu design instruction set architecture is distinguished from the microarchitecture which is the set of processor design techniques used to implement the instruction set computers with different microarchitectures can share a common instruction set for example the intel pentium and the amd athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set but have radically different internal designs this concept can be extended to unique isas like timi present in the ibm system 38 and ibm as 400 timi is an isa that is implemented as low level software and functionally resembles what is now referred to as a virtual machine it was designed to increase the longevity of the platform and applications written for it allowing the entire platform to be moved to very different hardware without having to modify any software except that which comprises timi itself this allowed ibm to move the as 400 platform from an older cisc architecture to the newer power architecture without having to recompile any parts of the os or software associated with it nowadays there are several open source operating systems which could be easily ported on any existing general purpose cpu because the compilation is the essential part of their design 
the euclidean algorithm is an efficient algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers if g represents the gcd then g is the largest number that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder in other words a and b are both multiples of g and can be written as a mg and b ng where m and n have no divisor in common the euclidean algorithm is the oldest known algorithm and has many theoretical and practical applications such as modern integer factorization algorithms and the rsa algorithm a public key encryption method widely used in electronic commerce the euclidean algorithm is a series of steps in which the gcd is related to the gcd of two smaller numbers in particular it rests on the fact that the gcd of two numbers remains the same when one is subtracted from the other if q multiples of b are subtracted from a the remainder r is divisible by g because r mgÂ  Â qng g although this is true for any integer q the euclidean algorithm chooses q to make the remainder r as small as possible it follows that gcdÂ  Â gcd where r is smaller than b for illustration let a 1989 and b 867 the euclidean algorithm begins by subtracting multiples of b from a until the nonnegative remainder r0 is less than b in this case q0 2 and r0 a q0b 255 which is less than b in the next step b takes the place of a and r0 takes the place of b the algorithm subtracts multiples of r0 from b until the nonnegative remainder r1 is less than r0 in this case q1 3 and r1 b q1r0 102 which is less than r0 the process continues until the remainder is zero which must happen in a finite number of steps for natural numbers and many other types of numbers in this case the final nonzero remainder is g 51 the greatest common divisor the euclidean algorithm is considered efficient because the number of steps required increases logarithmically with the size of the two integers it is never more than five times the number of digits in the smaller integer the euclidean algorithm is the oldest known algorithm the ancient greek geometer euclid described it in books 7 and 10 of his elements applying it to both natural numbers and real numbers the algorithm may have been developed centuries before euclid possibly by mathematicians in the school of pythagoras the algorithm was re discovered in india and china to aid in solving diophantine equations which occur in many areas of science and mathematics the algorithm was generalized to other types of numbers such as algebraic integers in the 19th century the euclidean algorithm has many theoretical and practical applications it is a fundamental tool in modern number theory for example in proving the unique factorization of a set of numbers or in deriving theorems such as lagrange s four square theorem it can be used to solve various diophantine equations such as finding numbers that satisfy multiple congruences or multiplicative inverses of a finite field by reversing the algorithm g can be expressed as a linear sum of a and b that is g saÂ  Â tb where s and t are integers the euclidean algorithm is also used to construct continued fractions an accurate approximation method and in the sturm chain method for finding the real roots of a polynomial finally it can be used to classify commutative rings in modern abstract algebra a set of numbers are said to form a euclidean domain if an analog of euclid s algorithm can be defined on them

in computer science coroutines are program components that generalize subroutines to allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at certain locations coroutines are well suited for implementing more familiar program components such as cooperative tasks iterators infinite lists and pipes the term coroutine was originated by melvin conway in his seminal 1963 paper 
e mail spoofing is a term used to describe fraudulent e mail activity in which the sender address and other parts of the e mail header are altered to appear as though the e mail originated from a different source e mail spoofing is a technique commonly used for spam e mail and phishing to hide the origin of an e mail message by changing certain properties of the e mail such as the from return path and reply to fields ill intentioned users can make the e mail appear to be from someone other than the actual sender the result is that although the e mail appears to come from the address indicated in the from field it actually comes from another source occasionally the source of the spam e mail is indicated in the reply to field if this is the case and the initial e mail is replied to the delivery will be sent to the address specified in the reply to field which could be the spammer s address however most spam emails forge this address too and replying to it will annoy an innocent third party 
markdown is a lightweight markup language originally created by john gruber and aaron swartz to help maximum readability and publishability of both its input and output forms the language takes many cues from existing conventions for marking up plain text in email markdown converts its marked up text input to valid well formed xhtml and replaces left pointing angle brackets and ampersands with their corresponding character entity references markdown was originally implemented in perl by gruber but has since been re implemented by others in a variety of programming languages it is distributed under a bsd style license and is included with or available as a plugin for several content management systems

in computer science a type system may be defined as a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute loosely a type system associates one type with each program value by examining the flow of these values a type system attempts to prove that no type errors can occur the type system in question determines what constitutes a type error but a type system generally seeks to guarantee that operations expecting a certain kind of value are not used with values for which that operation makes no sense a compiler may use the static type of a value to optimize the storage it needs and the choice of algorithms for operations on the value in many c compilers the float data type for example is represented in 32 bits in accordance with the ieee specification for single precision floating point numbers c thus uses floating point specific operations on those values the depth of type constraints and the manner of their evaluation affect the typing of the language a programming language may further associate an operation with varying concrete algorithms on each type in the case of type polymorphism type theory is the study of type systems although the concrete type systems of programming languages originate from practical issues of computer architecture compiler implementation and language design 
audio stream input output is a computer soundcard driver protocol for digital audio specified by steinberg providing a low latency and high fidelity interface between a software application and a computer s sound card whereas microsoft s directsound is commonly used as a stereo input and output for non professional users asio allows musicians and sound engineers to process their audio via windows computer software instead of external hardware asio bypasses the normal audio path from the user application through layers of intermediary windows operating system software so that the application connects directly to the soundcard hardware each layer that is bypassed means a reduction in latency the delay between an application sending sound to the sound being reproduced by the soundcard in this way asio offers a relatively simple way of accessing multiple audio inputs and outputs independently its main strength lies in its method of bypassing the inherently high latency of windows audio mixing kernels allowing direct high speed communication with audio hardware unlike kmixer an unmixed asio output is bit identical that is the bits sent to the sound card are identical to those of the original wav file thus having higher audio fidelity interface support is normally restricted to microsoft windows since other operating systems do not have such mixer latency problems in windows vista kmixer has been removed and replaced by a new wavert port driver wavert cannot provide synchronized audio to multiple devices and does not support external clocks as of 2007 there is also an experimental asio driver for wine a windows layer for linux this wineasio driver uses the jack sound server as its audio back end and allows many asio aware applications to run with low latency under wine 

 web 2 0 refers to a perceived second generation of web development and design that facilitates communication secure information sharing interoperability and collaboration on the world wide web web 2 0 concepts have led to the development and evolution of web based communities hosted services and applications such as social networking sites video sharing sites wikis blogs and folksonomies the term was first used by dale dougherty and craig cline and shortly after became notable after the o reilly media web 2 0 conference in 2004 although the term suggests a new version of the world wide web it does not refer to an update to any technical specifications but rather to changes in the ways software developers and end users utilize the web according to tim o reilly o reilly has noted that the 2 0 refers to the historical context of web businesses coming back after the 2001 collapse of the dot com bubble in addition to the distinguishing characteristics of the projects that survived the bust or thrived thereafter tim berners lee inventor of the world wide web has questioned whether one can use the term in any meaningful way since many of the technological components of web 2 0 have existed since the early days of the web

in mathematical logic and computer science lambda calculus also written as Î» calculus is a formal system designed to investigate function definition function application and recursion it was introduced by alonzo church and stephen cole kleene in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics but has emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability or recursion theory and forms the basis of a paradigm of computer programming called functional programming in the lambda calculus functions are first class entities they are passed as arguments and returned as results thus lambda expressions are a reification of the concept of an unnamed procedure without side effects the lambda calculus can be thought of as an idealized minimalistic programming language it is capable of expressing any algorithm and it is this fact that makes the model of functional programming an important one functional programs are stateless and deal exclusively with functions that accept and return data but they produce no side effects in state and thus make no alterations to incoming data modern functional languages building on the lambda calculus include erlang haskell lisp ml and scheme as well as more recent languages like clojure f nemerle and scala the lambda calculus continues to play an important role in mathematical foundations through the curry howard correspondence however as a naÃ¯ve foundation for mathematics the untyped lambda calculus is unable to avoid set theoretic paradoxes this article deals with the untyped lambda calculus as originally conceived by church most modern applications concern typed lambda calculi 
a programming language is a machine readable artificial language designed to express computations that can be performed by a machine particularly a computer programming languages can be used to create programs that specify the behavior of a machine to express algorithms precisely or as a mode of human communication many programming languages have some form of written specification of their syntax and semantics since computers require precisely defined instructions some are defined by a specification document while others have a dominant implementation the earliest programming languages predate the invention of the computer and were used to direct the behavior of machines such as automated looms and player pianos thousands of different programming languages have been created mainly in the computer field with many more being created every year 
moscow is a prioritisation technique used in business analysis and software development to reach a common understanding with stakeholders on the importance they place on the delivery of each requirement also known as moscow prioritisation or moscow analysis the capital letters in moscow stand for the o s in moscow are added simply to make the word pronounceable and are often left lower case to indicate that they don t stand for anything while some suggest it should be muscow moscow is preferred as it is more easily remembered as the capital city of the russian federation moscow is an acceptable variant with the o s in upper case 
a central processing unit or processor is an electronic circuit that can execute computer programs this broad definition can easily be applied to many early computers that existed long before the term cpu ever came into widespread usage the term itself and its initialism have been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s the form design and implementation of cpus have changed dramatically since the earliest examples but their fundamental operation has remained much the sameearly cpus were custom designed as a part of a larger sometimes one of a kind computer however this costly method of designing custom cpus for a particular application has largely given way to the development of mass produced processors that are made for one or many purposes this standardization trend generally began in the era of discrete transistor mainframes and minicomputers and has rapidly accelerated with the popularization of the integrated circuit the ic has allowed increasingly complex cpus to be designed and manufactured to tolerances on the order of nanometers both the miniaturization and standardization of cpus have increased the presence of these digital devices in modern life far beyond the limited application of dedicated computing machines modern microprocessors appear in everything from automobiles to cell phones to children s toys 
y combinator is an american seed stage startup funding firm started in 2005 by paul graham robert morris trevor blackwell and jessica livingston y combinator provides seed money advice and connections at two 3 month programs per year from its inception to 2008 one program was held in each of the us cities of cambridge massachusetts and mountain view california in january 2009 paul graham announced that henceforth the cambridge program would be closed and all future programs would take place in silicon valley in exchange they take an average of about 6 of the company s equity unusual among startup funding firms y combinator provides very little money about 5000 5000 per founder this reflects graham s conviction that between free software dynamic languages the web and moore s law the cost of founding a startup has greatly decreased as of january 2008 y combinator had funded 80 startups the best known of which are reddit loopt and justin tv the number of startups funded in each cycle has been gradually increasing the first cycle in summer 2005 had eight startups in the summer 2007 cycle there were 19 y combinator was started after graham gave a talk at his alma mater harvard which became how to start a startup he suggested founders seek seed funding from angel investors preferably those who had made money in technology he half jokingly added but not me but feeling guilty he soon after organized y combinator to offer seed funding to startups

support vector machines are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression viewing input data as two sets of vectors in an n dimensional space an svm will construct a separating hyperplane in that space one which maximizes the margin between the two data sets to calculate the margin two parallel hyperplanes are constructed one on each side of the separating hyperplane which are pushed up against the two data sets intuitively a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the neighboring datapoints of both classes since in general the larger the margin the lower the generalization error of the classifier

chef is an esoteric programming language designed by david morgan mar it is based on the manipulation of data values in a number of stacks each program consists at minimum of the following the joke is that the variables tend to be named after basic foodstuffs the stacks are called mixing bowls and the instructions for manipulating them mix stir etc a program then reads much like a cooking recipe a hello world example program in chef the phrase hello world is encoded as ascii values in the amount specifiers in the recipe the ingredient names themselves are variable names and are here named with a starting letter matching the letter encoded in the number in front for convenience notice the first letter of each word forms the phrase hellozworldp when read in reverse order the order of the words is reversed because when the phrase hello world is printed out the ingredients are popped from the stack the last element to be put in the stack is the first element out of the stack a fibonacci example program can be found on the language s website 
in computer science session hijacking refers to the exploitation of a valid computer session sometimes also called a session key to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system in particular it is used to refer to the theft of a magic cookie used to authenticate a user to a remote server it has particular relevance to web developers as the http cookies used to maintain a session on many web sites can be easily stolen by an attacker using an intermediary computer or with access to the saved cookies on the victim s computer tcp session hijacking is when a hacker takes over a tcp session between two machines since most authentication only occurs at the start of a tcp session this allows the hacker to gain access to a machine a popular method is using source routed ip packets this allows a hacker at point a on the network to participate in a conversation between b and c by encouraging the ip packets to pass through its machine if source routing is turned off the hacker can use blind hijacking whereby it guesses the responses of the two machines thus the hacker can send a command but can never see the response however a common command would be to set a password allowing access from somewhere else on the net a hacker can also be inline between b and c using a sniffing program to watch the conversation this is known as a man in the middle attack a common component of such an attack is to execute a denial of service attack against one end point to stop it from responding this attack can be either against the machine to force it to crash or against the network connection to force heavy packet loss 
a disassembler is a computer program that translates machine language into assembly language the inverse operation to that of an assembler a disassembler differs from a decompiler which targets a high level language rather than an assembly language disassembly the output of a disassembler is often formatted for human readability rather than suitability for input to an assembler making it principally a reverse engineering tool assembly language source code generally permits the use of symbolic constants and programmer comments these are usually removed from the assembled machine code by the assembler if so a disassembler operating on the machine code would produce disassembly lacking these constants and comments the disassembled output becomes more difficult for a human to interpret than the original annotated source code some disassemblers make use of the symbolic debugging information present in object files such as elf the interactive disassembler allow the human user to make up mnemonic symbols for values or regions of code in an interactive session human insight applied to the disassembly process often parallels human creativity in the code writing process disassembly is not an exact science on cisc platforms with variable width instructions or in the presence of self modifying code it is possible for a single program to have two or more reasonable disassemblies determining which instructions would actually be encountered during a run of the program reduces to the proven unsolvable halting problem 
data transfer object formerly known as value objects or vo is a design pattern used to transfer data between software application subsystems dtos are often used in conjunction with data access objects to retrieve data from a database the difference between data transfer objects and business objects or data access objects is that a dto does not have any behaviour except for storage and retrieval of its own data the value object pattern in domain driven design is not the same as the dto pattern 
in computer science and related disciplines considered harmful is a phrase popularly used in the titles of diatribes and other critical essays it was popularized by edsger dijkstra s letter go to statement considered harmful published in the march 1968 communications of the acm in which he criticized the excessive use of the goto statement in programming languages of the day and advocated structured programming instead the original title of the letter as submitted to cacm was a case against the goto statement but cacm editor niklaus wirth changed the title to the now immortalized go to statement considered harmful frank rubin published a criticism of dijkstra s letter in the march 1987 cacm where it appeared under the title goto considered harmful considered harmful the may 1987 cacm printed further replies both for and against under the title goto considered harmful considered harmful considered harmful dijkstra s own response to this controversy was titled on a somewhat disappointing correspondence according to linguist mark liberman considered harmful was a journalistic clichÃ© used in headlines well before the dijkstra article he cites the headline over a letter published august 12 1949 in the new york times rent control controversy enacting now of hasty legislation considered harmful 
sisal is an agave agave sisalana that yields a stiff fiber traditionally used in making twine rope and also dartboards it is has sometimes been incorrectly referred to as sisal hemp because hemp was for centuries a major source for fiber so other fibers were sometimes named after it the plant s origin is uncertain while traditionally it was deemed to be a native of yucatan there are no records of botanical collections from there gentry hypothesized a chiapas origin on the strength of traditional local usage in the 19th century sisal cultivation spread to florida the caribbean islands and brazil as well as to countries in africa notably tanzania and kenya and asia the first commercial plantings in brazil were made in the late 1930 s and the first sisal fiber exports from there were made in 1948 it was not until the 1960 s that brazilian production really accelerated and the first of many spinning mills were established today brazil is the major world producer of sisal there are both positive and negative environmental impacts from sisal growing traditionally used for rope and twine sisal has many uses including paper cloth wall coverings and carpets 
the gnu core utilities or coreutils is a package of gnu software containing many of the basic tools such as cat ls and rm needed for unix like operating systems it is a combination of a number of earlier packages including textutils shellutils and fileutils along with some other miscellaneous utilities 
in compiler design static single assignment form is an intermediate representation in which every variable is assigned exactly once existing variables in the original ir are split into versions new variables typically indicated by the original name with a subscript so that every definition gets its own version in ssa form use def chains are explicit and each contains a single element ssa was developed by ron cytron jeanne ferrante barry rosen mark wegman and ken zadeck researchers at ibm in the 1980s in functional language compilers such as those for scheme ml and haskell continuation passing style is generally used where one might expect to find ssa in a compiler for fortran or c ssa and cps are formally equivalent so optimizations and transformations formulated in terms of one immediately apply to the other 
pastry is an overlay and routing network for the implementation of a distributed hash table similar to chord the key value pairs are stored in a redundant peer to peer network of connected internet hosts the protocol is bootstrapped by supplying it with the ip address of a peer already in the network and from then on the routing table is dynamically built and repaired because of its redundant and decentralized nature there is no single point of failure and any single node can leave the network at any time without warning and with little or no chance of data loss the protocol is also capable of using a routing metric supplied by an outside program such as ping or traceroute to determine the best routes to store in its routing table

in cryptography blowfish is a keyed symmetric block cipher designed in 1993 by bruce schneier and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective cryptanalysis of it has been found to date however the advanced encryption standard now receives more attention schneier designed blowfish as a general purpose algorithm intended as a replacement for the aging des and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms at the time blowfish was released many other designs were proprietary encumbered by patents or were commercial government secrets schneier has stated that blowfish is unpatented and will remain so in all countries the algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone notable features of the design include key dependent s boxes and a highly complex key schedule 
in mathematics a ternary operation is an n ary operation with n 3 a ternary operation on a set a takes any given three elements of a and combines them to form a single element of a an example of a ternary operation is the product in a heap in computer science a ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments the arguments and result can be of different types many programming languages that use c like syntax feature a ternary operator which defines a conditional expression since this operator is often the only existing ternary operator in the language it is sometimes simply referred to as the ternary operator the ternary conditional operator was anticipated by algol which allowed if then else to be used in expressions for example languages that emphasize functional programming such as scheme may define the plain if then else construction in terms of this ternary operator for example the scheme expression a b is equivalent in semantics to the c expression Â  aÂ  b though it had been delayed for several years by disagreements over syntax a ternary operator for python was approved as python enhancement proposal 308 and was added to the 2 5 release in september 2006 python s ternary operator differs from the common operator in the order of its operands the general form is op1 if condition else op2 this form invites considering op1 as the normal value and op2 as an exceptional case before 2 5 one could use the syntax which also takes care of only evaluating expressions which are actually needed in order to prevent side effects version 9 of visual basic has added a ternary operator if in addition to the existing iif function that had existed previously as a true operator it does not have the side effects and potential inefficiencies of the iif function the syntaxes of the tokens are similar if op2 vs iif as mentioned above the function call has significant disadvantages because the subexpressions must all be evaluated according to visual basic s evaluation strategy for function calls and the result will always be of type variant or object the ifoperator however does not suffer from these problems as it supports conditional evaluation and determines the type of the expression based on the types of its operands 
soap is an anionic surfactant used in conjunction with water for washing and cleaning that historically comes in solid bars but also in the form of a thick liquid soap consisting of sodium or potassium salts of fatty acids is obtained by reacting fat with lye in a process known as saponification the fats are hydrolyzed by the base yielding alkali salts of fatty acids and glycerol many cleaning agents today are technically not soaps but detergents which are less expensive and easier to manufacture

code injection is the exploitation of a computer bug that is caused by processing invalid data code injection can be used by an attacker to introduce code into a computer program to change the course of execution the results of a code injection attack can be disastrous for instance code injection is used by some computer worms to propagate 
the josephus problem is a theoretical problem occurring in computer science and mathematics there are people standing in a circle waiting to be executed after the first man is executed certain number of people are skipped and one man is executed then again people are skipped and a man is executed the elimination proceeds around the circle until only the last man remains who is given freedom the task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you survive 
publish subscribe is an asynchronous messaging paradigm where senders of messages are not programmed to send their messages to specific receivers rather published messages are characterized into classes without knowledge of what subscribers there may be subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest without knowledge of what publishers there are this decoupling of publishers and subscribers can allow for greater scalability and a more dynamic network topology pub sub is a sibling of the message queue paradigm and is typically one part of a larger message oriented middleware solution most messaging systems support in their api both the pub sub and message queue models 
a design pattern in architecture and computer science is a formal way of documenting a solution to a design problem in a particular field of expertise the idea was introduced by the architect christopher alexander in the field of architecture and has been adapted for various other disciplines including computer science an organized collection of design patterns that relate to a particular field is called a pattern language 
object management group is a consortium originally aimed at setting standards for distributed object oriented systems and is now focused on modeling and model based standards 
gopher is a distributed document search and retrieval network protocol designed for the internet its goal is to function as an improved form of anonymous ftp enhanced with hyperlinking features similar to those of the world wide web the gopher protocol offers some features not natively supported by the web and imposes a much stronger hierarchy on information stored on it its text menu interface is well suited to computing environments that rely heavily on remote computer terminals common in universities at the time of its creation in 1991 until 1993 
queueing theory is the mathematical study of waiting lines the theory enables mathematical analysis of several related processes including arriving at the queue waiting in the queue and being served by the server at the front of the queue the theory permits the derivation and calculation of several performance measures including the average waiting time in the queue or the system the expected number waiting or receiving service and the probability of encountering the system in certain states such as empty full having an available server or having to wait a certain time to be served 
twisted is an event driven network programming framework written in python and licensed under the mit license twisted projects variously support tcp udp ssl tls ip multicast unix domain sockets a large number of protocols and much more twisted is based on the event driven programming paradigm which means that users of twisted write short callbacks which are called by the framework 
business objects are objects in an object oriented computer program that represent the entities in the business domain that the program is designed to support for example an order entry program might have business objects to represent each orders line items and invoices business objects are sometimes called domain objects a domain model represents the set of domain objects and the relationships between them a business object often encapsulates all of the data and business behavior associated with the entity that it represents business objects don t necessarily need to represent objects in an actual business though they often do they can represent any object related to the domain for which a developer is creating business logic the term is used to distinguish between the objects a developer is creating or using related to the domain and all the other types of object he or she may be working with such as user interface widgets and database objects such as tables or rows 
ruby on rails often shortened to rails or ror is an open source web application framework for the ruby programming language it is intended to be used with an agile development methodology which is used by web developers for rapid development 
awk is a programming language that is designed for processing text based data either in files or data streams and was created at bell labs in the 1970s the name awk is derived from the family names of its authors alfred aho peter weinberger and brian kernighan however it is not commonly pronounced as a string of separate letters but rather to sound the same as the name of the bird auk awk when written in all lowercase letters refers to the unix or plan 9 program that runs other programs written in the awk programming language awk is a language for processing files of text a file is treated as a sequence of records and by default each line is a record each line is broken up into a sequence of fields so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field the second word as the second field and so on an awk program is of a sequence of pattern action statements awk reads the input a line at a time a line is scanned for each pattern in the program and for each pattern that matches the associated action is executed  alfred v ahoawk is an example of a programming language that extensively uses the string datatype associative arrays and regular expressions the power terseness and limitations of awk programs and sed scripts inspired larry wall to write perl because of their dense notation all these languages are often used for writing one liner programs awk is one of the early tools to appear in version 7 unix and gained popularity as a way to add computational features to a unix pipeline a version of the awk language is a standard feature of nearly every modern unix like operating system available today awk is mentioned in the single unix specification as one of the mandatory utilities of a unix operating system besides the bourne shell awk is the only other scripting language available in a standard unix environment implementations of awk exist as installed software for almost all other operating systems 
sharpdevelop is a free and open source ide for the c visual basic net boo and f and ironpython programming languages it is typically used as an alternative to microsoft s visual studio net early in its development there was a fork to mono gtk called monodevelop which includes multi platform support for code completion sharpdevelop uses its own parsers for c and vb net they were generated using a grammar description and a modified version of the coco r compiler generator of the university of linz the source code contains this generator for boo the parser from the boo compiler is used but resolving the type of expressions and type inference is done with custom code that supports lazy evaluation of the types sharpdevelop 1 1 can import projects written with visual studio sharpdevelop 2 0 can open and edit them directly it also can translate whole projects from vb net to c and vice versa sharpdevelop 2 0 has an integrated debugger it uses its own debugging library that communicates with the microsoft net runtime using com interop while sharpdevelop 2 0 uses the same msbuild project files as visual studio it is still able to use other net compilers such as older framework versions or the mono compiler 
the personal software process is a subset of the capability maturity model processes readily applicable to individual software engineers it was first defined in 1994 by watts humphrey in his book a discipline for software engineering as part of the software process program of the software engineering institute at carnegie mellon university the psp is a quantified method aimed toward the improvement of the quality and productivity of the personal work of individual software engineers personal software process and psp are registered service marks of the carnegie mellon university the psp philosophy is largely based on reviews at every stage of the development cycle the psp is a development methodology of plan driven software development approach other methodologies of plan driven are tsp rup 
before code is written an outline of the desired behavior is written that description is implemented in pseudocode and then each line of pseudo code is implemented in the target language only when the entire unit of code is completely written analyzed and reviewed is it compiled and run it is expected to compile and run first time if it does not every error including syntax errors needs a root cause analysis the philosophy is that by manually examining the code in such detail to exclude all detectable errors a better design will be produced than would be produced by a code compile fix cycle psp has been likened to applying six sigma toward software development mukesh jain led large scale deployment of psp tsp in microsoft india within 6 months more than 2 3 of the projects shipped were without any defects and 94 of the projects were delivered on time 
fuzzy logic is a form of multi valued logic derived from fuzzy set theory to deal with reasoning that is approximate rather than precise in binary sets with binary logic in contrast to fuzzy logic named also crisp logic the variables may have a membership value of only 0 or 1 just as in fuzzy set theory with fuzzy logic the set membership values can range between 0 and 1 in fuzzy logic the degree of truth of a statement can range between 0 and 1 and is not constrained to the two truth values true false as in classic predicate logic and when linguistic variables are used these degrees may be managed by specific functions as discussed below the term fuzzy logic emerged as a consequence of the development of the theory of fuzzy sets by lotfi zadeh a paper introducing the concept without using the term was published by r h wilkinson in 1963 and thus preceded fuzzy set theory wilkinson was the first one to redefine and generalize the earlier multivalued logics in terms of set theory the main purpose of his paper following his first proposals in his 1961 electrical engineering master thesis was to show how any mathematical function could be simulated using hardwired analog electronic circuits he did this by first creating various linear voltage ramps which were then selected in a logic block using diodes and resistor circuits which implemented the maximum and minimum fuzzy logic rules of the inclusive or and the and operations respectively he called his logic analog logic in 1965 lotfi zadeh axiomatized fuzzy set theory thereby creating the set theoretical equivalent of the analog logic of wilkinson not giving wilkinson any credit fuzzy logic has been applied to diverse fields from control theory to artificial intelligence yet still remains controversial among most statisticians who prefer bayesian logic and some control engineers who prefer traditional two valued logic 
the class of printf functions is a class of functions typically associated with curly bracket programming languages that accept a string parameter which specifies a method for rendering a number of other parameters into a string usually this string is then printed on the standard output stream but variants exist that perform other tasks with the result characters in the format string are usually copied literally into the function s output with the other parameters being rendered into the resulting text at points marked by format specifiers which are typically introduced by a character a literal percent sign can be copied into the output using the escape sequence 
electronic data interchange refers to the structured transmission of data between organizations by electronic means it is used to transfer electronic documents from one computer system to another from one trading partner to another trading partner it is more than mere e mail for instance organizations might replace bills of lading and even checks with appropriate edi messages it also refers specifically to a family of standards including the x12 series however edi also exhibits its pre internet roots and the standards tend to focus on ascii formatted single messages rather than the whole sequence of conditions and exchanges that make up an inter organization business process in 1992 a survey of canadian businesses found at least 140 that had adopted some form of edi but that many not benefited from implementing edi and that they in fact been disadvantaged by it the national institute of standards and technology in a 1996 publication defines electronic data interchange as the computer to computer interchange of strictly formatted messages that represent documents other than monetary instruments edi implies a sequence of messages between two parties either of whom may serve as originator or recipient the formatted data representing the documents may be transmitted from originator to recipient via telecommunications or physically transported on electronic storage media it goes on further to say that in edi the usual processing of received messages is by computer only human intervention in the processing of a received message is typically intended only for error conditions for quality review and for special situations for example the transmission of binary or textual data is not edi as defined here unless the data are treated as one or more data elements of an edi message and are not normally intended for human interpretation as part of online data processing edi can be formally defined as the transfer of structured data by agreed message standards from one computer system to another without human intervention most other definitions used are variations on this theme even in this era of technologies such as xml web services the internet and the world wide web edi is still the data format used by the vast majority of electronic commerce transactions in the world 
in object oriented programming a class is a programming language construct that is used as a blueprint to create objects this blueprint includes attributes and methods that the created objects all share usually a class represents a person place or thing it is an abstraction of a concept within a computer program fundamentally it encapsulates the state and behavior of that which it conceptually represents it encapsulates state through data placeholders called member variables it encapsulates behavior through reusable code called methods more technically a class is a cohesive package that consists of a particular kind of metadata it describes the rules by which objects behave these objects are referred to as instances of that class a class has both an interface and a structure the interface describes how the class and its instances can be interacted with via methods while the structure describes how the data is partitioned into attributes within an instance a class may also have a representation at runtime which provides runtime support for manipulating the class related metadata in object oriented design a class is the most specific type of an object in relation to a specific layer programming languages that support classes all subtly differ in their support for various class related features most support various forms of class inheritance many languages also support features providing encapsulation such as access specifiers

there are a variety of specifications associated with web services these specifications are in varying degrees of maturity and are maintained or supported by various standards bodies and entities specifications may complement overlap and compete with each other web service specifications are occasionally referred to collectively as ws  though there is not a single managed set of specifications that this consistently refers to nor a recognized owning body across them all the reference term ws is more of a general nod to the fact that many specifications are named with ws as their prefix this page includes many of the specifications that might be considered a part of ws 
macintoshneverwinter nights produced by bioware and published by infogrames is a third person perspective computer role playing game that is based on third edition dungeons dragons and forgotten realms rules it was originally to be published by interplay entertainment but the publisher s financial difficulties forced the change infogrames released neverwinter nights for windows on june 18 2002 bioware released the freely downloadable linux client in june 2003 macsoft released a mac os x port in august 2003 two expansion packs were released in mid and late 2003 and a third in 2005 on october 31 2006 the sequel neverwinter nights 2 was released followed by its first expansion in late 2007 and its second one at the end of 2008 the game was based on the concept of building a internet like model for a massively multiplayer game allowing the end users to host the server the belief was this model would create a potentially infinite massively multiplayer game framework the game was named after the original neverwinter nights online game the first graphical mmorpg which ran from 1991 to 1997 on aol the core release includes the game engine a campaign that can be played as single player or multiplayer and the aurora toolset used for creating custom content based on the same engine 
the c programming language is a well known computer science book written by brian kernighan and dennis ritchie the latter of whom originally designed and implemented the language the book was central to the development and popularization of the c programming language and is still widely read and used today because the book was co authored by the original language designer and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the de facto standard for the language the book is regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on c 
the diamond square algorithm is a method for generating highly realistic heightmaps for computer graphics it is a slightly better algorithm than the three dimensional implementation of the midpoint displacement algorithm which produces two dimensional landscapes it is also known as the random midpoint displacement fractal the cloud fractal or the plasma fractal because of the plasma effect produced when applied the idea was first introduced by gavin s p miller who described it as flawed the algorithm starts with a 2d grid then randomly generates terrain height from four seed values arranged in a grid of points so that the entire plane is covered in squares
